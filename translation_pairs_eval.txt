Be vigilant on behalf of your life. Do not let your lamps be extinguished, and do not relax your loins. But become prepared. For you do not know the hour in which our Lord is coming.

οὐ γὰρ ὠφελήσει ὑμᾶς ὁ πᾶς χρόνος τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν, ἐὰν μὴ ἐν τῷ ἐσχάτῳ καιρῷ τελειωθῆτε.	For all the time of your trust will not profit you, if you do not become complete in the last season.
ἐν γὰρ ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις πληθυνθήσονται οἱ ψευδοπροφῆται καὶ οἱ φθορεῖς, καὶ στραφήσονται τὰ πρόβατα εἰς λύκους, και ἡ ἀγάπη στραφήσεται εἰς μῖσος.	For in the last days, the false prophets and the corruptors will be multiplied, and the sheep will be turned into wolves, and love will be turned into hate.
αὐξανούσης γὰρ τῆς ἀνομίας μισήσουσιν ἀλλήλους καὶ διώξουσι καὶ παραδώσουσι, καὶ τότε φανήσεται ὁ κοσμοπλανὴς ὡς υἱὸσ θεοῦ, καὶ ποιήσει σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα, καὶ ἡ γῆ παραδοθήσεται εἰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιήσει ἀθέμιτα, ἃ οὐδέποτε γέγονεν ἐξ αἰῶνος.	For when the lawlessness increases, they will hate one another, and they will persecute and deliver up, and then the deceiver of creation will appear as God's son, and he will do signs and wonders. And the land will be given up into his hands. And he will do lawless things which have never been done from the age.
τότε ἥξει ἡ κτίσις τῶν ἀντρώπων εἰς τὴν πύρωσιν τῆς δοκιμασίας, καὶ σκανδαλισθήσονται πολλοὶ καὶ ἀπολοῦνται, οἱ δὲ ὑπομείναντες ἐν τῇ πίστει αὐτῶν σωθήσονται ὑπ’ αὐτου τοῦ καταθέματος.	Then human creation will come into the fire of examination, and many will stumble and be destroyed. But those who endure in their trust will be saved from this accursed thing.
καὶ τότε φανήσεται τὰ σημεῖα τῆς ἀληθείας·	And then the signs of truth will appear.
πρῶτον σημεῖον ἐκπετάσεως ἐν οὐρανῷ, εἶτα σημεῖον φωνῆς σάπιγγος, καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν.	First, the sign of an opening in Heaven, then the sign of a trumpet's sound, and thirdly, a resurrection of dead people.
οὐ πάντων δέ, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἐρρέθη· Ἥξει ὁ κύριος καὶ πάντες οἱ ἅγιοι μετ’ αὐτοῦ.	But not of all people; on the contrary, as it was declared, "The Lord will come, and all the holy ones with him."
τότε ὄψεται ὁ κόσμος τὸν κύριον ἐρχόμενον ἐπάνω τῶν νεφελῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.	Then creation will see the Lord coming on the clouds of the sky.
Πᾶς γὰρ ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθέναι, ἀντιχριστός ἐστιν·	For everyone who does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is an anti-Christ;
καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ σταυροῦ, ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστίν·	and whosoever does not confess the testimony of the Cross is of the devil:
καὶ ὃς ἂν μεθοδεύῃ τὰ λόγια τοῦ κυρίου πρὸς τὰς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας καὶ λέγῃ μήτε ἀνάστασιν μήτε κρίσιν, οὗτος πρωτότοκός ἐστι τοῦ σατανᾶ.	and whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord for his own lusts, and says that there is neither resurrection nor judgment, this man is the first-born of Satan.
διὰ δὲ τὴν ὑποδρομὴν βληθέντος τοῦ παιδός, τὸ μὲν μειράκιον οὐ δικαίως ἐπικαλεῖται, οὐδένα γὰρ ἔβαλε τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ σκοποῦ ἀφεστώτων· ὁ δὲ παῖς εἴπερ ἑστὼς φανερὸς ὑμῖν ἐστι μὴ βληθείς, ἑκουσίως δ’ ὑπὸ τὴν φορὰν τοῦ ἀκοντίου ὑπελθών, ἔτι σαφεστέρως δηλοῦται διὰ τὴν αὑτοῦ ἁμαρτίαν ἀποθανών· οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἐβλήθη ἀτρεμίζων καὶ μὴ διατρέχων.	It was because he ran in front of the javelin that the boy was struck. The lad is therefore accused without just cause, as he did not strike anyone standing clear of the target. At the same time, since it is plain to you that the boy was not struck while standing still, but was struck only after deliberately moving into the path of the javelin, you have still clearer proof that his death was due to an error on his own part. Had he stood still and not run across, he would not have been struck.
ὥστ’ ἐν γάλακτι θρόμβον αἵματος σπάσαι. οὔτοι μάταιον·	No it drew in clotted blood with the milk. Truly it is not without meaning
νῦν δὲ γέγονε κληρωτός.	but now it has been made an office elected by lot.

καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βόος καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ἀπαγγελίᾳ ἀπηγγέλη μοι ὅσα πεποίηκας μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς σου μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν ἄνδρα σου, καὶ πῶς κατέλιπες τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου καὶ τὴν γῆν γενέσεώς σου, καὶ ἐπορεύθης πρὸς λαὸν ὃν οὐκ ᾔδεις ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης.	So Boaz answered and said to her, “A report was given to me concerning everything that you have done in the company of your mother-in-law after your husband died, and how you left behind your father and your mother and the land of your birth and reached a people that you did not know ⌊yesterday or the day before⌋.
τρίτος δὲ καὶ τέταρτος ἦν τῶν ἐν ἑτέρῳ πίνακι προκειμένων ἐς τὸ μέλλον ὑπάτων Πλάγκου μὲν ὁ ἀδελφὸς Πλώτιος, Ἀσινίου δὲ ὁ πενθερὸς Κοΐντιος.

καὶ ἦν δὲ ἄξιος ὁ ἀγὼν κατά τε ταῦτα καὶ ὅτι οὐχὶ Ἀθηναίων μόνον περιεγίγνοντο, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πολλῶν ξυμμάχων, καὶ οὐδ’ αὐτοὶ αὖ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ μετὰ τῶν ξυμβοηθησάντων σφίσιν, ἡγεμόνες τε γενόμενοι μετὰ Κορινθίων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ τὴν σφετέραν πόλιν ἐμπαρασχόντες προκινδυνεῦσαί τε καὶ τοῦ ναυτικοῦ μέγα μέρος προκόψαντες.	Nor were these the only considerations that gave dignity to the struggle. They would thus conquer not only the Athenians but also their numerous allies, and conquer not alone, but with their companions-in-arms, commanding side by side with the Corinthians and Lacedaemonians, having offered their city to stand in the van of danger, and having been in a great measure the pioneers of naval success.
τὴν δ’ εὐπορίαν τῆς ὕλης, ἣν τροφὴν ἑαυτῷ ποιεῖται τὸ τρεφόμενον, ἐξ ἑτέρας τινὸς ἔχειν ἐδείκνυτο δυνάμεως ἐπισπᾶσθαι πεφυκυίας τὸν οἰκεῖον χυμόν, εἶναι δ’ οἰκεῖον ἑκάστῳ τῶν μορίων χυμόν, ὃς ἂν ἐπιτήδειος εἰς τὴν ἐξομοίωσιν ᾖ, καὶ τὴν ἕλκουσαν αὐτὸν δύναμιν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐνεργείας ἑλκτικήν τέ τινα καὶ ἐπισπαστικὴν ὀνομάζεσθαι.

καίτοι μακρῷ γ’ ἦν ἄμεινον οὐχ ὁμόσε χωρεῖν τοῖς φαινομένοις ἀλλ’ ἐκείνοις ἀναθέσθαι τὸ πᾶν.	Is it, then, these facts only which are plainly irreconcilable with the views of Asclepiades?

Θέογνις γὰρ καὶ Πείσων ἔλεγον ἐν τοῖς τριάκοντα περὶ τῶν μετοίκων, ὡς εἶέν τινες τῇ πολιτείᾳ ἀχθόμενοι· καλλίστην οὖν εἶναι πρόφασιν τιμωρεῖσθαι μὲν δοκεῖν, τῷ δ’ ἔργω χρηματίζεσθαι· πάντως δὲ τὴν μὲν πόλιν πένεσθαι τὴν δ’ ἀρχὴν δεῖσθαι χρημάτων.	Theognis and Peison stated before the Thirty that among the resident aliens that there might be some who were embittered against their administration, and that therefore they had an excellent pretext for appearing to punish while in reality making money; in any case, the State was impoverished, and the government needed funds.

Noticing that there were at Phocaea two opposing parties, he held a secret conference with one of them,
καὶ διηγήσατο ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τὸ ἐνύπνιον αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἰωσὴφ καὶ εἶπεν Ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου ἦν ἄμπελος ἐναντίον μου·	And the chief cupbearer described his dream to Joseph and said, “In my sleep there was a vine before me.

οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτό γ’ ἐστὶν οὔτ’ εἰκὸς οὔτε δυνατόν, ἐμὲ μὲν περὶ πολλοὺς ἡμαρτηκέναι, τοὺς δὲ ταῖς συμφοραῖς δι’ ἐμὲ περιπεπτωκότας ἡσυχίαν ἔχειν καὶ μὴ τολμᾶν ἐγκαλεῖν, ἀλλὰ πραοτέρους ἐν τοῖς ἐμοῖς εἶναι κινδύνοις τῶν μηδὲν ἠδικημένων, ἐξὸν αὐτοῖς δηλώσασιν ἃ πεπόνθασι τὴν μεγίστην παρ’ ἐμοῦ λαβεῖν τιμωρίαν.	For surely it is neither probable nor possible both that I, on the one hand, have wronged many people and that those, on the other hand, who have been visited with misfortune through me are silent and refrain from accusing me; nay, are kinder to me when my life is in peril than those who have suffered no injury, especially since all they have to do is to testify to the wrongs I have done them in order to obtain the fullest reparation.

The Thurians sent numerous messengers to negotiate for the release of the captives, and the Tarentines won the negotiators over to Hannibal, who thereupon released all the Thurian prisoners he held.
ἐπὶ τούτοις ἔφην εἰρημένοις πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἓν βραχύ τοῖς περὶ Νίκανδρον ἀείσω ξυνετοῖσι τῇ γὰρ ἕκτῃ τοῦ νέου μηνὸς ὅταν κατάγῃ εἷς τὴν Πυθίαν εἰς τὸ πρυτανεῖον, ὁ πρῶτος ὑμῖν γίγνεται τῶν τριῶν κλήρων εἰς, τὰ πέντε, πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐκείνης τὰ τρία τοῦ δὲ τὰ δύο βάλλοντες.	After what I have spoken to you, I said, Yet one short word to those about Nicander, I’ll sing to men of skill. For on the sixth day of the new moon, when you introduce the Pythia into the Prytaneum, the first of the three lots tends with you towards five, casting neither three, nor two, one to another.
ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ οἶμαι, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, οὐδ’ ἐάν τις ὑμᾶς ὡς μάλιστα ἄκων μεγάλα κακὰ ἐργάσηται, ὧν μὴ οἷόν τε γενέσθαι ἐστὶν ὑπερβολήν, οὐ τούτου ἕνεκα οὐ δεῖν ὑμᾶς ἀμύνεσθαι.	My own opinion, gentlemen, is that, however much against his will a man may have done you a wrong so great that it cannot be exceeded, this is no reason why you should not protect yourselves. And then, there are some further facts that you must remember
ἅπαντες γὰρ ἅμα ἀποκρινοῦνται, ὅτι Χαβρία μὲν διὰ τὴν περὶ Νάξον ναυμαχίαν, Ἰφικράτει δὲ ὅτι μόραν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀπέκτεινε, Τιμοθέῳ δὲ διὰ τὸν περίπλουν τὸν εἰς Κέρκυραν, καὶ ἄλλοις, ὧν ἑκάστῳ πολλὰ καὶ καλὰ κατὰ πόλεμον ἔργα πέπρακται.

καὶ πολλοὶ καὶ τῶν ἐν Ῥώμῃ δυνατῶν ἕτεροι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀφικνοῦντο, οἷς ἀπήρεσκεν ἡ τῆς πολιτείας εὐστάθεια.	While Cinna was thus occupied, the consuls, Octavius and Merula, fortified the city with trenches, repaired the walls, and planted engines on them.
ἀγαθοῖς γὰρ εἶναι ὑμῖν προσήκει τὰ πολέμια οὐ διὰ ξυμμάχων παρουσίαν ἑκάστοτε, ἀλλὰ δι’ οἰκείαν ἀρετήν, καὶ μηδὲν πλῆθος πεφοβῆσθαι ἑτέρων, οἵ γε μηδὲ ἀπὸ πολιτειῶν τοιούτων ἥκετε, ἐν αἷς οὐ πολλοὶ ὀλίγων ἄρχουσιν, ἀλλὰ πλεόνων μᾶλλον ἐλάσσους, οὐκ ἄλλῳ τινὶ κτησάμενοι τὴν δυναστείαν ἢ τῷ μαχόμενοι κρατεῖν.	The bravery that you habitually display in war does not depend on your having allies at your side in this or that encounter, but on your native courage; nor have numbers any terrors for citizens of states like yours, in which the many do not rule the few, but rather the few the many, owing their position to nothing else than to superiority in the field.
ἀλλ’ οὐδεμία πώποτε γνώμη παρανομωτέρα γεγένηται.	Never was a more unlawful motion made.

ἐλθὼν δὲ μεγάλης μὲν αὐτὸν ἐνέπλησε χαρᾶς, μεγάλης δὲ πάλιν ἐλπίδος Σικελίαν, συνευχομένην καὶ συμφιλοτιμουμένην Πλάτωνα μὲν Φιλίστου περιγενέσθαι, φιλοσοφίαν δὲ τυραννίδος.	His arrival filled Dionysius with great joy, and the Sicilians again with great hope; they all prayed and laboured zealously that Plato might triumph over Philistus, and philosophy over tyranny.
σὺ δὲ πάπταινε καὶ φρόντιζε, μηδ᾽ αὐθαδίαν εὐβουλίας ἀμείνον᾽ ἡγήσῃ ποτέ.	may you consider warily and reflect, and never deem stubbornness better than wise counsel.
ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν Πύρρωνα κατά τινας ἐζηλώκει καὶ τῆς διαλεκτικῆς εἴχετο καὶ τῶν Ερετρικῶν ἥπτετο λόγων, ὅθεν καὶ ἐλέγετο ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ ὑπ’ Ἀρίστωνος·	He was devoted to dialectic and adopted the methods of argument introduced by the Eretrian school. On account of this Ariston said of him
καὶ ἔσται τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ξυρηθήσεται πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ, τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν πώγωνα καὶ τὰς ὀφρύας καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ ξυρηθήσεται· καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι, καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται.

καὶ εἶδεν Δαλειδὰ ὅτι ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ πᾶσαν τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων λέγουσα Ἀνάβητε ἔτι τὸ ἅπαξ τοῦτο, ὅτι ἀπήγγειλέν μοι τὴν πᾶσαν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν.	And Delilah saw that he told to her all his heart, and she sent and summoned the rulers of the Philistines, saying, “Go up yet again this once, because he reported to me the whole of his heart.” And the rulers of the Philistines went up to her and brought the money in their hands.
μετὰ γὰρ κρίματος σωθήσεται ἡ αἰχμαλωσία αὐτῆς καὶ μετὰ ἐλεημοσύνης·	For her captivity will escape with justice and with mercy.
καὶ εἰ λέγετε ὑμεῖς Οὐ μὴ καθίσωμεν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀκοῦσαι φωνῆς Κυρίου,	And if you say, ‘We will ⌊by no means⌋ settle in this land, so as not to listen to the voice of the Lord,
Νῦν χαίρω ἐν τοῖς παθήμασιν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνταναπληρῶ τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ χριστοῦ ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἡ ἐκκλησία·	I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church,

σπερο με, δομινε, πλαξιτυρυμ εις, ιτα υτ ιν δομο μεα λιβεντερ ηαβιτεντ σεμπερ.	I hope, Sir, that I shall please them so that they may ever willingly dwell in my house.
Τόμος τέταρτος ἐν ᾧ Κῦρος.	In the fourth volume are included
ὁμοίως τε καὶ τὰς ἄλλας περὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα τρέπεσθαι. ἕπονται δὲ τῇ μὲν φρονήσει εὐβουλία καὶ σύνεσις, τῇ δὲ σωφροσύνῃ εὐταξία καὶ κοσμιότης, τῇ δὲ δικαιοσύνῃ ἰσότης καὶ εὐγνωμοσύνη, τῇ δὲ ἀνδρείᾳ ἀπαραλλαξία καὶ εὐτονία.	Similarly each of the other virtues is concerned with its own proper sphere. To wisdom are subordinate good counsel and understanding to temperance, good discipline and orderliness to justice, equality and fair-mindedness to courage, constancy and vigour.

ἐκ τούτου κυροῦται μὲν ὁ περὶ τῆς χώρας νόμος, αἱροῦνται δὲ τρεῖς ἄνδρες ἐπὶ τὴν διάκρισιν καὶ διανομήν, αὐτὸς Τιβέριος καὶ Κλαύδιος Ἄππιος ὁ πενθερὸς καὶ Γάιος Γράγχος ὁ ἀδελφός, οὐ παρὼν οὗτος, ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ Σκηπίωνι πρὸς Νομαντίαν στρατευόμενος.	After this the agrarian law was passed, and three men were chosen or he survey and distribution of the public land, Tiberius himself, Appius Claudius his father-in-law, and Caius Gracchus his brother, who was not at Rome, but was serving under Scipio in the expedition against Numantia.
προύγραφον οὖν ἡμέραν ἐν ᾗ χειροτονήσουσι στρατηγὸν ἐς Ἰβηρίαν.	Accordingly a day was fixed for choosing a general for Spain.
Εἶπεν δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν Ὄρθρισον τὸ πρωὶ καὶ στῆθι ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρός αὐτόν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν Ἐβραίων Ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου ἵνα λατρεύσωσίν μοι.	And then the Lord spoke to Moses, “Rise up early, early in the day, and stand in front of Pharaoh and speak to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Send out my people so that they may worship me.
ἡγεῖτο δ’ αὐτῷ, εἰ νῷ ἔχεις, πρῶτον μὲν ἀλήθεια, ἣν διώκειν αὐτὸν πάντως καὶ πάντῃ ἔδει ἢ ἀλαζόνι ὄντι μηδαμῇ μετεῖναι φιλοσοφίας ἀληθινῆς.	The leader of the choir for him, if you recollect, was truth. That he was to seek always and altogether, on pain of being an impostor without part or lot in true philosophy.
αἰδώς τε θεῶν ἢ νέμεσις ἀνδρῶν ἢ φθόνου φόβος οὐδεὶς ἔτι τοῖς γιγνομένοις ἐπῆν, ἀλλὰ ἐς ἔργα ἀνήμερα καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔργοις ἐς ὄψεις ἐτρέποντο ἀθεμίστους, κτιννύντες τε ἀνηλεῶς καὶ περιτέμνοντες αὐχένας ἀνδρῶν ἤδη τεθνεώτων καὶ προτιθέντες τὰς συμφορὰς ἐς φόβον ἢ κατάπληξιν ἢ θέαν ἀθέμιστον.	Neither reverence for the gods, nor the indignation of men, nor the fear of odium for their acts existed any longer among them. After committing savage deeds they turned to hideous sights. They killed remorselessly and severed the necks of men already dead, and they paraded these horrors before the public eye, either to inspire fear and terror, or for a monstrous spectacle.
τῷ δὲ λαῷ τούτῳ ἐγενήθη καρδία ἀνήκοος καὶ ἀπειθής, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν καὶ ἀπήλθοσαν.	But ⌊this nation has a disobedient and unbelieving heart⌋. And they have turned away and departed.

In gratitude we honored them with the highest honors and set up their statues where stands the image of Zeus the Savior, near to it and to one another, a memorial both of the magnitude of their benefactions and of their mutual friendship.
παρθένῳ μὲν ἔτι οὔσῃ Παιδί, γημαμένην δὲ τῷ Διὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν Τελείαν, διενεχθεῖσαν δὲ ἐφ’ ὅτῳ δὴ ἐς τὸν Δία καὶ ἐπανήκουσαν ἐς τὴν Στύμφαλον ὠνόμασεν ὁ Τήμενος Χήραν.	when married to Zeus he called her Grown-up when for some cause or other she quarrelled with Zeus and came back to Stymphalus, Temenus named her Widow.
Ἔβλεπον οὖν εἰς ἀλλήλους οἱ μαθηταί, ἀπορούμενοι περὶ τίνος λέγει.	Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.
κατ’ ἀναλογίαν δὲ ἡ ἀριστοκρατικὴ ἀρίστη καὶ βασιλική. οὐ γὰρ ταὐτὸν δίκαιον τῷ ὑπερέχοντι καὶ ὑπερεχομένῳ, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀνάλογον.	whereas the aristocratic partnership (which is the best) and the royal are proportional, for it is just for superior and inferior to have not the same share but proportional shares
μιᾶς μὲν οὖν οὐκ εὔλογον εἶναι·	it is not probable that both subjects belong to one science;
τοῦ πεδίου δὲ ἡ δυσχέρεια, διὰ χειμάρρους ἐκτεταφρευμένου, τὴν πλεονεξίαν τὸ πλῆθος ἀπεστέρει.	There were frequent cavalry engagements, as Antony had a much larger force of horse, but the difficulty of the ground, which was cut up by torrents, deprived him of the advantage of numbers.

πολλοὶ λέγουσιν Τίς δείξει ἡμῖν τὰ ἀγαθά; ἐσημειώθη ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς τὸ φῶς τοῦ προσώπου σου, Κύριε·	Many are saying, “Who will show for us good things?” The light of your face, O Lord, was manifested upon us.
ταῦτα φυλασσόμενος τετελεσμένον εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν ἰσοῦσθαι νύκτας τε καὶ ἤματα, εἰσόκεν αὖτις γῆ πάντων μήτηρ καρπὸν σύμμικτον ἐνείκῃ.	Observe all this until the year is ended and you have nights and days of equal length, and Earth, the mother of all, bears again her various fruit.

ἦν δὲ καὶ πυός τις ἔνδον καὶ λαγῷα τέτταρα, εἴ τι μὴ ξήνεγκεν αὐτῶν ἡ γαλῆ τῆς ἑσπέρας·	there were also some curds and four pieces of hare, unless the cat stole them last evening, for I know not what the infernal noise was that i heard in the house.
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος αὐτῇ, Μὴ φοβοῦ, Μαριάμ· εὗρες γὰρ χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ.	Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
καὶ ἔστησα αὐτοῖς τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν· οὕτως ἐδωρήσατο ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ σύμβουλοι αὐτοῦ καὶ μεγιστᾶνες καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραήλ.	and I weighed for them the silver and the gold and the temple vessels of the house of our Lord. In this way the king and his counselors and nobles and all Israel were presented.
ἀλλά, καθὼς γέγραπται, Οἷς οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη περὶ αὐτοῦ, ὄψονται· καὶ οἳ οὐκ ἀκηκόασιν συνήσουσιν.	but as it is written: "To whom He was not announced, they shall see; And those who have not heard shall understand."
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδ’ ἐκεῖν’ ὑμᾶς λέληθεν, ὅτι τὰς κτήσεις καὶ τὰς ἰδίας καὶ τὰς κοινάς, ἂν ἐπιγένηται πολὺς χρόνος, κυρίας καὶ πατρῴας ἅπαντες εἶναι νομίζουσιν.	Then again you are doubtless well aware that possessions, whether private or public, when they have remained for a long time in the hands of their owner, are by all men acknowledged to be hereditary and incontestable.
καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἄνδρες ἄνομοι καὶ ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἄλκιμος ἡγεῖται αὐτῶν βουλόμενος ἱερατεύειν.	And there came to him all lawless and the ungodly men from Israel; and Alcimus, who wanted to be high priest, was going before them.
Πελοπίδᾳ τῷ Ἱππόκλου γένος μὲν ἦν εὐδόκιμον ἐν Θήβαις ὥσπερ Ἐπαμεινώνδᾳ, τραφεὶς δὲ ἐν οὐσίᾳ μεγάλῃ καὶ παραλαβὼν ἔτι νέος λαμπρὸν οἶκον ὥρμησε τῶν δεομένων τοῖς ἀξίοις βοηθεῖν, ἵνα κύριος ἀληθῶς φαίνοιτο χρημάτων γεγονώς, ἀλλὰ μὴ δοῦλος.	Pelopidas the son of Hippoclus was of a highly honourable family in Thebes, as was Epaminondas, and having been reared in affluence, and having inherited in youth a splendid estate, he devoted himself to the assistance of worthy men who needed it, that he might be seen to be really master of his wealth, and not its slave.
οὓς οὐ χρὴ μιμεῖσθαι τοὺς ἀρετῆς ἀντιποιουμένους, ἀλλὰ πολὺ μᾶλλον τὴν τῆς σοφίας καὶ τῆς δικαιοσύνης καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἀρετῶν δύναμιν.	But men who pretend to excellence must not imitate their example but much rather the power of wisdom and of justice and of the other virtues.
ὡμολογήσαμεν δὲ τοὺς μὲν ἀγαθοὺς χρησίμους εἶναι, τοὺς δὲ μοχθηροὺς ἀχρήστους.	and we have agreed that good men are useful, and bad ones useless. He was obliged to agree to this.
Καὶ ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ πλαστοῖς λόγοις ὑμᾶς ἐμπορεύσονται· οἷς τὸ κρίμα ἔκπαλαι οὐκ ἀργεῖ, καὶ ἡ ἀπώλεια αὐτῶν οὐ νυστάξει.	By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.
ἐξαργυρισάμενόν τε τὴν οὐσίαν καὶ γὰρ ἦν τῶν ἐπιφανῶν ἀθροίσαντα πρὸς τὰ ἑκατὸν διακόσια τάλαντα, τοῖς πολίταις διανεῖμαι ταῦτα.	So he turned his property into money,—for he belonged to a distinguished family,—and having thus collected about 200 talents, distributed that sum among his fellow-citizens.
ὁ δὲ πλανηθεὶς εἰς Σπάρτην τε καὶ Ἀρκαδίαν ἅπασαν, καὶ διαβὰς τὸν Ἰσθμόν, εἰς Μαραθῶνα τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀφικόμενος τοὺς ἐγχωρίους διελυμαίνετο.	But the bull roamed to Sparta and all Arcadia, and traversing the Isthmus arrived at Marathon in Attica and harried the inhabitants.
Πρὸς τὰς ἀναζωγραφήσεις πρὸς Τιμώνακτα α′.	Against the Touching up of Paintings, addressed to Timonax, one book.
ἆρ’ οὖν καὶ ὅμοιόν τε καὶ ἀνόμοιον ἑαυτῷ τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις;	Is it, then, also like and unlike itself and others?
Βλέπεις τὸν ποιμένα τοῦτον;	Do you see this shepherd?
τὰ μὲν γὰρ αἰσθητὰ καθ’ Ἡράκλειτον, τὰ δὲ νοητὰ κατὰ Πυθαγόραν, τὰ δὲ πολιτικὰ κατὰ Σωκράτην ἐφιλοσόφει.	In his doctrine of sensible things he agrees with Heraclitus, in his doctrine of the intelligible with Pythagoras, and in political philosophy with Socrates.
ὁ δὲ τὸν μὲν παῖδα Κυζικηνοῖς ἀνατρέφειν παρέδωκε, μέχρι σχολάσειεν ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν καταγαγεῖν, ἐν δὲ τοῖς θησαυροῖς εὗρε παράδοξον χρυσίου τι πλῆθος καὶ ἀργύρου.	Brutus delivered the boy to the inhabitants of Cyzicus to be cared for until he (Brutus) should have leisure to restore him to his kingdom. Among the treasures he found an unexpected quantity of gold and silver. This he stamped and converted into money.
νῦν οὖν αὐτοί τε ἀγωνίζεσθε καὶ ἡμῖν εἴ του δεῖ ἐπιστέλλετε·	So do you also play your parts now and if you have need of anything send us word.
παῦσον δ᾽ ἡμῶν τὰς ὑπονοίας τὰς περικόμψους, αἷς στωμυλλόμεθ᾽ εἰς ἀλλήλους·	put an end to this tittle - tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another.
Καρχηδόνιοι δ’ ἐπέστελλον Ἀννίβᾳ λῦσαι τὰς ἀνοχὰς καὶ πολεμεῖν Σκιπίωνι, κρῖναι δ’ ὅτι τάχιστα τὸν πόλεμον μάχῃ διὰ τὴν ἀπορίαν.	Then the Carthaginians ordered Hannibal to break the truce and begin war against Scipio, and to fight as soon as possible on account of the scarcity of provisions.
φίλος φίλοισι τοῖς ἐκεῖ καλῶς θανοῦσιν κατὰ χθονὸς ἐμπρέπων σεμνότιμος ἀνάκτωρ, πρόπολός τε τῶν μεγίστων χθονίων ἐκεῖ τυράννων·	—Welcomed there below by your comrades who nobly fell, a ruler of august majesty, distinguished even beneath the earth, and minister of the mightiest, the deities who rule in the nether world.
τούτων δ᾽ ὅσαι μὲν ὁμωνύμως λέγονται δυνάμεις ἀφείσθωσαν ἔνιαι γὰρ ὁμοιότητί τινι λέγονται, καθάπερ ἐν γεωμετρίᾳ καὶ δυνατὰ καὶ ἀδύνατα λέγομεν τῷ εἶναί πως ἢ μὴ εἶναι, ὅσαι δὲ πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ εἶδος, πᾶσαι ἀρχαί τινές εἰσι, καὶ πρὸς πρώτην μίαν λέγονται, ἥ ἐστιν ἀρχὴ μεταβολῆς ἐν ἄλλῳ ἢ ᾗ ἄλλο. ἡ μὲν γὰρ τοῦ παθεῖν ἐστὶ δύναμις, ἡ ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ πάσχοντι ἀρχὴ μεταβολῆς παθητικῆς ὑπ᾽ ἄλλου ἢ ᾗ ἄλλο· ἡ δ᾽ ἕξις ἀπαθείας τῆς ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον καὶ φθορᾶς τῆς ὑπ᾽ ἄλλου ἢ ᾗ ἄλλο ὑπ᾽ ἀρχῆς μεταβλητικῆς	i mean the difficulty that it is impossible to define what a thing is ( for the definition, they say, is a lengthy formula ), but it is possible actually to teach others what a thing is like; e. g., we cannot say what silver is, but we can say that it is like tin. hence there can be definition and formula of one kind of substance, i. e. the composite, whether it is sensible or intelligible; but not of its primary constituents, since the defining
καὶ ὑπὲρ σοῦ δέ, εἴ με ἐῴης, ταὐτὰ ἂν ταῦτα ἀποκρινοίμην, ὅτι ἤτοι ταὐτόν γ’ ἐστιν δικαιότης ὁσιότητι ἢ ὅτι ὁμοιότατον, καὶ μάλιστα πάντων ἥ τε δικαιοσύνη οἷον ὁσιότης καὶ ἡ ὁσιότης οἷον δικαιοσύνη.	since justness is either the same thing as holiness or extremely like it, and above all, justice is of the same kind as holiness, and holiness as justice.
Μελάμπους δὲ ὑπέσχετο, καὶ προεῖπεν ὅτι φωραθήσεται κλέπτων καὶ δεθεὶς ἐνιαυτὸν οὕτω τὰς βόας λήψεται.	Melampus promised to do so, and foretold that he should be detected in the act of stealing them, and that he should get the kine after being kept in bondage for a year.
οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῦ Κράτητος τοῦτ’ αὐτὸν εἰπεῖν·	But others attribute this saying of his to the time when he was under Crates.
κρίνει δ᾽ ἡ περὶ ἕκαστον ἀρετὴ τὸ μεῖζον καὶ τὸ ἔλαττον ὀρθῶς, ἅπερ ὁ φρόνιμος ἂν κελεύσειε καὶ ἡ ἀρετή, ὥστε ἕπεσθαι αὐτῇ πάσας τὰς ἀρετάς, ἢ αὐτὴν ἕπεσθαι πάσαις.	and the virtue concerned with each thing judges rightly the greater and the smaller good, just as the wise man and virtue would bid, so that all the virtues go with it, or it goes with all the virtues.
εἰ δὲ μή, ἐπ’ αὐτοφώρῳ ἐγὼ αὐτὸν ἐξελέγξω.	failing that, I shall convict him as taken in the act.
εἶπεν δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ Ἐγὼ Φαραώ· ἄνευ σοῦ οὐκ ἐξαρεῖ οὐθεὶς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου.	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you no one lifts his hand over all the land of Egypt.”
Ἑρμοῦ τε ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ ναὸν ἱδρύσασθαι καὶ θῦσαι τῷ θεῷ Πέλοπα ἔλεγον οἱ Ἠλεῖοι πρῶτον, ἀποτρεπόμενον τὸ ἐπὶ τῷ Μυρτίλου θανάτῳ μήνιμα ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ.	The Eleans said that Pelops was the first to found a temple of' Hermes in Peloponnesus and to sacrifice to the god, his purpose being to avert the wrath of the god for the death of Myrtilus.
κἀν τούτῳ οὐδὲ καταλύεσθαι ἔτι καλόν, ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ δόξομεν ἄρξαι μᾶλλον τῆς διαφορᾶς.	Meanwhile our honor will be pledged to keeping on, particularly if it be the opinion that we began the quarrel.
ἦν γάρ, ἔφη, καὶ ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ δόξα περὶ τὸν τοιοῦτον.	That was and is our belief about this type.
ἀγάλματα δὲ ὀρθὰ Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Ἀρτέμιδός ἐστιν.	There are also standing images of Apollo and Artemis.
ὁπόταν γὰρ ἀριθμῶν τριῶν εἴτε ὄγκων εἴτε δυνάμεων ὡντινωνοῦν ᾖ τὸ μέσον, ὅτιπερ τὸ πρῶτον πρὸς αὐτό, τοῦτο αὐτὸ πρὸς τὸ ἔσχατον, καὶ πάλιν αὖθις, ὅτι τὸ ἔσχατον πρὸς τὸ μέσον, τὸ μέσον πρὸς τὸ πρῶτον, τότε τὸ μέσον μὲν πρῶτον καὶ ἔσχατον γιγνόμενον, τὸ δ’ ἔσχατον καὶ τὸ πρῶτον αὖ μέσα ἀμφότερα, πάνθ’ οὕτως ἐξ ἀνάγκης τὰ αὐτὰ εἶναι συμβήσεται, τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ γενόμενα ἀλλήλοις ἓν πάντα ἔσται.	For whenever the middle term of any three numbers, cubic or square, is such that as the first term is to it, so is it to the last term, and again, conversely, as the last term is to the middle, so is the middle to the first,—then the middle term becomes in turn the first and the last, while the first and last become in turn middle terms, and the necessary consequence will be that all the terms are interchangeable, and being interchangeable they all form a unity.
Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μὲ λέγων	Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
οὐ μὴν τά γε ἐς τοὺς γονέας αὐτῆς οὐδὲ τῷ συνῴκησεν ἔχω λέγειν. ἰόντων δὲ ὡς ἐπὶ Κυπαρισσιὰς ἀπὸ Ἀνδανίας Πολίχνη τέ ἐστι καλουμένη καὶ ποταμὸς Ἠλέκτρα καὶ Κοῖος ῥέουσι·	On the road from Andania towards Cyparissiae is Polichne, as it is called, and the streams of Electra and Coeus.
πόσοις δ’ ἂν λόγοις ἐξεγένετο χρήσασθαι περὶ τὴν φρόνησιν τοῦ σοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τὴν ἐν ταῖς συμφοραῖς διοίκησιν καὶ τὴν μάχην τὴν ἐν τῇ πόλει γενομένην ἧς ἡγεμὼν σὺ καταστὰς καὶ μετ’ ὀλίγων πρὸς πολλοὺς κινδυνεύσας καὶ πάντων διενεγκὼν αἴτιος ἐγένου τῇ πόλει τῆς σωτηρίας, οὗ κάλλιον ἔργον οὐδεὶς ἂν ἐπιδείξειεν;	How long a story would be needed to tell of your father's wisdom, of his handling of affairs in adversity, and of that battle in Sparta in which you, leading a few against many, exposed yourself to danger, and, surpassing all, proved to be the author of your city's salvation—a deed than which no man could point to one more glorious!
ἐπεκλήθη δὲ Δώσων ὡς ἐπαγγελτικὸς, οὐ τελεσιουργὸς δὲ τῶν ὑποσχέσεων.	He received the surname of Doson, which implied that he was given to promising but did not perform his engagements.
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱερεῖς σαλπιοῦσιν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν, καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν νόμιμον αἰώνιον εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν.	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, will signal with the trumpets, and it will be for you a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations.
καίτοι πολλῷ πλείων ἐστὶ σπουδὴ πρὸς τοὺς παρόντας·	To be sure, one is far more earnest towards men in their presence
οὐχ ἵνα τοῖς βαρβάροις μόνον τοῖς ἐπὶ τῆς Εὐρώπης κατοικοῦσι πολεμῶν διατελῇς, ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἂν ἐν τούτοις γυμνασθεὶς καὶ λαβὼν ἐμπειρίαν καὶ γνωσθεὶς οἷος εἶ τούτων ἐπιθυμήσῃς ὧν ἐγὼ τυγχάνω συμβεβουλευκώς.	and I believe he did so, not that you might spend your whole life warring upon the barbarians in Europe alone, but that, having been trained and having gained experience and come to know your own powers in these campaigns, you might set your heart upon the course which I have urged upon you.
ἀλλ’ εἴπερ ἡ αἰτία πρός τι, τοῦ γὰρ ὑπ’ αὐτῆς γενομένου μόνου, τῶν δ’ ἄλλων οὐδενός, εὔδηλον, ὅτι καὶ ἡ δύναμις ἐν τῷ πρός τι.	But, if the cause is relative to something- for it is the cause of what results from it, and of nothing else- it is obvious that the faculty also falls into the category of the relative
ἀναβλέψατε εἰς ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν καὶ ἴδετε· τίς κατέδειξεν πάντα ταῦτα; ὁ ἐκφέρων κατ᾽ ἀριθμὸν τὸν κόσμον αὐτοῦ, πάντας ἐπ᾽ ὀνόματι καλέσει ἀπὸ πολλῆς δόξης, καὶ ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος οὐδέν σε ἔλαθεν.	Lift up your eyes to the height and see; who has brought all these things to light? The one who brings forth his array by number will call them all by name by means of great glory; and by the might of his power nothing ⌊has escaped your notice⌋.
βίᾳ δὴ καὶ οὗτος ἄρχων τῶν ἐν αὑτῷ ἡδονῶν, ὅσαι ἀναλωτικαὶ μέν, χρηματιστικαὶ δὲ μή· αἳ δὴ οὐκ ἀναγκαῖαι κέκληνται δῆλον, ἔφη.	And he, too, would control by force all his appetites for pleasure that are wasters and not winners of wealth, those which are denominated unnecessary. Obviously.
Καππαδοκίας δὲ πρὸ μὲν Μακεδόνων οἵτινες ἦρχον, οὐκ ἔχω σαφῶς εἰπεῖν, εἴτε ἰδίαν ἀρχήν, εἴτε Δαρείου κατήκουον·	Who were the rulers of Cappadocia before the Macedonians I am not able to say exactly -- whether it had a government of its own or was subject to Darius.
Τοῖς πράγμασιν γὰρ οὐχὶ θυμοῦσθαι χρεών˙ μέλει γὰρ αὐτοῖς οὐδέν.	It is not right to vex ourselves at things, for they care nought about it.
εἰ δὲ ἕτεραι ἀρχαί, μία μὲν ἀπορία πότερον ἄφθαρτοι καὶ αὗται ἔσονται ἢ φθαρταί· εἰ μὲν γὰρ φθαρταί, δῆλον ὡς ἀναγκαῖον καὶ ταύτας ἔκ τινων εἶναι πάντα γὰρ φθείρεται εἰς ταῦτ᾽ ἐξ ὧν ἔστιν, ὥστε συμβαίνει τῶν ἀρχῶν ἑτέρας ἀρχὰς εἶναι προτέρας, τοῦτο δ᾽ ἀδύνατον, καὶ εἰ ἵσταται καὶ εἰ βαδίζει εἰς ἄπειρον·	if however they are different, one difficulty is whether they too are to be regarded as imperishable or as perishable. for if they are perishable, it is clearly necessary that they too must be derived from something else, since everything passes upon dissolution into that from which it is derived. hence it follows that there are other principles prior to the first principles; but this is impossible, whether the series stops or proceeds to infinity.
Δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις θεῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς εἰρήνη, ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία. αἰνοῦμέν σε.	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men. We praise you.
οὐκ ἀπέστη ἕως ἐνίκησεν σκορπίσαι ὡς ἐν ὀρφανίᾳ, καὶ ἠρήμωσεν οἶκον ἕνεκεν ἐπιθυμίας παρανόμου.	He did not stop until he prevailed to scatter as in orphanhood. And he desolated a house because of lawless desire.
Γεγόνασι δὲ Βίωνες δέκα·	Ten men have borne the name of Bion
τιθήνησον τέκνον καὶ ἐκθαμβήσει σε, σύνπαιξον αὐτῷ καὶ λυπήσει σε.	Pamper a child, and he will astonish you; play with him, and he will grieve you.
ἢν δὲ ἐκπέσωσι ἔνθεν, ἄπονοί τε γίγνονται, οὐδ’ ὄναρ ἀπηλλάχθαι δοκέειν τοῦ πόνου εἰθισμένοι ·	But if the stones drop out, the patients become free from pain, which they have not been accustomed to be, not even in their dreams
εἶπεν δὲ Ἰούδας Ἐχέτω αὐτά, ἀλλὰ μή ποτε καταγελασθῶμεν· ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπέσταλκα τὸν ἔριφον τοῦτον, σὺ δὲ οὐχ εὕρηκας.	Judah said, “Let her have them, but let us not be derided. I have sent this kid, but you have not found her.”
καὶ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Ἀβρὰμ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Ἀβρὰμ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίῳ τῷ ὀφθέντι αὐτῷ.	And the Lord was seen by Abram and said to him, “To your seed I will give this land.” And Abram built an altar there to the Lord, who was seen by him.
γέγονε μὲν δὴ ἢ ἔστι τὸ συμβεβηκός, ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ᾗ αὐτὸ ἀλλ᾽ ᾗ ἕτερον·	the accident has happened or exists, but in virtue not of itself but of something else;
τὸν ἁλάδρομον ἁλάμενος ἅμ᾽ ἀνεμων πνοαῖσι βαίην.	as i soar over the seas, carried by the breath of the winds... "
ἆρ’ οἰόμεθ’ ἂν αὐτούς, ὦ Πρωταγόρα, ἄλλο τι ἀποκρίνασθαι ἢ ὅτι οὐ κατὰ τὴν αὐτῆς τῆς ἡδονῆς τῆς παραχρῆμα ἐργασίαν κακά ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὰ ὕστερον γιγνόμενα, νόσους τε καὶ τἆλλα.	Can we suppose, Protagoras, that they will make any other answer than that these things are evil, not according to the operation of the actual pleasure of the moment, but owing to the later results in disease and those other ills?
ὁπόταν ἡ τῶν εἰσιόντων σύστασις ἐν ὑγροῖς, οἰκεία τῇ τῆς γλώττης ἕξει πεφυκυῖα, λεαίνῃ μὲν ἐπαλείφουσα τὰ τραχυνθέντα, τὰ δὲ παρὰ φύσιν συνεστῶτα ἢ κεχυμένα τὰ μὲν συνάγῃ, τὰ δὲ χαλᾷ, καὶ πάνθ’ ὅτι μάλιστα ἱδρύῃ κατὰ φύσιν, ἡδὺ καὶ προσφιλὲς παντὶ πᾶν τὸ τοιοῦτον ἴαμα τῶν βιαίων παθημάτων γιγνόμενον κέκληται γλυκύ.	and those formed of pure moisture are the transparent globules called by the name of bubbles, while those of the earthy formation which moves throughout its mass and seethes are designated boiling and fermenting
πῶς οὖν οἰκοδομηθήσεται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου, μάθετε.	Learn then how it will be built in the name of the Lord.
Καὶ εἶπεν Μαριάμ, Μεγαλύνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν κύριον	And Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord"
τούτῳ μέν γε καινὸν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ δεινόν, ἐὰν ἁλῶ, συμβήσεται·	It will be no new or alarming experience for the defendant if he is convicted, for he has committed in the past many other crimes meriting the death penalty and has spent more time in prison than out of it.
καὶ ὁ μὲν ὡς ἐς τὸ τέρμα ἦλθε τοῦ βαράθρου, κατεκλίθη τε καὶ ἐφελκυσάμενος τὴν χλαμύδα ἀνέμενεν ὡς πάντως οἱ ἀποθανεῖν πεπρωμένον·	For when he came to the bottom of the chasm he lay down, and covering himself with his cloak awaited the death that fate had surely decreed.
γιγνώσκω μὲν οὖν ὅτι τοῖς πλείστοις τῶν νουθετουμένων ἔμφυτόν ἐστι μὴ πρὸς τὰς ὠφελείας ἀποβλέπειν, ἀλλὰ τοσούτῳ χαλεπώτερον ἀκούειν τῶν λεγομένων, ὅσῳ περ ἂν αὐτῶν τις ἀκριβέστερον ἐξετάζῃ τὰς ἁμαρτίας·	I am well aware, however, that it is instinctive with most persons when admonished, not to look to the benefits they receive but, on the contrary, to listen to what is said with the greater displeasure in proportion to the rigor with which their critic passes their faults in review.
τίνι χρὴ κρίνεσθαι τὰ μέλλοντα καλῶς κριθήσεσθαι;	By what are things to be judged, if they are to be judged rightly?
ταύτην προτέραν ξύνδησον, ὁτιὴ καὶ λαλεῖ.	bind that minx there who talks so prettily.
ἦ καὶ περὶ ἵππους οὕτω σοι δοκεῖ ἔχειν; οἱ μὲν βελτίους ποιοῦντες αὐτοὺς πάντες ἄνθρωποι εἶναι, εἷς δέ τις ὁ διαφθείρων;	does it seem to you to be so in the case of horses, that those who make them better are all mankind, and he who injures them some one person?
αγατηον φρ. 7 ὥσπερ καὶ τὸν Χείρωνα μυθολογοῦσιν οἱ ποιηταὶ διὰ τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἕλκους ὀδύνην εὔξασθαι ἀποθανεῖν ἀθάνατον ὄντα.	agathon fr. 7 as also cheiron, in the legendary story of the poets, because of the pain from his wound prayed that though immortal he might die.
καὶ ἐλέγετε Ἰδοὺ ἔδειξεν Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἠκούσαμεν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἴδομεν ὅτι λαλήσει θεὸς πρὸς ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ζήσεται.	and you said, ‘Look! The Lord our God showed his glory, and we heard his voice from the midst of the fire. On this day we saw that God will speak to a man, and he will live.
καὶ ἐκρατήσαμεν πασῶν τῶν πόλεων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, οὐκ ἦν πόλις ἣν οὐκ ἐλάβομεν παρ᾽ αὐτῶν· ἑξήκοντα πόλεις, πάντα τὰ συνκυροῦντα περίχωρα Ἀργὸβ βασιλέως Ὢγ ἐν Βασάν·	And we conquered all his cities at that time. There was not a city that we did not take from them, sixty cities in all the surrounding countries bordering Argob of Og, king in Bashan.
Μηδὲ κληθῆτε καθηγηταί· εἷς γὰρ ὑμῶν ἐστιν ὁ καθηγητής, ὁ χριστός.	"And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.
ὅσοι δὲ φθόνῳ καὶ διαβολῇ χρώμενοι ὑμᾶς ἀνέπειθον οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ πεπεισμένοι ἄλλους πείθοντες οὗτοι πάντες ἀπορώτατοί εἰσιν·	And all those who persuaded you by means of envy and slander—and some also persuaded others because they had been themselves persuaded—all these are most difficult to cope with
τοῦ δ’, εἰ καὶ μικρὰ πρὸς τὴν ἱκετείαν ἐνέδωκεν, ἀγαστὴ μὲν ἡ παρασκευὴ τοῦ φαρμάκου καὶ τήρησις, ἀγαστὴ δ’ ἡ χρῆσις, ὅτι τοῦ θεοῦ μὴ παρασχόντος αὐτῷ τὴν ἀσυλίαν, ὥσπερ ἐπὶ μείζονα βωμὸν καταφυγών, ἐκ τῶν ὅπλων καὶ τῶν δορυφόρων λαβὼν ἑαυτὸν ᾤχετο, τῆς Ἀντιπάτρου καταγελάσας ὠμότητος.	whereas in that of the other, even though it had a slight touch of supplication, we must admire the preparation of the poison and its place of custody, must admire, too, the use he made of it, because, since the god would not afford him asylum, he took refuge at a greater altar, as it were, made his escape from arms and mercenaries, and laughed to scorn the cruelty of Antipater.
λέγουσι δὲ καὶ ὅσοι Τεγεάτου τῶν παίδων ἐλείποντο, μετοικῆσαι σφᾶς ἑκουσίως ἐς Κρήτην, Κύδωνα καὶ Ἀρχήδιον καὶ Γόρτυνα· καὶ ἀπὸ τούτων φασὶν ὀνομασθῆναι τὰς πόλεις Κυδωνίαν καὶ Γόρτυνά τε καὶ Κατρέα. Κρῆτες δὲ οὐχ ὁμολογοῦντες τῷ Τεγεατῶν λόγῳ Κύδωνα μὲν Ἀκακαλλίδος θυγατρὸς Μίνω καὶ Ἑρμοῦ, Κατρέα δέ φασιν εἶναι Μίνω, τὸν δὲ Γόρτυνα Ῥαδαμάνθυος.	It is also said that all the surviving sons of Tegeates, namely, Cydon, Archedius and Gortys, migrated of their own free will to Crete, and that after them were named the cities Cydonia, Gortyna and Catreus. The Cretans dissent from the account of the Tegeans, saying that Cydon was a son of Hermes and of Acacallis, daughter of Minos, that Catreus was a son of Minos, and Gortys a son of Rhadamanthys.
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ὅσοι ἐξ ἄστεώς ἐστε, σκέψασθε ὅτι ὑπὸ τούτων οὕτω σφόδρα ἤρχεσθε, ὥστε ἀδελφοῖς καὶ ὑέσι καὶ πολίταις ἠναγκάζεσθε πολεμεῖν τοιοῦτον πόλεμον, ἐν ᾧ ἡττηθέντες μὲν τοῖς νικήσασι τὸ ἴσον ἔχετε, νικήσαντες δ’ ἄν τούτοις ἐδουλεύετε.	In the first place, all you of the town party should consider that you were so oppressed by the rule of these men that you were compelled to wage against your brothers, your sons and your fellow-citizens a strange warfare in which your defeat has given you equal rights with the victors, whereas your victory would have made you the slaves of these men.
καὶ τοὺς διδασκάλους τὰ διδασκαλεῖα καὶ τοὺς παιδοτρίβας τὰς παλαίστρας ἀνοίγειν μὲν ἀπαγορεύει μὴ πρότερον πρὶν ἂν ἥλιος ἀνίσχῃ, κλῄειν δὲ προστάττει πρὸ ἡλίου δεδυκότος, τὰς ἐρημίας καὶ τὸ σκότος ἐν πλείστῃ ὑποψίᾳ ποιούμενος·	He forbids the teacher to open the school-room, or the gymnastic trainer the wrestling school, before sunrise, and he commands them to close the doors before sunset for he is exceeding suspicious of their being alone with a boy, or in the dark with him. He prescribes what children are to be admitted as, pupils, and their age at admission.
καὶ ταῦθ’ ὡς οὐ δι’ ἀπορίαν ἐγίγνετο, ἀλλ’ ἵνα πιστευθείην ὑπ’ ἐκείνων, ῥᾳδίως γνώσεσθε. πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ὑμῖν μάρτυρας παρέξομαι τοὺς εἰδότας πολλά μοι χρήματ’ ἐκ τοῦ Πόντου κομισθέντα, ἔπειτα δὲ τοὺς ὁρῶντάς με τῇ τούτου τραπέζῃ χρώμενον, ἔτι δὲ παρ’ ὧν ἐχρυσώνησ’ ὑπ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον πλέον ἢ χιλίους στατῆρας.	And that these things were done by me, not because of lack of funds, but that the parties in Pontus might believe that to be the case, you will readily learn. I will present to you first those who knew that I had received much money from Pontus; next, those who saw me as a patron of Pasion's bank, and, besides, the persons from whom at that time I bought more than a thousand gold staters.
ἀλάλαξον, Ἑσεβών, ὅτι ὤλετο· κεκράξατε θυγατέρες Ῥαββάθ, περιζώσασθε σάκκους καὶ κόψασθε, ὅτι Μελχὸλ ἐν ἀποικίᾳ βαδιεῖται, οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ ἅμα.	Raise the war cry, Heshbon, because it is destroyed! Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Gird on sackcloth and beat your breast, because Melchol will go into captivity, his priests and his commanders together.
τί δέ σοι πολλὰ λέγω;	But why do I say much to you?
Ἴων δὲ ὁ Χῖος ἐν τοῖς Τριαγμοῖς φησιν αὐτὸν ἔνια ποιήσαντα ἀνενεγκεῖν εἰς Ὀρφέα.	According to Ion of Chios in his Triagmi he ascribed some poems of his own making to Orpheus.
καὶ νῦν εἰ μικρὰ ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν τῆς κατασχέσεως ὑμῶν, διάβητε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς κατασχέσεως Κυρίου οὗ κατασκηνοῖ ἐκεῖ ἡ σκηνὴ Κυρίου, καὶ κατακληρονομήσετε ἐν ἡμῖν· καὶ μὴ ἀποστάται ἀπὸ θεοῦ γενήθητε, καὶ μὴ ἀπόστητε ἀπὸ Κυρίου διὰ τὸ οἰκοδομῆσαι ὑμᾶς βωμὸν ἔξω τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν.	And now, if the land of your possession is too small, cross over to the land of the Lord’s possession there where the tent of the Lord resides, and you will give an inheritance among us; and do not become rebels from God and do not depart from the Lord by building your altar separate from the altar of the Lord our God.

Μοῖσα, τὸ δὲ τεόν, εἰ μισθοῖο συνέθευ παρέχειν φωνὰν ὑπάργυρον, ἄλλοτ’ ἄλλᾳ ταρασσέμεν ἢ πατρὶ Πυθονίκῳ τό γέ νυν ἢ Θρασυδαίῳ·	Muse, it is your task, if you undertook to lend your voice for silver, to let it flit now this way, now that
εἰ δὲ μή, διὰ τὸ ἀδύνατον εἶναι εἰπεῖν τὸ σιμὸν ἄνευ τοῦ πράγματος οὗ ἐστὶ πάθος καθ᾽ αὑτό ἔστι γὰρ τὸ σιμὸν κοιλότης ἐν ῥινί, τὸ ῥῖνα σιμὴν εἰπεῖν ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν ἢ δὶς τὸ αὐτὸ ἔσται εἰρημένον, ῥὶς ῥὶς κοίλη ἡ γὰρ ῥὶς ἡ σιμὴ ῥὶς ῥὶς κοίλη ἔσται, διὸ ἄτοπον τὸ ὑπάρχειν τοῖς τοιούτοις τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι· εἰ δὲ μή, εἰς ἄπειρον εἶσιν·	or instead of a simple formula one more exact - but no definition, nor essence. or perhaps " definition," like the " what," has more than one sense. for the " what " in one sense means the substance and the individual, and in another each one of the categories:
Αὗται αἱ διαιρέσεις ἃς κατεκληρονόμησεν Ἐλεαζὰρ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυὴ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ κλήρους ἐν Σηλὼ ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐμβατεῦσαι τὴν γῆν.	These are the divisions that Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders of the families gave as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel according to their shares at Shiloh before the Lord, before the doors of the tent of the testimony. And they proceeded to come into possession of the land.

εἴτε καὶ σπουδῇ τὸν οἰωνὸν οἰκειούμενος, εἴτε καὶ σπουδῇ τὸν οἰωνὸν οἰκειούμενος, ἦν γὰρ καὶ παρ’ αὐτῷ τις ἄνθρωπος ἄλλως μὲν εὐκαταφρόνητος καὶ παρημελημένος, οἰκίας δὲ τῆς Ἀφρικανῶν Σκηπίων ἐκαλεῖτο Σαλλουστίων, τοῦτον ἐν ταῖς μάχαις προέταττεν ὥσπερ ἡγεμόνα τῆς στρατιᾶς, ἀναγκαζόμενος πολλάκις ἐξάπτεσθαι Τῶν πολεμίων καὶ φιλομαχεῖν.	or else tried in good earnest to appropriate to himself the omen, it is hard to say which. He had under him, namely, a man who otherwise was a contemptible nobody, but belonged to the family of the Africani, and was called Scipio Sallustio. This man Caesar put in the forefront of his battles as if commander of the army, being compelled to attack the enemy frequently and to force the fighting.
τίκτει γὰρ κόρος ὕβριν, ὅταν πολὺς ὄλβος ἕπηται ἀνθρώποισιν, ὅσοις μὴ νόος ἄρτιος ᾖ.	satiety breeds insolence when riches attend the men whose mind is not prepared.
Ὡς δὲ κατέβαινεν Μωυσῆς ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ αἱ δύο πλάκες ἐπὶ τῶν χειρῶν Μωυσῆ· καταβαίνοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, Μωσῆς οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι δεδόξασται ἡ ὄψις τοῦ χρώματος τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν αὐτὸν αὐτῷ.	And as Moses came down out of the mountain, the two tablets were in the hands of Moses. But as he descended from the mountain, Moses did not know that the appearance of the skin of his face began to glow when he spoke to him.
παραγίνεσθαι γὰρ εἰς Λεῦκτρα Λακεδαιμονίους, αὐτῷ τε καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσι δώσοντας δίκας·	only the ghost advised him, the day before he encountered the Lacedaemonians, to sacrifice a white colt, which he should find ready for him close by his daughters’ sepulchre.

γράφων τε ταῦτα συνεχῶς ἐς Καρχηδόνα, καὶ προστιθεὶς ὅτι Ῥωμαῖοι κρύφα τὴν Ἰβηρίαν αὐτῶν ἀφιστᾶσιν, ἔτυχε παρὰ Καρχηδονίων πράσσειν ὅ τι δοκιμάσειεν.	By continually forwarding these accusations to Carthage, and by accusing the Romans of secretly inciting the Spaniards to revolt, he obtained permission from Carthage to take such steps as he should think fit.
ὡς δὲ ὅ τε λιμὸς αὐτοὺς καθῄρει καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία καὶ ὁ φόβος καὶ ὁ πόνος, τοῦ κακοῦ προσπελάζοντος, τὸ μὲν τέμενος ἐξέλιπον, ἐς δὲ τὸν νεὼν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ τέγος ἀνέτρεχον.	But, finally, overcome by hunger, want of sleep, fear, toil, and approaching dissolution, they abandoned the enclosures of the temple and fled to the shrine and roof.
Καθ' ἡμέραν τε προσκαρτεροῦντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, κλῶντές τε κατ' οἶκον ἄρτον, μετελάμβανον τροφῆς ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας,	So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
Πίστει καὶ αὐτὴ Σάρρα δύναμιν εἰς καταβολὴν σπέρματος ἔλαβεν, καὶ παρὰ καιρὸν ἡλικίας ἔτεκεν, ἐπεὶ πιστὸν ἡγήσατο τὸν ἐπαγγειλάμενον.	By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised.
συνεῖσι δὲ τῆς χάριτος ὑμῖν τοσοῦτον ἂν ἐπείποιμι, ὅτι μηδενὸς ἁμαρτήματος ἴσον ἐπιτίμιον ὁρίζεται. ”	As you are sensible of our leniency toward you, I will merely add that the penalty imposed is by no means equal to your deserts."

ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ Πείσωνος τὸ σῶμα φέροντος ἐς τὴν ἀγορὰν πλῆθός τε ἄπειρον ἐς φρουρὰν συνέδραμον σὺν ὅπλοις, καὶ μετὰ βοῆς καὶ πομπῆς δαψιλοῦς ἐπὶ τὰ ἔμβολα προυτέθη, οἰμωγή τε καὶ θρῆνος ἦν αὖθις ἐπὶ πλεῖστον, καὶ τὰ ὅπλα ἐπατάγουν οἱ ὡπλισμένοι καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν ἐν μετανοίᾳ τῆς ἀμνηστίας ἐγίγνοντο.	Wailing and lamentation were renewed for a long time, the armed men clashed their shields, and gradually they began to repent themselves of the amnesty.
ἔτι δὲ καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων πολλοὺς ἂν ἴδοις ἐκεῖ κατοικοῦντας, οὐκ ἀδόξους ἄνδρας οὐδ’ ἀνοήτους, ἀλλ’ οἷς ἐκεῖνος ἀνακοινούμενος οὐκ ἐλάττω τὴν βασιλείαν πεποίηκεν ἀλλ’ εὐχῆς ἄξια διαπέπρακται.	Furthermore, you will find that there are many Hellenes living in his country, who are not unknown to fame or lacking in intelligence, but men by sharing whose counsel he has not diminished his kingdom but has, on the contrary, accomplished deeds which match his dreams.
καὶ Σίμων ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Ἁδιδὰ ἐν τῇ σεφηλά, καὶ ὠχύρωσεν θύρας καὶ μοχλούς.	And Simon built up Adida in the Shephelah, and he fortified gates and bars.
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐγὼ προσελθὼν ἐξῄτουν αὐτόν, ἡγούμενος ἔλεγχον ἂν τοῦτον σαφέστατον γενέσθαι περὶ ὧν ἐνεκάλουν, λέγει λόγον πάντων δεινότατον, ὡς ἐγὼ καὶ Μενέξενος διαφθείραντες καὶ πείσαντες αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῇ τραπέζῃ καθήμενον ἓξ τάλαντ’ ἀργυρίου λάβοιμεν παρ’ αὐτοῦ·	And when I went to him and demanded the surrender of Cittus, because I believed that this slave could furnish the clearest proof of my claim, Pasion made the most outrageous charge, that I and Menexenus had bribed and corrupted Cittus as he sat at his banking-table and received six talents of silver from him.

ξυντετάρακται δ᾽ αἰθὴρ πόντῳ.	the sky is confounded with the deep.
καὶ λαβών τις αὐτὰ περιδύσας τὸ μέτρον ὃ νῦν ἔχει, εἷμα δοὺς καὶ πορφυροῦν λόγοισι ποικίλας καλοῖς δυσπάλαιστος ὢν τὸς ἄλλως εὐπαλαίστους ἀποφανεῖ.	some one will take them and free them from the metre in which they are now set, nay, will give them instead a purple robe, embroidering it with fine phrases and, being invincible, he will make every one else an easy prey.
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν τούτοις προσεῖχον τὸν νοῦν, κατέστησα δὲ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι, εἴ τι δέοι τῷ χορῷ, Φανόστρατον, δημότην μὲν τουτωνὶ τῶν διωκόντων, κηδεστὴν δ᾽ ἐμαυτοῦ, ᾧ ἐγὼ δέδωκα τὴν θυγατέρα, καὶ ἠξίουν αὐτὸν ὡς	just as though nothing could have been more satisfactory or better suited to both parties, i on my side would make my demand or request, while the parents on theirs would send their sons along without demur, nay, readily.
διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπεν Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα Οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῷ καθήμενος ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυείδ, καὶ τὸ θνησιμαῖον αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἐριμμένον ἐν τῷ καύματι τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ ἐν τῷ παγετῷ τῆς νυκτός.	⌊Therefore⌋ this is what the Lord said against Jehoiakim, king of Judah: “⌊He will not have anyone to sit upon the throne of David⌋, and his carcass will be discarded in the heat of the day and in the frost of the night.
αἱ μὲν οὖν δαπάναι τῶν μὲν τοιούτων οὐδὲν ἐξεργάζονται, τοῦ δὲ πλούτου σημεῖόν εἰσιν·	Expenditure of money can effect nothing of this kind, but is an indication of wealth only

οὐ κατελείφθη τῶν Ἐνακεὶμ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἀλλὰ πλὴν ἐν Γάζῃ καὶ ἐν Ἀσελδὼ κατελείφθη.	Not one of the Anakim was left behind from the children of Israel, but only in Gaza and in Ashdod were they left behind.
ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν μελετήσει φόβον· ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ γραμματικοί; ⸂⸆⸃ ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ συμβουλεύοντες; ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ ἀριθμῶν τοὺς τρεφομένους	Our soul will think about fear: Where are the scholars? Where are the advisors? Where is the one who numbers those who grow up,
Τούτους τοὺς δώδεκα ἀπέστειλεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς, παραγγείλας αὐτοῖς, λέγων, Εἰς ὁδὸν ἐθνῶν μὴ ἀπέλθητε, καὶ εἰς πόλιν Σαμαρειτῶν μὴ εἰσέλθητε·	These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.
ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται, καὶ αὕτη ἀποκαθαριεῖ πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν· οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ δικαιοσύνας πλησθήσονται ζωῆς·	Almsgiving delivers from death, and it will cleanse every sin. Those who practice almsgiving and righteousness will be filled with life.
τὴν δὲ δὴ τοῦ στόματος ἡμῶν δύναμιν ὀδοῦσιν καὶ γλώττῃ καὶ χείλεσιν ἕνεκα τῶν ἀναγκαίων καὶ τῶν ἀρίστων διεκόσμησαν οἱ διακοσμοῦντες ᾗ νῦν διατέτακται, τὴν μὲν εἴσοδον τῶν ἀναγκαίων μηχανώμενοι χάριν, τὴν δ’ ἔξοδον τῶν ἀρίστων·	And those who fashioned the features of our mouth fashioned it with teeth and tongue and lips, even as it is fashioned now, for ends both necessary and most good, contriving it as an entrance with a view to necessary ends, and as an outlet with a view to the ends most good.
αὐτοὶ δὲ γυναικὸς ἐπιχωρίας ὄνομα εἶναι τὴν Ἐλάφιον καὶ ὑπὸ ταύτης τραφῆναι τὴν Ἄρτεμίν φασι.	But they themselves say that Elaphius was the name of a native woman by whom Artemis was reared.
ἢν δὲ φλεβοτομίην μὲν ἡ δύναμις ἀποτρέπῃ, φλεγμασίαι δὲ ἔωσι, σικύην τῇδε προσβάλλειν πολὺ πρόσθεν τῆς κρίσιος τοῦ νοσήματος.	But if the strength reject venesection, and inflammations be present, we must apply the cupping-instrument to the seat thereof a considerable time previous to the crisis of the disease
οἱ δὲ τὸν Κεκίναν αἰτιῶνται, σπεύδοντα τὴν νίκην ἑαυτοῦ γενέσθαι πρὶν ἐκεῖνον ἐλθεῖν, ἄλλοις τε μικροτέροις περιπεσεῖν ἁμαρτήμασι καὶ μάχην οὐ κατὰ καιρὸν οὐδὲ γενναίως συνάψαι, μικροῦ πάντα τὰ πράγματα διαφθείρασαν αὐτοῖς.	But some blame Caecina, who, they say, was eager to win the victory himself before Valens came, and so not only made other minor mistakes, but also joined battle inopportunely and without much spirit, thereby almost ruining their whole enterprise.
καὶ ἐπειδάν τις αὐτοὺς ἐρωτᾷ ὅτι ποιῶν καὶ ὅτι διδάσκων, ἔχουσι μὲν οὐδὲν εἰπεῖν ἀλλ’ ἀγνοοῦσιν, ἵνα δὲ μὴ δοκῶσιν ἀπορεῖν, τὰ κατὰ πάντων τῶν φιλοσοφούντων πρόχειρα ταῦτα λέγουσιν, ὅτι τὰ μετέωρα καὶ τὰ ὑπὸ γῆς καὶ θεοὺς μὴ νομίζειν καὶ τὸν ἥττω λόγον κρείττω ποιεῖν.	they have nothing to say, but they do not know, and that they may not seem to be at a loss they say these things that are handy to say against all the philosophers, the things in the air and the things beneath the earth and not to believe in the gods and to make the weaker argument the stronger.
“Μνημονευτέον δὲ ὡς τὸ μέλλον οὔτε ἡμέτερον οὔτε πάντως οὐχ ἡμέτερον, ἵνα μήτε πάντως προσμένωμεν ὡς ἐσόμενον μήτε ἀπελπίζωμεν ὡς πάντως οὐκ ἐσόμενον.	We must remember that the future is neither wholly ours nor wholly not ours, so that neither must we count upon it as quite certain to come nor despair of it as quite certain not to come.
οἳ δ᾽ ἐλελίχθησαν καὶ ἐναντίοι ἔσταν Ἀχαιῶν:	So they rallied, and took their stand with their faces toward the Achaeans,
ἄκρεα γὰρ ψυχρὰ, κεφαλὴ, πόδες τε, καὶ χεῖρες·	for the extremities are cold--the head, the feet, and the hands
νὴ τὼ θεὼ γνώσεσθ᾽ ἄρα ὅτι καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰσι τέτταρες λόχοι μαχίμων γυναικῶν ἔνδον ἐξωπλισμένων.	by the goddesses, you'll find that here await you four companies of most pugnacious women armed cap - a - pie from the topmost louring curl to the lowest angry dimple.
ὀγδόῳ ἔτει δοκιμασθέντος μετὰ ταῦτα τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου τοῖν μειρακίοιν, καλέσας αὐτοὺς εἶπε Διογείτων, ὅτι καταλίποι αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ εἴκοσι μνᾶς ἀργυρίου καὶ τριάκοντα στατῆρας.	Seven years later the elder of the boys was certified to be of age
Εὐκοπώτερον γάρ ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τρυμαλιᾶς ῥαφίδος εἰσελθεῖν, ἢ πλούσιον εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν.	"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
μήτε τοίνυν ταῦτα φοβοῦ καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ πολὺ τἀργύριόν ἐστιν ὃ θέλουσι λαβόντες τινὲς σῶσαί σε καὶ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐνθένδε.	Well, do not fear this! for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here.
σὺ τὸν ἀναριθμήτοις δυνάμεσιν γαυρωθέντα Σενναχηρεὶμ βαρὺν Ἀσσυρίων βασιλέα, δόρατι τὴν πᾶσαν ὑποχείριον ἤδη λαβόντα γῆν καὶ μετεωρισθέντα ἐπὶ τὴν ἁγίαν σου πόλιν, βαρέα λαλοῦντα κόμπῳ καὶ θράσει, σύ, δέσποτα, ἔθραυσας, ἔκδηλον δεικνὺς ἔθνεσιν πολλοῖς τὸ σὸν κράτος.	Sennacherib, cruel king of the Assyrians, who exalted himself with his innumerable forces, who had already taken the whole earth in his hand by the spear, and who was lifted up against your holy city, speaking grievously with boasting and arrogance, you, O Lord, shattered him, making your power manifest to many nations.
Λακεδαιμονίοις αὐτεπάγγελτοι βοηθήσοντες ἀφίκοντο ὑπὸ Πύρρου τοῦ Αἰακίδου πολεμουμένοις, καί σφισιν ἀπὸ τῆς εὐεργεσίας ταύτης ἤδη τὰ ἐκ τῆς Σπάρτης εἰρηνικώτερα ὑπῆρχεν.	When Pyrrhus the son of Aeacides made war on the Lacedaemonians, they came unasked to their assistance, and as a result of this service a more peaceful disposition towards them came to be established at Sparta.
ὅτι μὲν οὖν καὶ ἐν τῇ προτέρᾳ δίκῃ ἡ τούτου μαρτυρία ψευδὴς ἔδοξεν εἶναι, ὁ τόθ’ ἑαλωκὼς μάρτυς σαφέστατα τοῦτον ἐξελέγχει.	That in the former trial Nicodemus's evidence was recognized as being false, the condemnation of the witness on that occasion most clearly proves.
μεῖζον γὰρ ἦν ἀπόντος ὄνομα τοῦ Πομπηίου καί κράτος ἐν τῇ πόλει διὰ τὰς στρατείας·	For Pompey’s name and power were greater in the city when he was away from it, owing to his campaigns
μετὰ δικαιοσύνης πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματός μου, οὐδὲν ἐν αὐτοῖς σκολιὸν οὐδὲ στραγγαλῶδες·	All the words of my mouth are in with righteousness; nothing in them is crooked or twisted.
ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτοὺς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐπορεύθη Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἕως θαλάσσης Σείφ, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Καδής.	because when they came up from Egypt, Israel went in the wilderness up to the sea of Siph, and went into Kadesh.
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐκείνου τελευτὴν πρὸς μὲν τοὺς βαρβάρους οὐδὲν ἔτι λαμπρὸν ὑπ’ οὐδενὸς ἐπράχθη στρατηγοῦ τῶν Ἑλλήνων, ἀλλὰ τραπέντες ὑπὸ δημαγωγῶν καὶ πολεμοποιῶν ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους, οὐδενὸς τὰς χεῖρας ἐν μέσῳ διασχόντος, συνερράγησαν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ἀναπνοὴ μὲν τοῖς βασιλέως πράγμασι γενόμενοι, φθόρον δ’ ἀμύθητον τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς δυνάμεως ἀπεργασάμενοι.	After his death no further brilliant exploit against the Barbarians was performed by any general of the Hellenes, who were swayed by demagogues and partisans of civil war, with none to hold a mediating hand between them, till they actually clashed together in war. This afforded the cause of the King a respite, but brought to pass an indescribable destruction of Hellenic power.
οἱ δὲ εἶπαν Καὶ ζῇ καὶ ὑγιαίνει. καὶ εἶπεν Τωβίας Πατήρ μού ἐστιν.	And they replied, “He is both alive and well.” Then Tobias said, “He is my father.”
ἡνίκα ἐὰν ἐνκαταλίπητε Κύριον καὶ λατρεύσητε θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ ἐπελθὼν κακώσει ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐξαναλώσει ὑμᾶς ἀνθ᾽ ὧν εὖ ἐποίησεν ὑμᾶς.	When you abandon the Lord and serve other gods, then coming upon you, he will harm you and consume you instead of that good he did for you.”
καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ: Ἔσται οὕτως, ὡς ἐλάλησας ἡμῖν. ὡς ἐὰν οὖν γνῷς παραγινομένους ἡμᾶς, συνάξεις πάντας τοὺς σοὺς ὑπὸ τὸ στέγος σου, καὶ διασωθήσονται: ὅσοι γὰρ ἐὰν εὑρεθῶσιν ἔξω τῆς οἰκίας, ἀπολοῦνται.	And they said to her, It shall be as thou hast spoken to us; when therefore thou knowest that we are at hand, thou shalt gather all thy folk under thy roof, and they shall be safe; for as many as shall be found outside the house shall perish.
τοιαύτης δὲ τῷ Λυσάνδρῳ τῆς τελευτῆς γενομένης παραχρῆμα μὲν οὕτως ἤνεγκαν οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται βαρέως, ὥστε τῷ βασιλεῖ κρίσιν προγράψαι θανατικήν·	Now that Lysander had met with such an end, at the outset the Spartans were so indignant about it that they summoned the king to trial for his life
θρυπτομενου δὲ τοῦ Μαρίου καὶ παραιτεῖσθαι τὴν ἀρχὴν φάσκοντος ὡς δὴ μὴ δεομένου, προδότην αὐτὸν ὁ Σατορνῖνος ἀπεκάλει τῆς πατρίδος ἐν κινδύνῳ τοσούτῳ φεύγοντα τὸ στρατηγεῖν.	Marius affected to decline the office and declared that he did not want it, but Saturninus called him a traitor to his country for refusing to command her armies at a time of so great peril.
αὐτὰρ ὃ λάθρῃ ἔμβαλέ μοι ῥοιῆς κόκκον, μελιηδέ’ ἐδωδήν, ἄκουσαν δὲ βίῃ με προσηνάγκασσε πάσασθαι.	but he secretly put in my mouth sweet food, a pomegranate seed, and forced me to taste against my will.
ἡγοῦμαι δὲ Πασίων’, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, ἐκ τοῦ διεφθαρμένου γραμματείου τὴν ἀπολογίαν ποιήσεσθαι καὶ τοὺτοις ἰσχυριεῖσθαι μάλιστα.	But I think, men of the jury, that Pasion will base his defense on the falsified memorandum, and will especially rely on its contents.
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἰσχυρότερον τὸ δ’ ἀσθενέστερον ἐποίησεν,	For Providence made man stronger and woman weaker,
ἐχθὲς δ᾽ ἔχοντ᾽ εἶδόν σ᾽ ἐγὼ τριβώνιον.	yesterday i saw you with one utterly worn out.
πορευθέντες δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἤπειρον συναθροίζουσιν οἰκήτορας καὶ κτίζουσιν Ἀκαρνανίαν.	Then they journeyed to Epirus, collected settlers, and colonized Acarnania.
καὶ ἦν γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῇ Ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἠκούσθη ὅτι σὺ καὶ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι λογίζεσθε ἀποστατῆσαι· διὰ τοῦτο οἰκοδομεῖς τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς βασιλέα.	And in it was written, “It was heard among the nations that you and the Judeans are plotting to rebel. Because of this you are building the wall, and you will be their king.
καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τῆς κραυγῆς, καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι Τίς ἡ κραυγὴ ἡ μεγάλη αὕτη ἐν παρεμβολῇ τῶν Ἐβραίων; καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι κιβωτὸς Κυρίου ἥκει εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν.	And the Philistines heard the shouting, and the Philistines said, “What is this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” And they learned that the ark of the Lord was arriving in the camp.
ἀδικία δὲ ἀνδρὸς αἱ θύραζε συνουσίαι γιγνόμεναι.	And a man does wrong to his wife when he associates with other women.
καὶ ἐψώμισεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ στέατος πυροῦ, καὶ ἐκ πέτρας μέλι ἐχόρτασεν αὐτούς.	And he fed them from the fat of wheat, and from a rock of honey he satisfied them.
Πυθοκρίτῳ μὲν γέγονεν ἀντὶ τούτων ἡ ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ στήλη καὶ ἐπίγραμμα ἐπ’ αὐτῇ, Πυθοκρίτου τοῦ Καλλινίκου μνᾶμα ταὐλητᾶ τάδε·	It is also clear that at the Olympic Festival he fluted six times for the pentathlum. For these reasons the slab at Olympia was erected in honor of Pythocritus, with the inscription on it

But on their arrival in Sicily, when they perceived that Dion was slanderously charged before the Siceliots whom he had set free with plotting to become tyrant, they not only betrayed their companion and host but became themselves, so to say, the authors of his murder, since they stood beside the murderers, ready to assist, with arms in their hands.

Caesar was pleased with this speech, being altogether of the opinion that she desired to live.

νυνὶ δ’ ἀπιστίᾳ τοῦ μεγέθους οἱ βάρβαροι τῆς νίκης καὶ πρὸς εὐπάθειαν ἐκ τοῦ περιχαροῦς ἅμα καὶ νεμήσεις τῶν ἑαλωκότων ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ χρημάτων τραπόμενοι, τῷ μὲν ἐκπίπτοντι τῆς πόλεως ὄχλῳ ῥᾳστώνην φυγῆς παρέσχον, ἐλπίσαι δ’ ἔτι καὶ παρασκευάσασθαι τοῖς ὑπομένουσι τὴν γὰρ ἄλλην πόλιν προέμενοι τὸ Καπιτώλιον ἐφράξαντο βέλεσι καὶ διατειχίσμασιν.	But as it was, the Barbarians could not realize the magnitude of their victory, and in the excess of their joy, turned to revelry and the distribution of the good things captured in their enemy’s camp. For this reason the throngs who were for abandoning the city had ample time for flight, and those who were for remaining plucked up hope and prepared to defend themselves. Abandoning the rest of the city, they fenced the Capitol with ramparts and stocked it with missiles.
αὐτὸς γὰρ οὐ μικρὸν διήμαρτον διὰ ταύτην τὴν μεταβολὴν τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ πραγμάτων.	For I have myself, in my own affairs, suffered not a little from this change.
δρεπάνῳ γὰρ ἥτις ἂν τύχῃ τὴν φάρυγγα ὑπέτεμε τῆς βοός.	Whichever gets the chance cuts the throat of the cow with a sickle.
ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἔσται τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν τοῖς λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, καὶ ἔσται τοῖς ἐγγίζουσι λειτουργεῖν τῷ κυρίῳ· καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς τόπος εἰς οἴκους ἀφωρισμένους τῷ ἁγιασμῷ αὐτῶν,	Some of the land shall be for the priests ministering in the holy place, and it shall be for those who approach to minister to the Lord, and it shall be a place for them for their houses, separate for consecration,
οἷοι καὶ Διὸς Αἰγίνας τε λέκτρον ποιμένες ἀμφεπόλησαν Κυπρίας δώρων·	such loves,the shepherds of Cyprian Aphrodite’s gifts, attended the marriage-bed of Zeus and Aegina.
ὥστ’ οὐδὲ τούτους ἡγοῦμαι μετέχειν τῆς ἕξεως περὶ ἧς ἐγὼ τυγχάνω διαλεγόμενος.	So that I do not think that even these may be said to partake of the state of culture of which I am speaking.
ἰδοὺ δὴ Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐκβάλλει καὶ ἐκτρίψει ἄνδρα, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὴν στολήν σου καὶ τὸν στέφανόν σου τὸν ἔνδοξον,	Look now, the Lord Sabaoth casts out and will rub out a man, and he will take away your robe and your esteemed crown,
ὀλίγοι δὲ αὑτὸν ἐξέφυγον ἤδη προκατειλημμένοι καὶ διεφθαρμένοι παντάπασιν ὑπὸ τῶν Αἰτωλῶν, οὓς καίπερ ὀργισθεὶς καὶ παροξυνθεὶς ὅμως μετὰ τὴν μάχην περιεποίησεν. Ἀντίοχος γὰρ ἡττηθεὶς ἐν Θερμοπύλαις καὶ φυγὼν εὐθὺς εἰς Ἀσίαν ἀπέπλευσε, Μάνιος δ’ ὁ ὕπατος τοὺς μὲν αὐτὸς ἐπιὼν τῶν Αἰτωλῶν ἐπολιόρκει, τοὺς δὲ τῷ βασιλεῖ Φιλίππῳ συνεχώρησεν ἐξαιρεῖν.	A few, however, escaped his influence, having been already won over beforehand and totally corrupted by the Aetolians, but even these, in spite of his vexation and anger, were spared by him after the battle. For Antiochus was defeated at Thermopylae and put to flight, and at once sailed back to Asia; while Manius the consul went against some of the Aetolians himself and besieged them, leaving others to King Philip to destroy.
ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἄλλη Μεγαρεῦσιν ἀκρόπολις ἀπὸ Ἀλκάθου τὸ ὄνομα ἔχουσα·	The Megarians have another citadel, which is named after Alcathous.
καὶ γὰρ τούτου σφόδρ᾽ ἐρῶσιν.	this is their strongest passion.
ἀγαπήσατε τὸν κύριον, πάντες οἱ ὅσιοι αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἀληθείας ἐκζητεῖ Κύριος, καὶ ἀνταποδίδωσιν τοῖς περισσῶς ποιοῦσιν ὑπερηφανίαν.	Love the Lord, all his holy ones, because the Lord seeks out truths and repays to the ones who are making exceeding arrogance.
οὕνεκεν, εἰ φίλος ἀστῶν, εἴ τις ἀντάεις, τό γ’ ἐν ξυνῷ πεποναμένον εὖ μὴ λόγον βλάπτων ἁλίοιο γέροντος κρυπτέτω.	Therefore, whether a man is friendly or hostile among the citizens, let him not obscure a thing that is done well for the common good and so dishonor the precept of the old man of the sea, who said to praise with all your spirit, and with justice, even an enemy when he accomplishes fine deeds.
ἅμα δ’ ἡμέρᾳ πολὺ πλείονες ἐπηθροίζοντο, καὶ λέγονται τετρακισμυρίων οὐκ ἐλάττονες ἱππόται γενέσθαι, βασιλέως καὶ τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν ἀεὶ τεταγμένους ὡς ἐπὶ σαφεῖ καὶ βεβαίῳ κατορθώματι πέμψαντος·	At daybreak, too, they gathered for attack in far greater numbers, and there are said to have been no fewer than forty thousand horsemen, since their king had sent even those who were always arrayed about his person, assured that it was to manifest and assured success
μᾶλλον γὰρ ἐλπὶς τοὺς τοιούτους ἢ τοὺς ἱερεῖα πολλὰ καταβάλλοντας πράξειν τι παρὰ τῶν θεῶν ἀγαθόν.	for such men have greater hope of enjoying a blessing from the gods than those who slaughter many victims.
τῆς μὲν οὖν ταφῆς ὑμεῖς ἐστε κύριοι, τῶν δὲ διαθηκῶν ἐγώ·	Of his burial you are the masters.
καὶ παρεκάλεσεν αὐτούς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Αὐτοὶ οἴδατε ὅσα ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐποιήσαμεν περὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ τοὺς πολέμους καὶ τὰς στενοχωρίας.	And he encouraged them and said to them, “You know yourselves how much I and my brothers and my father’s house have done for the laws and the sanctuary and the battles and the difficulties.
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι μετὰ Θησέως στρατεύσαντες αἱροῦσι Θήβας καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς τοῖς οἰκείοις διδόασι θάψαι.	And the Athenians marched with Theseus, captured Thebes, and gave the dead to their kinsfolk to bury.
τούτων γὰρ προαποδειχθέντων τίς οὐκ αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ καταγνώσεται τὴν μεγίστην ζημίαν, ἂν μὴ πειθαρχῇ τοῖς ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ συμβουλευθεῖσι καὶ προσταχθεῖσιν;	For, once these claims have been established, who will not condemn himself to the severest punishment if he fails to heed my counsels and commands?
ἐς ταύτην τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ἀνιοῦσίν ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Μεγαρέως μνῆμα, ὃς κατὰ τὴν ἐπιστρατείαν τῶν Κρητῶν ξύμμαχός σφισιν ἦλθεν ἐξ Ὀγχηστοῦ.	As you ascend this citadel you see on the right the tomb of Megareus, who at the time of the Cretan invasion came as an ally from Onchestus.
ὡς ἔμ᾽ ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηΐδα Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων, τὴν μὲν ἐγὼ σὺν νηΐ τ᾽ ἐμῇ καὶ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισι πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ᾽ ἄγω Βρισηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον αὐτὸς ἰὼν κλισίην δὲ τὸ σὸν γέρας ὄφρ᾽ ἐῢ εἰδῇς ὅσσον φέρτερός εἰμι σέθεν, στυγέῃ δὲ καὶ ἄλλος ἶσον ἐμοὶ φάσθαι καὶ ὁμοιωθήμεναι ἄντην.	as Phoebus Apollo takes from me the daughter of Chryses, her with my ship and my companions I will send back, but I will myself come to your tent and take the fair-cheeked Briseis, your prize, so that you will understand how much mightier I am than you, and another may shrink from declaring himself my equal and likening himself to me to my face.
Βίβλος γενέσεως Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, υἱοῦ Δαυίδ, υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ.	The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
πεποίηται δέ σφισιν ὁ πόλεμος οὗτος καὶ τῇ Ἀθηνᾷ ἐπὶ τῇ ἀσπίδι καὶ τοῦ Ὀλυμπίου Διὸς ἐπὶ τῷ βάθρῳ.	This war they have also represented on the shield of their Athena and upon the pedestal of the Olympian Zeus.
τὸ δὲ πρὸς οὓς δεῖ λέγειν, ἄν τε πρὸς πρεσβυτέρους ἁμαρτάνοντας διαλέγῃ, ἁρμόττοντας δεῖ τοὺς λόγους διαλέγεσθαι ὡς πρεσβυτέροις·	To speak to the proper audience means this in addressing persons older than yourself, the discourse must be made suitable to the audience as being elderly men
καὶ ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ κατῴκησαν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐφράιμ καὶ Μανασσή.	They dwelled in Jerusalem, some of the descendants of Judah and some of the descendants of Benjamin and of the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh.
ταῦθ’ ὑποθεὶς ἐπεῖπεν ἐντεινάμενος ταύτην τὴν ὀξεῖαν καὶ ἀνόσιον φωνήν, ὡς δεινόν, εἰ ὁ μὲν τοὺς Καρίωνας καὶ Ξανθίας ὑποκρινόμενος οὕτως εὐγενὴς καὶ μεγαλόψυχος γένοιτο, ἐγὼ δ’ ὁ τῆς μεγίστης σύμβουλος πόλεως, ὁ τοὺς μυρίους Ἀρκάδων νουθετῶν, οὐ κατάσχοιμι τὴν ὓβριν, ἀλλὰ παραθερμανθείς, ὅθ’ ἡμᾶς εἱστία Ξενόδοκος τῶν ἑταίρων τις τῶν Φιλιππου, ἕλκοιμι τῶν τριχῶν καὶ λαβὼν ῥυτῆρα μαστιγοίην αἰχμάλωτον γυναῖκα.	“How outrageous that when a man whose business it is to act the parts of a Carion or of a Xanthias showed himself so noble and generous, Aeschines, the counsellor of the greatest city, the adviser of the Ten Thousand of Arcadia, did not restrain his insolence, but in drunken heat, when Xenodocus, one of the picked corps of Philip, was entertaining us, seized a captive woman by the hair, and took a strap and flogged her!”
τῶν ἀθρόοις ἀνδησάμενοι θαμάκις ἔρνεσιν χαίτας ῥεέθροισί τε Δίρκας ἔφανεν καὶ παρ’ Εὐρώτᾳ πέλας, Ἰφικλέος μὲν παῖς ὁμόδαμος ἐὼν Σπαρτῶν γένει, Τυνδαρίδας δ’ ἐν Ἀχαιοῖς ὑψίπεδον Θεράπνας οἰκ έω ν ἕδος.	Often crowning their hair with wreaths from these contests they appeared beside the streams of Dirce or near the Eurotas, the son of Iphicles, who was of the same city as the race of the Sown Men, and the son of Tyndareus, dwelling among the Achaeans in his highland home of Therapne.
οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ὁρῶντες τοὺς Κερκυραίους πιεζομένους μᾶλλον ἤδη ἀπροφασίστως ἐπεκούρουν, τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀπεχόμενοι ὥστε μὴ ἐμβάλλειν τινί· ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἡ τροπὴ ἐγίγνετο λαμπρῶς καὶ ἐνέκειντο οἱ Κορίνθιοι, τότε δὴ ἔργου πᾶς εἴχετο ἤδη καὶ διεκέκριτο οὐδὲν ἔτι, ἀλλὰ ξυνέπεσεν ἐς τοῦτο ἀνάγκης ὥστε ἐπιχειρῆσαι ἀλλήλοις τοὺς Κορινθίους καὶ Ἀθηναίους.	Seeing the Corcyraeans hard pressed, the Athenians began at length to assist them more unequivocally. At first, it is true, they refrained from charging any ships; but when the rout was becoming patent, and the Corinthians were pressing on, the time at last came when every one set to, and all distinction was laid aside, and it came to this point, that the Corinthians and Athenians raised their hands against each other.
Καὶ ἐλιθοβόλουν τὸν Στέφανον, ἐπικαλούμενον καὶ λέγοντα, Κύριε Ἰησοῦ, δέξαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου.	And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
εἰ ἐκδικήσω αὐτοὺς ἐκδικήσει. υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τὰς ἀνομίας τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν διαμάρτυραι αὐτοῖς,	“Shall I punish them with punishment?” ’ Son of man, testify against them regarding the transgressions of their fathers,
Καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Γέγραπται, Ὁ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται· ὑμεῖς δὲ αὐτὸν ἐποιήσατε σπήλαιον λῃστῶν.	And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves.' "
καὶ τὸν καιρὸν μέμνησθε, ἐν ᾧ τὴν ψῆφον φέρετε.	And mark well the occasion on which you are casting your vote.
ἐπὶ τούτου Λακεδαιμόνιοι πολέμῳ κρατήσαντες πόλιν τῶν περιοικίδων ἠνδραποδίσαντο Αἴγυν, ὑποπτεύσαντες ὡς οἱ Αἰγῦται φρονοῦσι τὰ Ἀρκάδων.	In his reign the Lacedaemonians took by force of arms Aegys, a city of the Perioeci, and sold the inhabitants into slavery, suspecting them of Arcadian sympathies.
πρὸς μὲν οὖν τοὺς ἐκ λόγου τὰς εἰρημένας ἀπορίας ἔχοντας οὐ ῥᾴδιον διαλῦσαι μὴ τιθέντων τι καὶ τούτου μηκέτι λόγον ἀπαιτούντων·	however, it is not hard to solve this difficulty.
ἐμβλέψατε εἰς Ἀβραὰμ τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν, καὶ εἰς Σάρραν τὴν ὠδίνουσαν ὑμᾶς· ὅτι εἷς ἦν καὶ ἐκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ εὐλόγησα αὐτὸν καὶ ἠγάπησα αὐτόν.	Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who was in labor with you, because he was one, and I called him and blessed him and loved him.
τῷ γὰρ ὄντι γλαφυρῶς ὁ Παρρασίου γέγραπται καὶ πεποίκιλται καί τι προσέοικε·	For Parrhasius’s piece was daintily painted, and perhaps it might be something like the original.
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ καὶ Ἆγις νίκην τε ἤλπιζον καὶ τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἄρατον ἐνέκειντο ἀθρόοι μᾶλλον·	The Lacedaemonians under Agis, thinking that victory was theirs, pressed in close order yet harder on Aratus and his men.
Ὅτι τὸ ἐν Κόλχοις φυλασσόμενον οὐκ ἦν δέρας ἀληθῶς χρυσοῦν τοῦτο γὰρ ποιητικευόμενόν ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ βιβλίον ἐν δέρμασι γεγραμμένον περιέχον ὅπως δεῖ γίνεσθαι διὰ χειμείας χρυσόν. εἰκότως οὖν οἱ τότε χρυσοῦν ὠνόμαζον αὐτὸ διὰ τὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐνέργειαν.	It is a poetic fabrication that the object guarded in Colchis was a truly golden fleece; it was a book written on leather containing instructions on how to produce gold through alchemy. And so, in all likelihood, the men of that time called it ‘golden’ because of the alchemical power it possessed.
εἰ δέ τις ἔτι μνήμη τῆς Ἀντιπάτρου τοῦ παλαιοῦ μετριότητος ὑπελείπετο, καὶ ταύτην Δημήτριος ἐκαρποῦτο Φίλᾳ συνοικῶν καὶ τὸν ἐξ ἐκείνης υἱὸν ἔχων διάδοχον τῆς ἀρχῆς, ἤδη τότε μειράκιον ὄντα καὶ τῷ πατρὶ συστρατευόμενον.	And if there still remained any kindly memories of the elder Antipater’s moderation and justice, of these also Demetrius reaped the benefit, since he was the husband of Phila, Antipater’s daughter, and had a son by her to be his successor in the realm, a son who was already quite a youth, and was serving in the army under his father.
Ἔγνω δὲ Ἀδὰμ Εὕαν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν υἱόν. καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σὴθ λέγουσα Ἐξανέστησεν γάρ μοι ὁ θεὸς σπέρμα ἕτερον ἀντὶ Ἅβελ, ὃν ἀπέκτεινεν Κάιν.	Adam knew Eve, his wife, and, having conceived, she brought forth a son and called his name Seth, saying, “For God raised up for me another offspring in the place of Abel, whom Cain killed.”
ἐς πολλὸν δὲ ἐξάπτεσθαι ἔνι·	And we must allow it to burn a long while, for the heat within it, indeed, is a very good fomentation, and a good provocative of perspirations.
Κύριος ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ διέκυψεν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, τοῦ ἰδεῖν εἰ ἔστιν συνίων ἢ ἐκζητῶν τὸν θεόν.	The Lord looked out from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there is one who understands or one who seeks out God.
Ὁ δὲ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐπληθύνετο.	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
δούλων δὲ εἴδη δύο, ἐπίτροπος καὶ ἐργάτης.	Of slaves there are two kinds
εὐθύνῳ τοίνυν τἀναντία τούτων ὑπάρχει·	Well then, in the case of Euthynus the opposite is true
καὶ συμπερανθείσης, ὡς προείρηται, τῆς θυσίας ὑποστρέψας οἴκαδε καὶ κατακλιθείς, πρὶν αἰσθέσθαι καὶ νοῆσαι τὴν μεταβολήν, ἐν ἐκστάσει καὶ παραφορᾷ τῆς διανοίας γενόμενος τριταῖος ἐτελεύτησεν, οὐδενὸς ἐνδεὴς οὐδ’ ἀτελὴς τῶν πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν νενομισμένων γενόμενος.	When the sacrifice had been duly performed, he returned to his house and lay down to rest, and then, before he could notice and be conscious of any change, he became delirious and deranged in mind, and on the third day after died. He was fully blessed with everything that men think conducive to happiness.
καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἐν τῇ πόλει θησαυροὺς παρελάμβανε, τὴν δὲ πόλιν διαρπάσαι παρέδωκε τοῖς στρατιώταις, μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων χρημάτων ὀκτακισχίλια τάλαντα νομίσματος ἔχουσαν.	The royal treasures in the city he took into his own charge, but the city itself he turned over to his soldiers for plunder, and it contained eight thousand talents in money, together with the usual valuables.
τοιαῦτα διαλεχθείς, καὶ πρὸς τούς ἐνίστασθαι καὶ παρακαλεῖν ἐπιχειροῦντας ἀπισχυρισάμενος, τούς τε φίλους ἐκέλευεν ἀπαλλάττεσθαι καὶ τῶν συγκλητικῶν τούς παρόντας·	So he spake, and after resisting firmly those who tried to oppose and dissuade him, he ordered his friends to depart, as well as the men of senatorial rank who were present
παίξῃ δὲ ἐν αὐτῷ ὥσπερ ὀρνέῳ, ἢ δήσεις αὐτὸν ὥσπερ στρουθίον παιδίῳ;	And will you play with it like a bird, or will you tie it like a sparrow for a child?
τάδε μέντοι καὶ ὑπὸ τῇ γλώσσῃ ἔχειν ἐς τὸ διηνεκὲς τῆς συντήξιος.	These things, moreover, are good to be kept below the tongue during the whole time of melting
δαίμονας δ’ οὔτ’ εἶναι πιθανόν οὔτε ὄντας ἀνθρώπων ἔχειν εἶδος ἢ φωνὴν ἢ δύναμιν εἰς ἡμᾶς διήκουσαν·	As for genii, it is incredible either that they exist, or, if they do exist, that they have the appearance or the speech of men, or a power that extends to us.
ἦ κάρτ’ ἄτιμα καὶ παρ’ οὐδὲν εἰργάσω Ἥρας τελείας καὶ Διὸς πιστώματα.	Then truly you dishonor and bring to nothing the pledges of Hera, the Fulfiller, and Zeus.
καὶ νῦν, πάντες οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Βάαλ, πάντας τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καλέσατε πρὸς μέ· ἀνὴρ μὴ ἐπισκεπήτω, ὅτι θυσία μεγάλη μοι τῷ Βάαλ· πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν ἐπισκεπῇ οὐ ζήσεται. καὶ Εἰοὺ ἐποίησεν ἐν πτερνισμῷ, ἵνα ἀπολέσῃ τοὺς δούλους τοῦ Βάαλ.	Now! Summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and his priests. Let no man be overlooked because ⌊I will make a great offering⌋ to Baal. Everyone who ever overlooks the offering will not live.” But Jehu acted in deception in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
Ἀναχθέντες οὖν ἀπὸ τῆς Τρῳάδος, εὐθυδρομήσαμεν εἰς Σαμοθρᾴκην, τῇ τε ἐπιούσῃ εἰς Νεάπολιν,	Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,
περὶ δὲ τοὺς βωμοὺς τοὺς ἐκείνων ἐξήνθησεν ἡ γῆ κύκλῳ πολὺ κώνειον, ἄλλως μηδὲ τῆς χώρας πολλαχοῦ φυόμενον·	again, all around the altars of those Saviour-gods the soil teemed with hemlock, a plant which did not grow in many other parts of the country at all
ἐκ δὲ τῆς νεύσεως ῥοπὴν ἤτοι πρὸς βαρύτητα ἢ κουφότητα.	but being in the place where another should be, then it has an inclination by which it tends to gravity or levity.
ὁ δὲ τῷ ἀνίσῳ, ὡς ἴσῳ τῷ ἑνὶ χρώμενος, ὡς ἐξ ἐναντίων εἴη ἂν ὁ ἀριθμός·	and another ( treating it as the equal ) as contrary to the unequal, number must be derived as from contraries.
ὁ γὰρ πρεσβύτερος ἀδελφὸς Πανταλέων ἅπαντα παρέλαβε, καὶ ἐπιτροπεύσας ἡμᾶς τῶν πατρῴων ἀπεστέρησεν, ὥστε πολλῶν ἕνεκα, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, προσήκει μοι αὐτὸν βούλεσθαι ζῆν.	for my elder brother Pantaleon took over everything, and on becoming our guardian he deprived us of our patrimony so that I have many good reasons, gentlemen, for wishing my father alive.
τοῦτο γὰρ πάντῃ ὄν· τὰ δὲ ἄλλα πὼς μὲν προστιθέμενα ποιήσει μεῖζον, πὼς δ᾽ οὐθέν, οἷον ἐπίπεδον καὶ γραμμή, στιγμὴ δὲ καὶ μονὰς οὐδαμῶς ]· ἀλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ οὗτος θεωρεῖ φορτικῶς, καὶ ἐνδέχεται εἶναι ἀδιαίρετόν τι ὥστε [καὶ οὕτως] καὶ πρὸς ἐκεῖνόν τιν᾽ ἀπολογίαν ἔχειν [ μεῖζον μὲν γὰρ οὐ ποιήσει πλεῖον δὲ προστιθέμενον τὸ τοιοῦτον ]· ἀλλὰ πῶς δὴ ἐξ ἑνὸς τοιούτου ἢ πλειόνων τοιούτων ἔσται μέγεθος;	and if it is a spatial magnitude it is corporeal, since the corporeal exists in all dimensions, whereas the other magnitudes, the plane or line, when added to a thing in one way will increase it, but when added in another will not; and the point or unit will not increase a thing in any way whatever. but since zeno's view is unsound, and it is possible for a thing to be indivisible in such a way that it can be defended even against his argument ( for such a
καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ δεσπότης τῶν ἁπάντων περὶ μετανοίας ἐλάλησεν μετὰ ὅρκου:	and even the Master of the universe himself spoke with an oath concerning repentance
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἠσαίας Οὕτως ἐρεῖτε πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων ὧν ἤκουσας, οὓς ὠνείδισάν με οἱ πρέσβεις βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.	and Isaiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to your lord: ‘This is what the Lord says: “Do not be frightened by the words that you have heard, with which the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians reproached me.
καὶ ἔπιεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου καὶ ἐμεθύσθη, καὶ ἐγυμνώθη ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.	And he drank from the wine and was drunk and was stripped naked in his house.
καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ, Οὗτός ἐστιν Ἰωάννης ὁ βαπτιστής· αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο αἱ δυνάμεις ἐνεργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτῷ.	and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
παρήγγελτο δ’ αὐτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις πεζοῖς ἐκκλίνειν τὴν ὁρμὴν τῶν θηρίων, καὶ περιθέοντας ἀκοντίζειν ἐς αὐτὰ συνεχῶς, καὶ προσπελάζοντας, ὅτε δύναιντο, ὑποτέμνειν τὰ νεῦρα.	He ordered these and the other foot-soldiers to avoid the impetus of these beasts by turning aside and continually hurling javelins at them, and by darting around them to hamstring them whenever they could. In this way Scipio disposed his infantry.
οὐ γὰρ αὖ μανθάνω ὡς ἔστιν τὸ αὐτό, ἃ οἶδεν εἰδέναι καὶ ἅ τις μὴ οἶδεν εἰδέναι.	I still do not see how knowing what one knows and does not know is the same as the other.How do you mean?
οὐ κομπάσαιμ᾽ ἂν θεσφάτων γνώμων ἄκρος εἶναι, κακῷ δέ τῳ προσεικάζω τάδε.	i would not boast to be a topping critic of oracles: but to some sort of evil i liken these.
καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν παλλακῶν αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν Ἀβραὰμ δόματα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔτι ζῶντος αὐτοῦ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς εἰς γῆν ἀνατολῶν.	And to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from Isaac, his son, while he was living still, toward the east in the land of the east.
ἐσθέμενοι δὲ ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἔπλεον τὴν ἐπὶ Ἰονίου, Μοθωναίων ἐρημώσαντες τὸ ἄστυ.	Carrying them on board ship, they set sail for the Ionian sea, having desolated the city of the Mothonaeans.
εἰ δ᾽ ἔστιν ἕτερός τις Ποσειδῶν, τὸν ἕτερον.	yes, and by all the other poseidons, if such there be.
Ἀμύκλας δὲ ὁ Λακεδαίμονος, βουλόμενος ὑπολιπέσθαι τι καὶ αὐτὸς ἐς μνήμην, πόλισμα ἔκτισεν ἐν τῇ Λακωνικῇ.	Amyclas, too, son of Lacedaemon, wished to leave some memorial behind him, and built a town in Laconia.
περί τε οὖν τούτων ἡδέως ἂν πυθοίμην, ὅ τι ποτ’ ἦν τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ μηδὲν τούτων γεγενῆσθαι περὶ τῆς ἐγγυητῆς ὡς μεμαρτύρηκεν οὗτος γυναικός,	Or did he ever, during all that long period, go and make any claim upon the heir regarding his sister's dowry in the presence of any witness? I should be glad to learn what was the reason why none of these steps has been taken in favor of a woman, who, according to the defendant's evidence, was legally married.
καὶ μὴν τοῦτό γε αὐτό, ἡ εὐβουλία, δῆλον ὅτι ἐπιστήμη τίς ἐστιν·	And surely this very thing, good counsel, is a form of wisdom.
οὐ τὸ σῶμα δήπου πλάττοντες ἡμῶν, οὐδὲ τὰς χεῖρας, ὡς δεῖ, μετατιθέντες αὐτοὶ καὶ τοὺς πόδας, ἀλλὰ τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ πρακτικὸν καὶ προαιρετικὸν ἀρχαῖς τισι καὶ φαντασίαις καὶ ἐπινοίαις ἐγείροντες ἢ τοὐναντίον ἀποστρέφοντες καὶ ἱστάντες.	They certainly do not mould our bodies by their direct agency, nor give the requisite change to the action of our hands and feet, but rather, by certain motives, conceptions, and purposes, they rouse the active and elective powers of our spirits, or, on the other hand, divert and check them.
καὶ Ῥεννὰ καὶ Πόλις γραμμάτων, αὕτη Δαβείρ,	and Dannah and the City of Letters (this is Debir)
πῦρ εἶναι στοιχεῖον καὶ πυρὸς ἀμοιβὴν τὰ πάντα, ἀραιώσει καὶ πυκνώσει γινόμενα.	fire is the element, all things are exchange for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation
Βρασίδας μὲν οὖν καὶ τὸ πλῆθος εὐθὺς ἄνω καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ μετέωρα τῆς πόλεως ἐτράπετο, βουλόμενος κατ’ ἄκρας καὶ βεβαίως ἑλεῖν αὐτήν· ὁ δὲ ἄλλος ὅμιλος κατὰ πάντα ὁμοίως ἐσκεδάννυντο.	Brasidas and the greater number making straight uphill for the higher part of the town, in order to take it from top to bottom, and once for all, while the rest of the multitude spread in all directions.
θηρία τε γὰρ πάμπολλα συνεωνημένος ἐκέλευσε μηδὲν ἀποδόσθαι μηδ’ ὑπολιπεῖν, ἀλλὰ πᾶσι καταχρήσασθαι, καὶ τῶν περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνιτῶν αὐτὸς εἰς Νέαν πόλιν καταβὰς ἐνέτυχε πλείστοις·	For Brutus had purchased a great number of wild beasts, and now gave orders that not one should be sold or left behind, but that all should be used; and he himself went down to Naples and conferred with a very large number of actors;
τὰ πρωτογενήματα τῆς γῆς σου θήσεις εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ σου. οὐ προσοίσεις ἄρνα ἐν γάλακτι μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.	The best of the firstfruits of your land you will bring into the house of the Lord, your God. You will not present a kid in its mother’s milk.”
δεῖ δὲ οὐ μακρὰν ἐλθόντας ποι τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐναργῶς ἰδεῖν, ἀλλ’ ὅσα νῦν γέγονεν τῇδε, αὐτοῦ περὶ Σικελίαν, τῶν μὲν ἐπιχειρούντων δρᾶν, τῶν δὲ ἀμύνασθαι τοὺς δρῶντας·	And without going far afield one may see such consequences clearly in the recent events in Sicily itself, where the one faction is trying to inflict injury and the other to ward off the injurers
" πάλιν οὖν αὐτῷ παρ’ ἡμῶν ἀντιμαρτυρῶν ὁ αὐτὸς λόγος ἀντιπαραβαλλέσθω·	Let us testify against him in return, and set our argument beside his in the same form.
Θαύ. Εἰσέλθοι πᾶσα ἡ κακία αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ ἐπιφύλλισον αὐτοῖς ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν ἐπιφυλλίδα περὶ πάντων τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων μου, ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ στεναγμοί μου, καὶ ἡ καρδία μου λυπεῖται.	Thau. May all their evil go in before you, and glean them, just as they have made a gleaning about all my sins; for my groanings are many, and my heart is grieved.
Ἰούδας ὁ καλούμενος Μακκαβαῖος,	Judas, who was called Maccabeus;
καὶ ὁ οἶκος πλήρης τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα ὡς ἑπτακόσιοι ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες οἱ θεωροῦντες ἐν παιγνίαις Σαμψών.	The house was full of men and of women. There also were all the rulers of the Philistines, and upon the roof about seven hundred men and women, those looking on the tormenting of Samson.
ἀγαλλιάσομαι ἐγὼ ἐπὶ τὰ λόγιά σου, ὡς ὁ εὑρίσκων σκῦλα πολλά.	I will rejoice exceedingly in your words, as the one who finds many spoils.
τῆς δὲ τούτων οὐσίας, ὦ ἄνδρες, εἰς τὴν πόλιν πλείω ἀναλίσκεται ἢ εἰς αὐτοὺς τούτους.	Now the family fortune, gentlemen, is being spent rather upon the city than upon the members of the family themselves.
ἐπὶ τῶνδε ὦν ὕδωρ ψυχρὸνἄκος ἂν γίγνοιτο εὐτυχίῃ τοῦ χρεομένου·	In them, then, cold water might prove a remedy through the good luck of the person using it
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἔτι τούτων πρεσβύτερα, Κίνναι καὶ Μάριοι καὶ Κάρβωνες, ἆθλον ἐν μέσῳ καὶ λείαν προθέμενοι τὴν πατρίδα, μονονουχὶ ῥητῶς ὑπὲρ τυραννίδος ἐπολέμησαν.	For the men of a still earlier time than Pompey and Cassius, men like Cinna and Marius and Carbo, made their country the booty or prize round which they fought, and they all but confessed that they waged war to establish a tyranny.
βασιλέως ἐν ἀληθείᾳ κρίνοντος πτωχούς, ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ εἰς μαρτύριον κατασταθήσεται.	When a king judges the poor with truth, his throne will be established as a testimony.
τὸ πρόχειρον ἅπασι πῦρ ὕδατι μιγνύναι τὸ παροιμιαζόμενον ἐν τοῖς ἀδυνάτοις, μαρτυρεῖν ἔοικεν ὅτι τῷ πυρὶ τὸ ὕδωρ πολέμιόν ἐστι καὶ ὑπὸ τούτου φθείρεται καὶ κολάζεται σβεννύμενον, οὐχ ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀέρος τίον ὡς ὑπολαμβάνει τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ δέχεται μεταβάλλοντος·	to show that water is an enemy to fire, and being extinguished thereby, is destroyed and punished by it,—not by the air, which, upon the change and destruction of it, receives and entertains the substance of it.
Τηλέγονος Ὀδυσσέως καὶ Κίρκης ἐπ’ ἀναζήτησιν τοῦ πατρὸς πεμφθεὶς ἔμαθε πόλιν κτίσαι, ἔνθα ἂν ἴδῃ γεωργοὺς ἐστεφανωμένους καὶ χορεύοντας.	Telegonus, the son of Ulysses by Circe, was sent to find out his father, and commanded by an oracle to erect a city where he should see the country people dancing with garlands.
εἶχον δὲ δεξιὸν μὲν κέρας Θηβαῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμοροι αὐτοῖς· μέσοι δὲ Ἁλιάρτιοι καὶ Κορωναῖοι καὶ Κωπαιῆς καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι οἱ περὶ τὴν λίμνην· τὸ δὲ εὐώνυμον εἶχον Θεσπιῆς καὶ Ταναγραῖοι καὶ Ὀρχομένιοι. ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ κέρᾳ ἑκατέρῳ οἱ ἱππῆς καὶ ψιλοὶ ἦσαν. ἐπ’ ἀσπίδας δὲ πέντε μὲν καὶ εἴκοσι Θηβαῖοι ἐτάξαντο, οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ὡς ἕκαστοι ἔτυχον.	On their right were the Thebans and those of their province, in the center the Haliartians, Coronaeans, Copaeans, and the other people around the lake, and on the left the Thespians, Tanagraeans, and Orchomenians, the cavalry and the light troops being at the extremity of each wing. The Thebans formed twenty-five shields deep, the rest as they pleased.
Ὁ δὲ ἐγερθεὶς παρέλαβεν τὸ παιδίον καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς γῆν Ἰσραήλ.	Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
εἰ δὲ τὴν φύσιν μὲν ἐχθροὶ τὸν δὲ νοῦν εἰσιν φίλοι, καὶ διδάξοντές τι δεῦρ᾽ ἥκουσιν ὑμᾶς χρήσιμον;	if they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart, and they come here to give you useful advice.
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωδᾶε ὁ ἱερεύς· καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἰωδᾶε ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχοις καὶ τοῖς ἀρχηγοῖς τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἐκβάλετε αὐτὴν ἐκτὸς τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ εἰσέλθατε ὀπίσω αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀποθανέτω μαχαίρᾳ· ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεύς Μὴ ἀποθανέτω ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.	Jehoiada the priest went out, and Jehoiada the priest commanded the leaders of hundreds and the chiefs of the force and said to them, “Throw her outside of the house, and go after her, and let her die by a large knife,” because the priest said, “Let her not die in the house of the Lord.”
γενόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ στρατοπέδου τά τε ἄλλα παρεῖχεν ἑαυτὸν εὐδόκιμον, καὶ καιρῷ παραπεσόντι χρησάμενος εὖ φίλον ἐποιήσατο τὸν τῶν Νομάδων βασιλέα Βόκχον.	He was put in charge of the camp, and won great credit for himself, especially by improving a favourable opportunity and making a friend of Bocchus, the king of Numidia.
Καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ πάλιν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ περὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτόν.	In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter.
δευτέρου δὲ γεννᾶσθαι μέλλοντος βρέφους ἔδοξεν Ἑκάβη καθ’ ὕπνους δαλὸν τεκεῖν διάπυρον, τοῦτον δὲ πᾶσαν ἐπινέμεσθαι τὴν πόλιν καὶ καίειν.	and when a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it.
εὐφράνθητι, ἔρημος καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῆς, ἐπαύλεις καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Κηδάρ. εὐφρανθήσονται οἱ κατοικοῦντες πέτραν, ἀπ᾽ ἄκρου τῶν ὀρέων βοήσουσιν·	Rejoice, desert and its villages, unwalled villages and those who inhabit Kedar! Those who inhabit Petra will rejoice, from the topmost point of the mountains they will shout;
τίς ὁ κραιπνῷ ποδὶ πήδη - μα τόδ᾽ εὐπετῶς ἀνᾴσσων;	who with agile foot can lightly overleap and escape its toils?
ὅμως δὲ καὶ εἰ ἀσθενές τι καὶ οὐ κεκριμένον, ἀλλ’ οὖν προσαυλεῖται.	still, even though it is sorry stuff and nothing exquisite, it is accompanied by flute-music.
πολυπραγμονοῦντες γὰρ ἀπώλεσαν τὴν δύναμιν Ῥωμαῖοι δὲ παρὰ τοὺς Φαβίου λογισμοὺς ἐκπέμψαντες ἐπὶ Καρχηδονίους Σκηπίωνα πάντων ἐκράτησαν, οὐ τύχῃ, σοφίᾳ δὲ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ καὶ ἀνδρείᾳ κατὰ κράτος νικήσαντος τοὺς πολεμίους.	for they undertook too much and lost their empire. But it was contrary to the principles of Fabius that the Romans sent Scipio against Carthage and were completely victorious, not through the favour of fortune, but through the wisdom and valour of the general who utterly conquered their enemies.
καὶ κατ’ ἄλλους δὲ τρόπους πλείους αἱ τῶν τοιούτων συστάσεις οὐκ ἀδυνατοῦσι συντελεῖσθαι.	and there are several other ways in which it is not impossible for the aggregations of such bodies into clouds to be brought about.
Καὶ ὅτε εἶδον αὐτόν, ἔπεσα πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ὡς νεκρός· καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπ' ἐμέ, λέγων, Μὴ φοβοῦ· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος,	And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, "Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.
μέχρι τοῦδε φαίη τις ἂν Λουκούλλῳ τὴν τύχην ἑπομένην συστρατηγεῖν. ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ὥσπερ πνεύματος ἐπιλιπόντος προσβιαζόμενος πάντα καὶ παντάπασιν ἀντικρούων ἀρετὴν μὲν ἐπεδείκνυτο καὶ μακροθυμίαν ἡγεμόνος ἀγαθοῦ, δόξαν δὲ καὶ χάριν οὐδεμίαν αἱ πράξεις ἔσχον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν προϋπάρχουσαν ἐγγὺς ἦλθε δυσπραγῶν καὶ διαφερόμενος μάτην ἀποβαλεῖν.	Up to this point, one might say that fortune had followed Lucullus and fought on his side; but from now on, as though a favouring breeze had failed him, he had to force every issue, and met with obstacles everywhere. He still displayed the bravery and patience of a good leader, but his undertakings brought him no new fame or favour; indeed, so ill-starred and devious was his course, that he came near losing that which he had already won.
εἶπεν δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ πρὸς Ἰσαάκ Ἄπελθε ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν, ὅτι δυνατώτερος ἡμῶν ἐγένου σφόδρα.	Abimelech said to Isaac, “Depart from us, because you have become exceedingly stronger than us.”
ταραχῇ ταραχθήσεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἀπορίᾳ ἀπορηθήσεται ἡ γῆ.	The land will be troubled with trouble, and the land will be challenged with challenge.
ὃ δὲ ἦν ὑπόλοιπον αὐτοῖς, Κερσοβλέπτην καὶ τὸν ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης τόπον ἔκδοτον ποιῆσαι, καὶ τοῦτ’ ἔπραξαν ἕκτῃ φθίνοντος τοῦ Ἐλαφηβολιῶνος, πρὶν ἐπὶ τὴν ὑστέραν ἀπαίρειν πρεσβείαν τὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὅρκους Δημοσθένην·	One thing remained now for them to do—to betray Cersobleptes and the Thracian coast.
καὶ οὐ πάντα φωρᾶται ταύταις ἀλλ’ ἐκφεύγει πολλὰ διὰ μικρότητα τὴν αἴσθησιν.	And though every one of us consists of a body and soul, yet the hegemonic and intellectual faculty is small, being hid in the huge mass of flesh.
καὶ αἱρεῖ τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ Ποτιδανίαν καὶ τῇ δευτέρᾳ Κροκύλειον καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ Τείχιον, ἔμενέ τε αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν λείαν ἐς Εὐπάλιον τῆς Λοκρίδος ἀπέπεμψεν· τὴν γὰρ γνώμην εἶχε τὰ ἄλλα καταστρεψάμενος οὕτως ἐπὶ Ὀφιονέας, εἰ μὴ βούλοιντο ξυγχωρεῖν, ἐς Ναύπακτον ἐπαναχωρήσας στρατεῦσαι ὕστερον.	The first day he took Potidania, the next Krokyle, and the third Tichium, where he halted and sent back the booty to Eupalium in Locris, having determined to pursue his conquests as far as the Ophionians, and in the event of their refusing to submit, to return to Naupactus and make them the objects of a second expedition.
καὶ ἀποκριθέντες τῷ Ἰησοῖ εἶπαν Πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλῃ ἡμῖν ποιήσομεν, καὶ εἰς πάντα τόπον οὗ ἐὰν ἀποστείλῃς ἡμᾶς πορευσόμεθα.	And answering Joshua, they said, “Everything, as much as you command to us, we will do, and every place where you send us, we will go.
κρείσσων ξενισμὸς μετὰ λαχάνων πρὸς φιλίαν καὶ χάριν ἢ παράθεσις μόσχων μετὰ ἔχθρας.	Better is hospitality with vegetables, with love and grace, than provisions of calves with enmity.
Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ὀγδόῳ ἐκραταίωσεν Ἰωδᾶε καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχους, τὸν Ἀζαρίαν υἱὸν Ἰωρὰμ καὶ τὸν Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸν Ἰωανὰν καὶ τὸν Ἀζαρίαν υἱὸν Ὠβὴδ καὶ τὸν Μασσαίαν υἱὸν Ἀζειὰ καὶ τὸν Ἐλεισαφὰν υἱὸν Ζαχαριά, μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς οἶκον.	In the eighth year Jehoiada grew strong and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah son of Joram, and Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and Azariah son of Obed, and Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elizaphan son of Zechariah, with him into a house.
Καὶ ὁ καρδιογνώστης θεὸς ἐμαρτύρησεν αὐτοῖς, δοὺς αὐτοῖς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον, καθὼς καὶ ἡμῖν·	"So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,
Ἡγούμενόν σε κατέστησαν; μὴ ἐπαίρου· γίνου ἐν αὐτοῖς ὡς εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, φρόντισον αὐτῶν καὶ οὕτω κάθισον·	Have they appointed you as head of a feast? Do not exalt yourself; be among them like one of them; be considerate of them, and in the same manner, sit down;
καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Γάλααδ τοῦ λαλῆσαι καὶ εἶπεν Ἰδοὺ λαὸς καταβαίνων κατὰ θάλασσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐχόμενα ὀμφαλοῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀρχὴ ἑτέρα ἔρχεται διὰ ὁδοῦ Ἠλωνμαωνεμείν.	Gaal continued to speak and said, “Behold, people are going down by the sea from the place bordering the middle of the land, and another company coming by the road Elon-maonenim.”
τὸ δ’ ἔτι βραχὺ πρὸ τοῦ λόγου δεῖ δηλῶσαι, μὴ πολλάκις ἀκούοντες Ἑλληνικὰ βαρβάρων ἀνδρῶν ὀνόματα θαυμάζητε·	But before I begin my account, there is still a small point which I ought to explain, lest you should be surprised at frequently hearing Greek names given to barbarians.
καὶ μὴν ὅσης προσήκει τιμῆς τυγχάνειν τοὺς τηλικούτων ἀγαθῶν αἰτίους, περίεργον διδάσκειν·	And surely it is superfluous to attempt to show how high is the honor which the authors of such great blessings deserve
ἐπανάγουσι δὲ καὶ τῶν παρθένων τὸν ἀγῶνα ἐς τὰ ἀρχαῖα, Ἱπποδάμειαν τῇ Ἤρᾳ τῶν γάμων τῶν Πέλοπος ἐκτίνουσαν χάριν τάς τε ἑκκαίδεκα ἀθροῖσαι γυναῖκας λέγοντες καὶ σὺν αὐταῖς διαθεῖναι πρώτην τὰ Ἡραῖα·	The games of the maidens too are traced back to ancient times they say that, out of gratitude to Hera for her marriage with Pelops, Hippodameia assembled the Sixteen Women, and with them inaugurated the Heraea.
ὡς καλάμη ἐλογίσθησαν σφυρά, καταγελᾷ δὲ σεισμοῦ πυρφόρου.	A hammer is counted as straw, and it laughs at the rattling of fire-bearers.
καὶ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων λέγοντες Τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἀπῴκισας καὶ ἀντεκάθισας ἐν πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὸ κρίμα τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς αὐτοὺς τοὺς λέοντας· καὶ ἰδού εἰσιν θανατοῦντες αὐτούς, καθότι οὐκ οἴδασιν τὸ κρίμα τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς γῆς.	They said to the king of Assyria, saying, “The peoples who you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the God of the land. He has sent lions against them. Look, they are killing them, as they do not know the law of the God of the land.”
ἆρ’ οὖν οὐ καὶ σώφρονα κατὰ πάντα ταῦτα;	And is it not also to be called sober in all these respects?
τοῦ δ’ αὐτοῦ θέρους Μεγαρῆς οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει πιεζόμενοι ὑπό τε Ἀθηναίων τῷ πολέμῳ, αἰεὶ κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον δὶς ἐσβαλλόντων πανστρατιᾷ ἐς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν σφετέρων φυγάδων τῶν ἐκ Πηγῶν, οἳ στασιασάντων ἐκπεσόντες ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους χαλεποὶ ἦσαν λῃστεύοντες, ἐποιοῦντο λόγους ἐν ἀλλήλοις ὡς χρὴ δεξαμένους τοὺς φεύγοντας μὴ ἀμφοτέρωθεν τὴν πόλιν φθείρειν.	The same summer the Megarians in the city, pressed by the hostilities of the Athenians, who invaded their country twice every year with all their forces, and harassed by the incursions of their own exiles at Pegae, who had been expelled in a revolution by the popular party, began to ask each other whether it would not be better to receive back their exiles, and free the town from one of its two scourges.
καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἀγαλλιάσονται ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, καὶ ἐν τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ σου ὑψωθήσονται.	And in your name they will rejoice exceedingly the whole day, and in your righteousness they will be raised up.
τηροῦμαι δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶνδ᾽, ἐπεὶ βούλομαί γε πάλαι μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν ἐλθὼν ἐπὶ τοὺς καδίσκους κακόν τι ποιῆσαι.	i am detained here, because i have long wanted to go with you to the law - court and do all the harm i can. oh!
καὶ ἔσται εἰς εὐφροσύνην καὶ αἴνεσιν καὶ εἰς μεγαλειότητα παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς οἵτινες ἀκούσονται πάντα τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἃ ἐγὼ ποιήσω, καὶ φοβηθήσονται καὶ πικρανθήσονται περὶ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν καὶ περὶ πάσης τῆς εἰρήνης ἧς ἐγὼ ποιήσω αὐτοῖς.	And it will be for merriment and praise, and for majesty to all the people of the earth, whoever will hear all the good things that I will do. And they will fear and be embittered concerning all the good and concerning all the peace that I will make for them.’
καταδυναστεύσωμεν πένητα δίκαιον, μὴ φεισώμεθα χήρας, μηδὲ πρεσβύτου ἐντραπῶμεν πολιὰς πολυχρονίους·	Let us oppress a poor righteous person; let us not spare a widow or respect the ancient grey hairs of an old man;
ὧν οὐ μόνον ἡ βλάβη ἠδύνατο συνεκτρῖψαι αὐτούς, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡ ὄψις ἐκφοβήσασα διολέσαι.	of which not only would the injury be able to destroy them, but even the frightening sight to destroy them.
τότε δὲ ὁ Γάλβας, Λευκόλλου φιλοχρηματώτερος ὤν, ὀλίγα μέν τινα τῆς λείας τῇ στρατιᾷ διεδίδου, καὶ ὀλίγα τοῖς φίλοις, τὰ λοιπὰ δὲ ἐσφετερίζετο, καίτοι πλουσιώτατος ὢν ὁμοῦ τι Ῥωμαίων·	Galba, being even more greedy than Lucullus, distributed a little of the plunder to the army and a little to his friends and kept the rest himself, although he was already one of the richest of the Romans.
μὰ Δί᾽ οὐ γὰρ ἐπῆν τῆς Ἀφροδίτης οὐδέν σοι.	no sir, you've got nothing to do with aphrodite.
τὸ γὰρ ἀνθρώπῳ εἶναι καὶ τὸ μὴ ἀνθρώπῳ εἶναι ἕτερον σημαίνει, εἴπερ καὶ τὸ λευκὸν εἶναι καὶ τὸ ἄνθρωπον εἶναι ἕτερον· πολὺ γὰρ ἀντίκειται ἐκεῖνο μᾶλλον, ὥστε σημαίνειν ἕτερον.	because " being man " and " being not - man " have different meanings if " being white " and " being man " have different meanings ( for the opposition is much stronger in the former case so as to produce different meanings ).
οὗτοι ἐξ Ἡφαιστίνης, αἱ δὲ ἐκ Κρινοῦς.	the mother of these men was Hephaestine, and the mother of these damsels was Crino.
Οἱ δὲ ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον, Ἰωάννην τὸν βαπτιστήν· ἄλλοι δὲ Ἠλίαν· ἄλλοι δὲ ὅτι Προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀνέστη.	So they answered and said, "John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again."
οὐ χαιρήσεις, ἀλλά σε κλέπτονθ᾽ αἱρήσω γ᾽ὼ τρεῖς μυριάδας. τί θαλαττοκοπεῖς καὶ πλατυγίζεις, μιαρώτατος ὢν περὶ τὸν δῆμον τὸν Ἀθηναίων; καί σ᾽ ἐπιδείξω νὴ τὴν Δήμητρ᾽, ἢ μὴ ζῴην, δωροδοκήσαντ᾽ ἐκ Μυτιλήνης πλεῖν ἢ μνᾶς τετταράκοντα.	tremble, knave; i will convict you of having stolen thirty thousand drachmae. for a rascal of your kidney, you shout rarely! well! i am ready to die if i do not prove that you have accepted more than forty minae from the mitylenaeans. singing this indeed may be termed talking.
τὰ μὲν δὴ πρὸς τῶν ὀρῶν Φωκεῖς ὑπεροικοῦσιν Ὀρχομενίων, ἐν δὲ τῷ πεδίῳ Λεβάδειά ἐστιν αὐτοῖς ὅμορος.	On the side towards the mountains the boundary of Orchomenus is Phocis, but on the plain it is Lebadeia.
καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ αὐτόχειρες τὴν σκευὴν τοῦ πλοίου ἐρρίψαμεν.	On the third day we threw the ship's tackle overboard with our own hands.
τοὺς δὲ διασωθέντας ἐκ τῆς θαλάττης πρῶτον μὲν ἐπὶ τὰς προκειμένας νήσους οἰκουμένας δ’ ὑφ’ Ἑλλήνων κατίσχειν καὶ τὸν ἥλιον ὁρᾶν κρυπτόμενον ὥρας μιᾶς ἔλαττον ἐφ’ ἡμέρας τριάκοντα καὶ νύκτα τοῦτ’ εἶναι, σκότος ἔχουσαν ἐλαφρὸν καὶ λυκαυγὲς ἀπὸ δυσμῶν περιλαμπόμενον ἐκεῖ διατρίψαντας ἡμέρας ἐνενήκοντα, μετὰ τιμῆς καὶ φιλοφροσύνης ἱεροὺς νομιζομένους καὶ προσαγορευομένους, ὑπὸ πνευμάτων ἢδη περαιοῦσθαι·	Now such as have in safety passed the danger of the sea go first ashore in those opposite islands, which are inhabited by the Greeks, where they see that the sun is scarce hidden one full hour during the space of thirty days, and that this is their night, of which the darkness is but small, as having a twilight from the going down of the sun not unlike the dawning of the day
ἀλλ’ οὐ τοῦτο ἐρωτῶ, ἀλλὰ σὺ ἐπὶ τί φῂς ἴτας εἶναι τοὺς ἀνδρείους;	But my point is rather, towards what, according to you, are the brave impetuous?
ὃ μή πω κατειλήφει πρότερον Ἕλληνας· οὐδὲ γὰρ Μακεδόνων οἱ ἰσχύσαντες μέγιστον, Φίλιππος Ἀμύντου καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος, τοὺς ἀνθεστηκότας σφίσιν Ἑλλήνων ἐς Μακεδονίαν ἐβιάσαντο ἀποσταλῆναι, διδόναι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐν Ἀμφικτύοσιν εἴων λόγον.	Never before had Greeks been so treated, for not even the most powerful of the Macedonians, Philip, the son of Amyntas, and Alexander, despatched by force to Macedonia the Greeks who were opposed to them, but allowed them to plead their case before the Amphictyons.
ἔδοξε τῷ Τιμολέοντι καὶ τοῖς Συρακουσίοις γράψαι πρὸς τοὺς Κορινθίους ὅπως πέμψωσιν οἰκήτορας εἰς τὰς Συρακούσας ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος,	Therefore Timoleon and the Syracusans decided to write to the Corinthians urging them to send settlers to Syracuse from Greece.
ἀπόδος μοι τὴν ἀγαλλίασιν τοῦ σωτηρίου σου. καὶ πνεύματι ἡγεμονικῷ στήρισόν με.	Give me back the gladness of your salvation, strengthen me with your governing spirit.
πῶς ὑμεῖς παιδεύειν θέλετε τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς κυρίου, αὐτοὶ μὴ ἔχοντες παιδείαν;	How will you correct the chosen of the Lord if you yourselves suffer no correction?
ταύτην, ὡς ἔοικε, κομιδῆ νέον ὄντα τὸν Δημήτριον ἔπειθεν ὁ πατήρ, οὐκ οὖσαν αὐτῷ καθ’ ὥραν, ἀλλὰ πρεσβυτέραν, λαβεῖν·	This woman, as it would appear, his father had persuaded Demetrius to marry when he was quite young, although she was not of his age, but older
οἱ γὰρ ἐκ τῆς συντήξιος ἰχῶρες τῶν ἁλῶν εἰσι ἀδηκτότεροι.	for the brine which runs from the melting of the salts is less stimulant than the salts themselves.
μή μἀποδείρῃς.	you'll not flay anything.
εἶτα νῦν ἐξηπάτησεν ἡ χάραξ τὴν ἄμπελον. ἰὼ χελῶναι μακάριαι τοῦ δέρματος, καὶ τρὶς μακάριαι τοῦ ᾽ πὶ ταῖς πλευραῖς τέγους. ὡς εὖ κατηρέψασθε καὶ νουβυστικῶς κεράμῳ τὸ νῶτον ὥστε τὰς πληγὰς στέγειν.	but now, look! the prop is deceiving the vine! xanthias enters, weeping and wailing and rubbing his sides. oh! tortoises! happy to have so hard a skin! oh! creatures full of sense! what a happy thought to cover your bodies with this shell, which shields it from blows! as for me, i can no longer move;
σὲ τὸν σοφιστήν, τὸν πικρῶς ὑπέρπικρον, τὸν ἐξαμαρτόντ᾽ εἰς θεοὺς ἐφημέροις πορόντα τιμάς, τὸν πυρὸς κλέπτην λέγω·	enter hermes to you, the clever and crafty, bitter beyond all bitterness, who has sinned against the gods in bestowing honors upon creatures of a day - to you, thief of fire, i speak.
καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ Ἀναβήσῃ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν εἰς Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαὰδ εἰς πόλεμον; καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφάτ Καθὼς ἐγώ, καὶ σὺ οὕτως, καθὼς ὁ λαός μου ὁ λαός σου, καθὼς οἱ ἵπποι μου οἱ ἵπποι σου.	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go up with me to Ramoth-gilead for a battle?” Jehoshaphat said, “Just as I am, so are you. Just as my people are, so are your people. Just as my horses are, so are your horses.”
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι ὡς ἐπὶ ἀπροσδοκήτῳ εὐπραγίᾳ πάλιν αὖ ἀναρρωσθέντες, ὥσπερ καὶ πρότερον, ἐς μὲν Ἀκράγαντα στασιάζοντα πέντε καὶ δέκα ναυσὶ Σικανὸν ἀπέστειλαν, ὅπως ὑπαγάγοιτο τὴν πόλιν, εἰ δύναιτο·	After this the Syracusans, recovering their old confidence at such an unexpected stroke of good fortune, despatched Sicanus with fifteen ships to Agrigentum where there was a revolution, to induce if possible the city to join them
ἐν δὲ τῇ Σπαρτιατῶν οὐδεὶς ἂν ἐπιδείξειεν οὔτε στάσιν οὔτε σφαγὰς οὔτε φυγὰς ἀνόμους γεγενημένας, οὐδ’ ἁρπαγὰς χρημάτων οὐδ’ αἰσχύνας γυναικῶν καὶ παίδων, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ πολιτείας μεταβολὴν οὐδὲ χρεῶν ἀποκοπὰς οὐδὲ γῆς ἀναδασμὸν οὐδ’ ἄλλ’ οὐδὲν τῶν ἀνηκέστων κακῶν.	whereas in the city of the Spartans no one can show an instance of civil faction or slaughter or unlawful exile, nor of seizure of property or outrage to women and children, nor even of revolution or abolition of debts or redistribution of lands, nor of any other of the irreparable ills.
ἐπειδὴ δεῖ τόδε ὑγιαίνειν, ἀνάγκη τοδὶ ὑπάρξαι, εἰ ἔσται ἐκεῖνο, ὥσπερ ἐκεῖ, εἰ ἔστι τὸ τρίγωνον δύο ὀρθαί, ἀνάγκη τοδὶ εἶναι.	since it is required that so - and - so is to be in good health, if that is to be secured it is necessary for such - and - such a thing to be provided - just as in mathematics, if the angles of a triangle are together equal to two right angles, such and such a consequence necessarily follows.
μανθάνω, ἦ δ’ ὅς.	I understand, said he.
ἔρρωσθε ἐν Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ, ὑποτασσόμενοι τῷ ἐπισκόπῳ ὡς τῇ ἐντολῇ, ὁμοίως καὶ τῷ πρεσβυτερίῳ. καὶ οἱ κατ̓ ἄνδρα ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶτε ἐν ἀμερίστῳ καρδίᾳ.	Farewell in Jesus Christ. Submit yourselves to the bishop as to the commandment, and likewise to the presbytery. Let each of you individually love one another with an undivided heart.
ἔνθα ὄντι αὐτῷ τὸν μὲν ἄλλον χρόνον εἰσεβάλλοντο πρόβατα καὶ αἶγας, καὶ ἔζη σιτούμενος·	They regularly threw sheep and goats down to him and he survived by eating them.
καὶ τοῖς μὲν ἐκ πάντων δοκεῖ τούτων, τοῖς δ᾽ ἐκ δυοῖν, τοῖς δ᾽ ἐν ἑνί τινι τούτων εἶναι τὸ ζῆν εὐδαιμόνως.	and some think that the happy life comes from them all, others from two of them, others that it consists in some one of them.
νῦν δέ, ὅτε ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐκείνοις ἡμαρτημένων τὸ πλῆθος κακῶς ποιεῖν ἠξίουν, ἠγανακτεῖτε, ἡγούμενοι δεινὸν εἶναι τὰ τῶν ὀλίγων ἀδικήματα πάσῃ τῇ πόλει κοινὰ γίγνεσθαι.	for you considered it monstrous that the crimes of the few should be spread over the whole city.
καὶ συνήχθη Ἰούδας ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν κύριον, καὶ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδας ἦλθον ζητῆσαι τὸν κύριον.	Judah gathered to seek out the Lord, and they came to seek the Lord from all the cities of Judah.
κἄπειτα ὁ πατὴρ καταστήσας ἐγγυητὰς ἐγράψατο τὸν Σπεύσιππον παρανόμων, καὶ ἠγωνίσατο ἐν ἑξακισχιλίοις Ἀθηναίων, καὶ μετέλαβε δικαστῶν τοσούτων οὐδὲ διακοσίας ψήφους ὁ Σπεύσιππος.	whereupon my father furnished surieties and brought an action against speusippus for making an illegal proposal. the case was tried before six thousand citizens. there were six thousand jurors, i repeat; yet speusippus failed to gall the votes of two hundred.
ὥστε δοῦναι ἑνὶ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν σαρκῶν τῶν τέκνων αὐτοῦ ὧν ἂν κατέσθῃ, διὰ τὸ μὴ καταλιφθῆναι αὐτῷ οὐδὲν ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ σου καὶ ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου ᾗ ἂν θλίψωσίν σε οἱ ἐχθροί σου ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσίν σου.	so as to give one of them from the flesh of his young children whom he may be devouring, because there was nothing left behind for him in your distress and in your oppression that your enemies afflicted you in all your cities.
εἴπερ δίκαιον παρὰ θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι τοῖς θλίβουσιν ὑμᾶς θλίψιν,	since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you,
ἐὰν οὕτως εἴπῃ Τὰ ποικίλα ἔσται σου μισθός, καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα ποικίλα· ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ Τὰ λευκὰ ἔσται σου μισθός, καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα λευκά·	If thus he says, ‘The spotted ones will be your wage,’ then all the sheep will bear spotted ones. If he says, ‘The white ones will be your wage,’ then all the sheep will bear white ones.
οἱ δὲ εἶναι καὶ τὴν Ἀλαλκομενίαν τῶν Ὠγύγου θυγατέρων φασίν.	others declare that Alalcomenia was one of the daughters of Ogygus.
περὶ δὲ τῆς γῆς ἴσως Αἰσχύλος ὑμᾶς πέπεικεν, ὡς ὁ Ἄτλας ἕστηκε, κίον’ οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ χθονὸς ὤμοις ἐρείδων, ἄχθος οὐκ εὐάγκαλον εἰ τῇ μὲν σελήνῃ κοῦφος ἀὴρ ὑποτρέχει καὶ στερεὸν ὄγκον οὐκ ἐχέγγυος ἐνεγκεῖν, τὴν δὲ γῆν κατὰ Πίνδαρον ἀδαμαντοπέδιλοι κίονες περιέχουσι·	but as for the earth, Aeschylus has secured you, when he says that Atlas Stands shouldering the pillar of the heaven and earth, A burden onerous.
ἀλλὰ νῦν μὲν περὶ τούτου καιρός ἐστι γνῶναι τὰ δίκαια, ἕτερος δὲ ἥξει Κηφισίῳ καὶ ἡμῶν ἑκάστῳ, ὧν οὗτος νῦν μεμνήσεται.	Now is the moment for a just sentence upon this man another time will come for Cephisius, and for each of us whom he will now proceed to cite.
κυρωθέντων δὲ τούτων, εἵλοντο σφῶν αὐτῶν οἱ πεντακισχίλιοι τοὺς ἀναγράψοντας τὴν πολιτείαν ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας.	and these being ratified, the five thousand elected a hundred of their members as a committee to draw up the constitution.
τὸν δ’ ἐν Οὐλύμπῳ φάτναι Ζηνὸς ἀρχαῖαι δέκονται.	but Pegasus has found his shelter in the ancient stables of Zeus in Olympus, But I, while casting the whirling javelins with straight aim, must not miss the mark as I speed many shafts with the strength of my hands.
κλέπτων δὲ θυμῷ δεῖμα προσέννεπε·	But he hid his fear in his heart and said
ἐπειδὴ δὲ αὐτοῖς ἀλληλοφθοριῶν διαφυγὰς ἐπήρκεσε, πρὸς τὰς ἐκ Διὸς ὥρας εὐμάρειαν ἐμηχανᾶτο ἀμφιεννὺς αὐτὰ πυκναῖς τε θριξὶν καὶ στερεοῖς δέρμασιν, ἱκανοῖς μὲν ἀμῦναι χειμῶνα, δυνατοῖς δὲ καὶ καύματα, καὶ εἰς εὐνὰς ἰοῦσιν ὅπως ὑπάρχοι τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα στρωμνὴ οἰκεία τε καὶ αὐτοφυὴς ἑκάστῳ·	and when he had equipped them with avoidances of mutual destruction, he devised a provision against the seasons ordained by Heaven, in clothing them about with thick-set hair and solid hides, sufficient to ward off winter yet able to shield them also from the heats, and so that on going to their lairs they might find in these same things a bedding of their own that was native to each
ἀλλ᾽ ὦ μέλ᾽ οὐκ οἶσθ᾽ οἷος ἦσθ᾽ αὐτὸς πάρος, οὐδ᾽ οἷ᾽ ἔδρας· ἐμὲ γὰρ νομίζοις ἂν θεόν. τί δ᾽ ἔδρων, κάτειπέ μοι, πρὸ τοῦ;	if you but remembered what you were formerly and what you did, you would for a certainty believe me to be a god.
μετὰ δὲ τούτους ἕτεροι παρῆσαν εἰς τάξιν ἤδη καθίστασθαι τοὺς πρώτους λέγοντες, ὁ μὲν οὖν Καῖσαρ εἰπὼν τὴν προσδοκωμένην ἥκειν ἡμέραν, ἐν ᾗ πρὸς ἄνδρας, οὐ πρὸς λιμὸν οὐδὲ πενίαν μαχοῦνται, κατὰ τάχος πρὸ τῆς σκηνῆς ἐκέλευσε προθεῖναι τὸν φοινικοῦν χιτῶνα· τοῦτο γὰρ μάχης Ῥωμαίοις ἐστὶ σύμβολον.	After these, others came announcing that the foremost ranks were already forming in battle array. Caesar, therefore, after saying that the expected day had come, on which they would fight against men, and not against want and hunger, quickly ordered the purple tunic to be hung up in front of his tent, that being the Roman signal for battle.
σὺ τοί νιν οἶσθα διαπερῶν σὺ δ’ οὐδὲν ὕστερος μαθών ἐπεὶ κατῆλθες ἐς πόλιν, δορός γε τῷδ’ ἀντηρέτας.	Now you know of the Erinys by experience— And you are made aware no later— When you came back to our city, Yes, to face him with your spear.
ἐδόκει γὰρ τοῦτο μόνον ἐν τῇ πόλει οὔπω γεγενῆσθαι.	it's the one and only innovation that has not yet been tried at athens.
τῇσι δ’ ἐνὶ Κνωσσός, μεγάλη πόλις, ἔνθα τε Μίνως ἐννέωρος βασίλευε Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής.	—Cnossus too, great city, among them, where Minos for nine yearsRuled as king, and enjoyed familiar converse with great Zeus.
οὗτος τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν φέρει καὶ περὶ ἡμῶν ὀδυνᾶται, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐλογισάμεθα αὐτὸν εἶναι ἐν πόνῳ καὶ ἐν πληγῇ καὶ ἐν κακώσει.	This one carries our sins and suffers pain for us, and we regarded him ⌊as one who is in difficulty, misfortune, and affliction⌋.
Σπούδασον σεαυτὸν δόκιμον παραστῆσαι τῷ θεῷ, ἐργάτην ἀνεπαίσχυντον, ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας.	Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
καὶ ὁ Καῖσαρ ὧδε ἔχοντι ἐξ Ἱππωνείου ἐπιδραμὼν ἐπιφαίνεται κατὰ τὸ Σκυλάκιον, καὶ τὴν εὐταξίαν ἀποδεξάμενος ἐπανῆλθεν ἐς τὸ Ἱππώνειον.	While he was making this movement Octavius, who had advanced from Vibo, made his appearance near Scylacium, and, after giving his approval to the good order of the forces, returned to Vibo.
ἐς δὲ τὴν θάλασσαν ἐμβάντες ᾗ μή τις ἂν προσεδόκησεν, οἱ μὲν ἄχρι τῶν μαστῶν βρεχόμενοι διεβάδιζον, οἱ δὲ καὶ διένεον, ἕως ἐπὶ τὰ μηχανήματα ἐλθόντες ἐξῆψαν τὸ πῦρ, καὶ κατάφωροι γενόμενοι πολλὰ μὲν ἔπαθον, ἅτε γυμνοὶ τιτρωσκόμενοι, πολλὰ δ’ ἀντέδρασαν ὑπὸ τόλμης·	When they reached the engines they lighted their torches, and becoming visible and being naked they suffered greatly from wounds, which they courageously returned.
εἰ δὲ μὴ βούλει, εἴ σοι φίλον, ἐῶ χαίρειν.	but if you would rather not, to suit your wishes I will let it pass.
ἐρωτηθεὶς τί ἄθλιον ἐν βίῳ, ἔφη, γέρων ἄπορος.	To the question what is wretched in life he replied, An old man destitute.
οἱ γὰρ πλεῖστοι ταχέως ἀνέφυγον πρὸς τὴν φάλαγγα.	for the greater part of them fled swiftly hack to the main body.
Καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἡμέρας τεσσαράκοντα πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ, καὶ ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων, καὶ οἱ ἄγγελοι διηκόνουν αὐτῷ.	And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to Him.
χρήματα δ’ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον αὐτῷ τά τε κοινὰ πάντα αὐτίκα ἐψηφίζοντο καὶ τὰ ἰδιωτικὰ σφῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς κοινοῖς, εἰ δεήσειεν, εἶναι στρατιωτικά·	They voted him for the war all the money in the public treasury at once, and their own private fortunes in addition if they should be needed for the pay of the soldiers.
ὁ δὲ Καῖσαρ, οὐ σχολὴν ἄγων περὶ μικρὰ τρίβεσθαι τοσῶνδε πολέμων αὐτὸν περιμενόντων, ἐς τὴν Ἀσίαν μετῆλθε καὶ παροδεύων αὐτὴν ἐχρημάτιζε ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐνοχλουμέναις ὑπὸ τῶν μισθουμένων τοὺς φόρους, ὥς μοι κατὰ τὴν Ἀσιανὴν συγγραφὴν δεδήλωται.	As Caesar had no time to waste on small matters while such great wars were still unfinished elsewhere, he returned to the province of Asia and while passing through it transacted public business in the cities, which were oppressed by the farmers of the revenue, as I have shown in my Asiatic history.
αὐτὸ γὰρ δὴ τὸ τοῦ σώματος ἐξόζειν αὐτὰ τῆς κοιλίας ἐστὶ τὸ πεπέφθαι.	For of course the mere fact that the food smells of the body shows that it has undergone gastric digestion.
διὸ καὶ πατρικήν τινα πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ παλαιοῦ διετέλουν εὐθὺς οἱ βασιλεῖς φιλονεικίαν καὶ διαφορὰν παραλαμβάνοντες.	Therefore from the outset, and from generation to generation, the kings were traditionally at feud and variance with them.
ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ποιῶν τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου ἀμελῶς, ἐξαίρων μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾽ αἵματος.	Cursed be the one who does the works of the Lord carelessly, lifting up his sword from blood.
ἐπὶ μᾶλλον δὲ ὑπνωτικὸν μήκων ἀφεψηθεῖσα ἐν λίπαϊ, ἔς τε τὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς βρέγμα, ἢ ὕδατι ἐς τὸ πρόσωπον ξὺν σπογγιῇ·	first, by fomentations to the head, with unmixed rose-oil, or oil of marjoram with the juice of ivy, or the decoction of wild thyme or of melilot.
Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ τότε, ὡς ἐπεκράτησαν τῆς Μεσσηνίας, τὴν μὲν ἄλλην πλὴν τῆς Ἀσιναίων αὐτοὶ διελάγχανον, Μοθώνην δὲ Ναυπλιεῦσιν ἐδίδοσαν ἐκπεπτωκόσιν ἐκ Ναυπλίας ἔναγχος ὑπὸ Ἀργείων.	Now the Lacedaemonians, gaining possession of Messenia, divided it all among themselves, except the land belonging to the people of Asine; but they gave Mothone to the men of Nauplia, who had recently been driven from their town by the Argives.
ἁπτόμενος τοῦ Παρθικοῦ πολέμου ἔπεμψε πρὸς αὐτήν, κελεύων εἰς Κιλικίαν ἀπαντῆσαι λόγον ὑφέξουσαν ὧν ἐνεκαλεῖτο τοῖς περὶ Κάσσιον δοῦναι πολλὰ καὶ συμβαλέσθαι πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον.	As he was getting ready for the Parthian war, he sent to Cleopatra, ordering her to meet him in Cilicia in order to make answer to the charges made against her of raising and giving to Cassius much money for the war.
καὶ τάδε μὲν ἦν ἀμφὶ τὴν Ἰταλίαν, Κάρβωνα δ’ ἐκ Λιβύης ἐς Σικελίαν μετὰ πολλῶν ἐπιφανῶν καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῆς ἐς Κοσσύραν νῆσον ὑποφεύγοντα πέμψας τινὰς ὁ Πομπήιος συνέλαβε.	While the affairs of Italy were in this state, Pompey sent a force and captured Carbo, who had fled with many persons of distinction from Africa to Sicily and thence to the island of Cossyra.
καίτοι διαιρεῖται καὶ ὁ κύκλος εἰς τὰ τμήματα ὥσπερ καὶ ἡ συλλαβὴ εἰς τὰ στοιχεῖα.	except accidentally, inasmuch as the bronze sphere is a sphere, and he makes the former.
μετέσχον δὲ καὶ τοῦ ἐς Σικελίαν στόλου κατὰ Ἀθηναίων φιλίαν.	Their friendship with the Athenians led them to take part also in the Sicilian expedition.
τούς τε τῷ Καίσαρι κιχραμένους ἐκ τῶν ἱερῶν χρημάτων ἐκβάλλοντες ἐκ τῶν πόλεων ἢ ἀναιροῦντες, τὰ τείχη σφῶν διὰ χειρὸς εἶχον καὶ πρὸς τὸν Λεύκιον ἐχώρουν.	On the other hand, the colonized soldiers joined Octavius.
ἡγοῦμαι γὰρ καὶ ταύτην ἀριστεῖον αὐτὸν λαβεῖν.	and I believe that in her he also won a glorious prize of valor.
σὺ δὲ ὄρθριζε πρὸς Κύριον Παντοκράτορα δεόμενος.	But you rise early to implore of the Lord Almighty.
συλλαβὼν δὲ αὐτὸν κοιμώμενον καὶ παντοίας ἐναλλάσσοντα μορφὰς ἔδησε, καὶ οὐκ ἔλυσε πρὶν ἢ μαθεῖν παρ’ αὐτοῦ ποῦ τυγχάνοιεν τὰ μῆλα καὶ αἱ Ἑσπερίδες.	They revealed Nereus to him, and Hercules seized him while he slept, and though the god turned himself into all kinds of shapes, the hero bound him and did not release him till he had learned from him where were the apples and the Hesperides.
ἀπέχου τῶν σαρκικῶν καὶ σωματικῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν· ἐὰν τίς σοι δῷ ῥάπισμα εἰς τὴν δεξιὰν σιαγόνα, στέψον αὐτῷ καὶ τὴν ἄλλην, καὶ ἔσῃ τέλειος· ἐὰν ἀγγαρεύσῃ σέ τις μίλιον ἕν, ὕπαγε μετ’ αυτοῦ δύο· ἐὰν ἄρῃ τις τὸ ἱμάτιόν σου, δὸς αὐτῳ καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα· ἐὰν λάβῃ τις ἀπὸ σοῦ τὸ σόν, μὴ ἀπαίτει· οὐδὲ γὰρ δύνασαι.	Abstain from fleshly and worldly lusts. If someone strikes your right cheek, turn to him the other also, and you shall be perfect. If someone impresses you for one mile, go with him two. If someone takes your cloak, give him also your coat. If someone takes from you what is yours, ask it not back, for indeed you are not able.
καὶ ἐχάρη ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας, καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθὰ καὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου καὶ τῆς στακτῆς καὶ τῶν θυμιαμάτων καὶ τοῦ μύρου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν σκευῶν τῆς γάζης, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐθὲν ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξεν Ἑζεκίας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.	And Hezekiah rejoiced at them, and he showed them the house of the Nechotha and of the silver and of the gold and of the myrrh and of the incenses and of the perfume and all the houses of the vessels of the treasure and all that were in his storehouses, and there was nothing in his house that Hezekiah did not show.
τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν οἷς ἔδωκας ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἐν ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν· καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ σώματα ἡμῶν ἐξουσιάζουσιν καὶ ἐν κτήνεσιν ἡμῶν ὡς ἀρεστὸν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐν θλίψει μεγάλῃ ἐσμέν.	belongs to the kings whom you gave over us in our sins, and they exercise authority over our bodies and over our animals as is acceptable to them, and we are in great affliction.”
καὶ ταύταις ἐποίησεν μηχανήματα περιθεὶς στύλους μεγάλους, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ τοῖς στύλοις πανοπλίας εἰς ὄνομα αἰώνιον, καὶ παρὰ ταῖς πανοπλίαις πλοῖα ἐπιγεγλυμμένα, εἰς τὸ θεωρεῖσθαι ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν πλεόντων τὴν θάλασσαν.	And for these, he built an elaborate setting placed around the large pillars, and he built over the pillars suits of armor to be an enduring memorial, and beside the armor engraved ships for observance by all who sail the sea.
καὶ ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου Ἀαρών, καὶ ἐξαρεῖ Ἀαρὼν τὰ ἁμαρτήματα τῶν ἁγίων ὅσα ἂν ἁγιάσωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, παντὸς δόματος τῶν ἁγίων αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου Ἀαρὼν διὰ παντός, δεκτὸν αὐτοῖς ἔναντι Κυρίου.	And it will be upon the forehead of Aaron, and Aaron will bear away the sin concerning the holy things that the children of Israel may set aside for any gift of their holy things. And so it will be upon the forehead of Aaron at all times, acceptable on their behalf in the presence of the Lord.
νῦν οὖν με πρῶτον πρὶν λέγειν ἐάσατε ἐνσκευάσασθαί μ᾽ οἷον ἀθλιώτατον.	permit me, therefore, before i speak, to dress in the manner most likely to draw pity.
ἀλλ’, ὦ ἄνδρες, οἶμαι καὶ ὑμᾶς εἰδέναι ὅτι οἱ μὴ τὰ δίκαια πράττοντες οὐχ ὁμολογοῦσι τοὺς ἐχθροὺς λέγειν ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ’ αὐτοὶ ψευδόμενοι καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα μηχανώμενοι ὀργὰς τοῖς ἀκούουσι κατὰ τῶν τὰ δίκαια πραττόντων παρασκευάζουσι.	But, sirs, I think you know as well as I that those whose acts are against justice do not acknowledge that their enemies speak the truth, but lie themselves and use other such devices to foment anger in their hearers against those whose acts are just.
ὥστε καὶ διάνοιαί τινες καὶ πάθη οὐκ ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰσίν, ἢ πράξεις αἱ κατὰ τὰς τοιαύτας διανοίας καὶ λογισμούς, ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ Φιλόλαος ἔφη εἶναί τινας λόγους κρείττους ἡμῶν.	so that some thoughts and emotions, or the actions that are guided by such thoughts and calculations, do not rest with ourselves, but it is as philolaus said -' some arguments are too strong for us.'
καὶ τοῦτο θαυμαστὸν οὐκ ἔστιν, εἴγε δὴ καὶ μὴ παρόντας αἰδοῦνται μᾶλλον ἑτέρων παρόντων, ὡς ἐκεῖνος ὁ τοῦ πολεμίου κείμενον αὑτὸν ἐπισφάττειν μέλλοντος δεόμενος καὶ ἀντιβολῶν διὰ τοῦ στέρνου διεῖναι τὸ ξίφος, ὅπως, ἔφη, μή με νεκρὸν ὁ ἐρώμενος ὁρῶν κατὰ νώτου τετρωμένον αἰσχυνθῇ.	Nor is this a wonder since men have more regard for their lovers even when absent than for others who are present, as was true of him who, when his enemy was about to slay him where he lay, earnestly besought him to run his sword through his breast, in order, as he said, that my beloved may not have to blush at sight of my body with a wound in the back.
Οὐρίατθος ὲν ἐπὶ θάτερα τῆς Ἰβηρίας ἑτέρῳ στρατηγῷ Ῥωμαιων Κοϊντίῳ συνεπλέκετο, καὶ ἡσσώμενος ἐς τὸ Ἀφροδίσιον ὄρος ἀνέστρεφεν.	From this he sallied and slew 1000 of Quintus' men and captured some standards from them and drove the rest into their camp.
τοῦτ’ οὖν αὔτ’ ἤδη δραστέον, καὶ μελλητέον οὐδὲν ἔτι.	This, then, I must at once proceed to do, and procrastinate no longer.
ταῦτα γὰρ οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅθεν συναγαγὼν ὥσπερ χολὴν τἀνδρὶ προσβέβληκε, πάντῃ μὲν ἴσως οὐκ ἀνεπιλήπτῳ, φρόνημα δ’ εὐγενὲς ἔχοντι καὶ ψυχὴν φιλότιμον, οἷς οὐδὲν ἐμφύεται πάθος ὠμὸν οὕτω καὶ θηριῶδες.	These charges he has raked up from some source or other and hurled them, as if so much venom, against one who was perhaps not in all points irreproachable, but who had a noble disposition and an ambitious spirit, wherein no such savage and bestial feelings can have their abode.
Λακεδαιμονίοις γὰρ Σπάρτης μὲν γυναικὸς εἰκών ἐστιν ἐν Ἀμύκλαις, Σπάρτωνα δὲ Φορωνέως παῖδα θαυμάζοιεν ἂν καὶ ἀρχὴν ἀκούσαντες.	For the Lacedaemonians have at Amyclae a portrait statue of a woman named Sparte, but they would be amazed at the mere mention of a Sparton, son of Phoroneus.
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ δειπνεῖς κατὰ τὸν ἐν πεττοῖς νόμον.	but it's not according to the rules of draughts that you take your seat at the banquet.
ἔπειτα τῶν ὅρων, οἵπερ ἦσαν τοῖς ὁδηγοῖς, συγχυθέντων καὶ πλάνης οὔσης καὶ διασπασμοῦ τῶν βαδιζόντων διὰ τὴν ἄγνοιαν, κόρακες ἐκφανέντες ὑπελάμβανον τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τῆς πορείας, ἑπομένων μὲν ἔμπροσθεν πετόμενοι καὶ σπεύδοντες, ὑστεροῦντας δὲ καὶ βραδύνοντας ἀναμένοντες·	Again, when the marks for the guides became confused, and the travellers were separated and wandered about in ignorance of the route, ravens appeared and assumed direction of their march, flying swiftly on in front of them when they followed, and waiting for them when they marched slowly and lagged behind.
ὃς δύο ἔτη ἐγεώργησεν, οὔτε ἰδίαν ἐλάαν οὔτε μορίαν οὔτε σηκὸν παραλαβών.	he cultivated it for two years, and had taken over no olive-tree, either private or sacred, nor any olive-stump.
τῶν τε νομισμάτων τὴν καταλλαγὴν ἀπέδοντο μιᾷ τραπέζῃ, ἑτέρῳ δὲ οὐκ ἦν οὐθενὶ οὔτε ἀποδόσθαι ἑτέρῳ οὔτε πρίασθαι παρ᾽ ἑτέρου· εἰ δὲ μή, στέρησις ἦν.	the right of changing money they sold to a single bank, whose proprietor was given a monopoly of the sale and purchase of coin, protected under penalty of confiscation.
διὰ τοῦτο ἀμφιβαλεῖ τὸ ἀμφίβληστρον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διὰ παντὸς ἀποκτέννειν ἔθνη οὐ φείσεται.	On account of this he will cast his net and continually will not refrain from killing nations.
τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἀπ’ οὐδεμιᾶς προφάσεως, ἀλλ’ ἐξαίφνης ὑγιεῖς ὄντας πρῶτον μὲν τῆς κεφαλῆς θέρμαι ἰσχυραὶ καὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἐρυθήματα καὶ φλόγωσις ἐλάμβανε, καὶ τὰ ἐντός, ἥ τε φάρυγξ καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα, εὐθὺς αἱματώδη ἦν καὶ πνεῦμα ἄτοπον καὶ δυσῶδες ἠφίει·	As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and redness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath.
ἔπεμψε δὲ καὶ Περδίκκας κρύφα τῶν Ἀθηναίων χιλίους Μακεδόνων, οἳ ὕστερον ἦλθον.	There were also a thousand Macedonians sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge of the Athenians, but they arrived too late.
καὶ ὁ λυτρούμενος αὐτοὺς ἰσχυρός, Κύριος Παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ· κρίσιν κρινεῖ πρὸς τοὺς ἀντιδίκους αὐτοῦ, ὅπως ἐξάρῃ τὴν γῆν καὶ παροξυνεῖ τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Βαβυλῶνα.	And he who redeems them is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name. He will judge with judgment against his adversaries, so that he might lift the land up and sharpen at those who dwell in Babylon
Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ τεσσερακοστῷ καὶ τετρακοσιοστῷ ἔτει τῆς ἐξόδου υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ ἐν μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ βασιλεύοντος τοῦ βασιλέως Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ,	It happened in the four hundred and fortieth year of the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, in the fourth year at the second month of the rule of King Solomon over Israel,
Καί ποτε δὴ καὶ Ἀθήνησιν ἐν τῷ Πειραιεῖ πρὸς τὰς θέσεις λέγων ἐχρόνισεν, οἰκείως ἔχων πρὸς Ἱεροκλέα· ἐφ’ ᾧ καὶ πρός τινων διεβάλλετο.	Once indeed, when at Athens, he stopped too long in the Piraeus, discussing themes, out of friendship for Hierocles, and for this he was censured by certain persons.
οὗτοι ἐπίκλητοι τῆς συναγωγῆς, ἄρχοντες τῶν φυλῶν κατὰ πατριάς, χιλίαρχοι Ἰσραήλ εἰσιν.	These are the persons called upon from the congregation, leaders of the tribes according to paternal lines; they are leaders of thousands in Israel.
ἦγον δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι Θεσσαλῶν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκ Λαρίσης Νικονίδας Περδίκκᾳ ἐπιτήδειος ὤν. τὴν γὰρ Θεσσαλίαν ἄλλως τε οὐκ εὔπορον ἦν διιέναι ἄνευ ἀγωγοῦ καὶ μετὰ ὅπλων γε δή, καὶ τοῖς πᾶσί γε ὁμοίως Ἕλλησιν ὕποπτον καθειστήκει τὴν τῶν πέλας μὴ πείσαντας διιέναι· τοῖς τε Ἀθηναίοις αἰεί ποτε τὸ πλῆθος τῶν Θεσσαλῶν εὔνουν ὑπῆρχεν.	being accompanied also by other Thessalians, among whom was Niconidas from Larissa, a friend of Perdiccas. It was never very easy to traverse Thessaly without an escort; and throughout all Hellas for an armed force to pass without leave through a neighbour's country, was a delicate step to take. Besides this the Thessalian people had always sympathized with the Athenians.
οἱ δὲ τούς τε ἐκβληθέντας ὑπὸ Ἀχαιῶν κατάγουσιν ἐς Σπάρτην καὶ ὅσων πρὸ κρίσεως ἀπελθόντων κατέγνωστο ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ἀδικεῖν, καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις τιμήματα ἔλυσαν·	This commission restored to Sparta those whom the Achaeans had exiled, and they remitted the penalties inflicted by the Achaeans on those who had fled before their trial and had been condemned in their absence.
ὁ δ’ Ἀριστείδης ὥρκισε μὲν τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ ὤμοσεν ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἀθηναίων, μύδρους ἐμβαλὼν ἐπὶ ταῖς ἀραῖς εἰς τὴν θάλατταν, ὕστερον δὲ τῶν πραγμάτων ἄρχειν ἐγκρατέστερον, ὡς ἔοικεν, ἐκβιαζομένων ἐκέλευε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὴν ἐπιορκίαν τρέψαντας εἰς ἑαυτὸν ᾗ συμφέρει χρῆσθαι τοῖς πράγμασι.	Aristides did, indeed, bind the Hellenes by an oath, and took oath himself for the Athenians, to mark his imprecations casting iron ingots into the sea; but afterwards, when circumstances, forsooth, compelled a more strenuous sway, he bade the Athenians lay the perjury to his own charge, and turn events to their own advantage.
καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἄγγελος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠλειοὺ καὶ εἶπεν Κατάβηθι μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀνέστη Ἠλειοὺ καὶ κατέβη μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.	The angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah and said, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of their face.” Elijah arose and went down with him to the king.
Οἱ δὲ ὄχλοι γνόντες ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ· καὶ δεξάμενος αὐτούς, ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς περὶ τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ τοὺς χρείαν ἔχοντας θεραπείας ἰᾶτο.	But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.
εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼ τότε μὴ παρηκολούθησα χρηστὴ καὶ φιλάνθρωπος, ἀλλ’ ἀπέλιπον καὶ προηκάμην τὰ νήπια, σὺ πῶς ἂν ἐγένου καὶ πόθεν ἐξέλαμψας;	For if I had not relieved the infants in their distress by my bounty and humanity, if I had deserted and betrayed them when they lay naked and exposed, how could you have appeared with such lustre and splendor as now you do? If a she-wolf had not then lighted upon them, inflamed with the abundance and pressure of her milk, which wanted one to give food unto more than any food for herself
δύο δὲ αὖθις ἐξ Ἤλιδος, Ἀρχίδαμος τεθρίππῳ νενικηκὼς καὶ Ἐπέραστός ἐστιν ὁ Θεογόνου ὅπλου νίκην ἀνῃρημένος·	There are two more from Elis, Archidamus who was victorious with a four-horse chariot and Eperastus the son of Theogonus, victor in the race in armour.
ποιήσετε τὸν ἀμνόν, καὶ τὸ μαναὰ καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον ποιήσετε τὸ πρωί, ὁλοκαύτωμα διὰ παντός.	You shall prepare the lamb, and you shall prepare the manna and the oil early in the day, a burnt offering continually.” ’
Γέγονε καὶ Μένανδρος Διογένους μαθητής, ὁ ἐπικαλούμενος Δρυμός, θαυμαστὴς Ὁμήρου, καὶ Ἡγησίας Σινωπεὺς ὁ Κλοιὸς ἐπίκλην, καὶ Φιλίσκος ὁ Αἰγινήτης, ὡς προειρήκαμεν.	Amongst other pupils of Diogenes were Menander, who was nicknamed Drymus or Oakwood, a great admirer of Homer Hegesias of Sinope, nicknamed Dog-collar and Philiscus of Aegina mentioned above.
ἀποθανεῖν γὰρ καὶ ταύτην ἐν Μεγάροις.	for she too according to them died in Megara.
οὕτως ἀγαθόν ἐστι μετὰ τοῦ χρόνου βασανίζειν τὰ πράγματα.	Thus it is wise to let time help us in testing the truth of a matter. Perhaps the circumstances of Herodes' death will similarly come to light hereafter
τοῖς δὲ ὁσίοις σου μέγιστον ἦν φῶς. ὧν φωνὴν ἀκούοντες μορφὴν δὲ οὐχ ὁρῶντες, ὅτι μὲν οὖν κἀκεῖνοι ἐπεπόνθεισαν, ἐμακάριζον·	But there was the greatest light for your holy ones, whose voices they heard but whose forms they did not see; they counted them blessed because those people had suffered;
καὶ ἔπεσαν τῶν παρὰ Νικάνορος ὡς πεντακισχίλιοι ἄνδρες, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυείδ.	And there fell from those from Nicanor as much as five thousand men, and they fled to the city of David.
ἄχρι μὲν οὖν ἤλπιζον αὐτοὺς ἐκχεαμένους τὰ βέλη σχήσεσθαι μάχης ἢ συνάψειν εἰς χεῖράς, ἐκαρτέρουν·	Now as long as they had hopes that the enemy would exhaust their missiles and desist from battle or fight at close quarters, the Romans held out
τοῦ διδόντος χιόνα ὡσεὶ ἔριον, ὁμίχλην ὡσεὶ σποδὸν πάσσοντος·	who gives snow like wool, who sprinkles fog like ashes,
ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐξ ὕψους καὶ ἔλαβέν με, προσέλαβε ἐξ ὑδάτων πολλῶν.	He dispatched from the heights and took me; he drew me to himself from many waters.
ὀρθῶς ἄρ’ ἂν ἐξαιροῖμεν τοὺς θρήνους τῶν ὀνομαστῶν ἀνδρῶν, γυναιξὶ δὲ ἀποδιδοῖμεν, καὶ οὐδὲ ταύταις σπουδαίαις, καὶ ὅσοι κακοὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν, ἵνα ἡμῖν δυσχεραίνωσιν ὅμοια τούτοις ποιεῖν οὓς δή φαμεν ἐπὶ φυλακῇ τῆς χώρας τρέφειν.	Then we should be right in doing away with the lamentations of men of note and in attributing them to women, and not to the most worthy of them either, and to inferior men, in that those whom we say we are breeding for the guardianship of the land may disdain to act like these.
δεῖ οὖν ἡμᾶς ὡς ναὸν θεοῦ φυλάσσειν τὴν σάρκα:	We must therefore guard the flesh as a temple of God,
τοὺς δ’ ἐν Ἠπείρῳ μένειν ἐκέλευεν, ὡς ἂν ἐν κύκλῳ πάντας ἔχῃ, μέλλων αὐτὸς ἐν Ἀθήναις χειμάσειν.	Others he ordered to remain in Epirus, in order to have them all within reach, as he intended to pass the winter himself in Athens.
καὶ ἡγεμονίαν οὗτοι κατ’ ἀξίωμα εἶχον τὸ ἀρχαῖον.	Because of their ancient reputation the Athenians held the chief command.
Ὑποτάγητε οὖν πάσῃ ἀνθρωπίνῃ κτίσει διὰ τὸν κύριον· εἴτε βασιλεῖ, ὡς ὑπερέχοντι·	Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme,
καὶ δεινὸς ὢν ὑπελθεῖν ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ τοὺς κρείττονας, ὥσπερ ὑπερόπτης τῶν ταπεινοτέρων, κόσμιος δὲ καὶ σώφρων περὶ δίαιταν, ἐκ πολλῶν νέων ἡγεμονικῶν προεκρίθη λαβεῖν Ἀντιγόνην γυναῖκα τῶν Βερενίκης θυγατέρων, ἣν ἔσχεν ἐκ Φιλίππου πρὶν ἢ Πτολεμαίῳ συνοικεῖν.	He was adept at turning to his own advantage the favour of his superiors, just as he was inclined to look down upon his inferiors, and since he was orderly and restrained in his ways of living, he was selected from among many young princes as a husband for Antigone, one of the daughters of Berenicé, whom she had by Philip before her marriage with Ptolemy.
νόμος πάντων βασιλεύς.	Law is the king of all.
οὐκοῦν κοινὰ τά γε φίλων λέγεται, ὥστε τούτῳ γε οὐδὲν διοίσετον, εἴπερ ἀληθῆ περὶ τῆς φιλίας λέγετον.	And, you know, friends are said to have everything in common, so that here at least there will be no difference between you, if what you say of your friendship is true.
ἵνα ζήσῃ ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ χάρις ᾖ περὶ σῷ τραχήλῳ. [1] ἔσται δὲ ἴασις ταῖς σαρξί σου, καὶ ἐπιμέλεια τοῖς σοῖς ὀστέοις·	so that your soul may live and grace may be around your neck;
Καὶ ἐπάταξεν εἷς τις ἐξ αὐτῶν τὸν δοῦλον τοῦ ἀρχιερέως, καὶ ἀφεῖλεν αὐτοῦ τὸ οὖς τὸ δεξιόν.	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
γεγόνασι δὲ ὅμως καὶ ἄλλοι μάρτυρες αὐτῶν.	But there have been other witnesses to these facts.
Λίβων μὲν δὴ συνεὶς τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐνδιδόντων ἠξίου τοὺς ἡγεμόνας αὐτοὺς συνελθεῖν ὡς ἀλλήλοις ἐνδώσοντας, ὅ τι ἂν δοκῇ·	When Libo perceived that his enemies were on the point of yielding, he demanded that the leaders themselves should come together in order to make such concessions to each other as they could agree upon.
χαίρετ’ ἀστικὸς λεώς, ἴκταρ ἥμενοι Διός, παρθένου φίλας φίλοι σωφρονοῦντες ἐν χρόνῳ.	Farewell, people of the city, seated near to Zeus, the beloved of the beloved maiden, learning at last the way of wisdom.
ἐν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἢ ἐν τοῖς ἀρχομένοις;	In the rulers or in the ruled?
τῶν δ’ εἰπόντων ὑμῖν τἀναντία καὶ διὰ τέλους ἐν τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ ὄντων πολλοὶ ἀποπεφεύγασι.	And this man, who had neither proposed any motion nor sat in Council for more than eight days, was sentenced to pay that large sum, while many of those who had spoken in opposition to you, and had continued in Council throughout, have been acquitted.
πολὺ γὰρ δικαιότερα ἡμεῖς γέρα τοῖς περισώσασιν αὐτοὺς ἐκηρύξαμεν ὧν ἐκεῖνοι τοῖς ἀναιροῦσιν·	The triumvirs know that we, who killed Caesar because he assumed the monarchy, would not tolerate them in assuming his power and that we would not assume it ourselves, but that we would restore to the people in common the government as we received it from our ancestors.
τοῦτο δὲ οἱ Λιμνᾶται Σπαρτιατῶν καὶ Κυνοσουρεῖς καὶ οἱ ἐκ Μεσόας τε καὶ Πιτάνης θύοντες τῇ Ἀρτέμιδι ἐς διαφοράν, ἀπὸ δὲ αὐτῆς καὶ ἐς φόνους προήχθησαν, ἀποθανόντων δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ βωμῷ πολλῶν νόσος ἔφθειρε τοὺς λοιπούς.	Secondly, the Spartan Limnatians, the Cynosurians, and the people of Mesoa and Pitane, while sacrificing to Artemis, fell to quarreling, which led also to bloodshed many were killed at the altar and the rest died of disease.
καὶ οὐχὶ πορεύεσθε τοῖς νομίμοις τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς ἐξαποστέλλω ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν· ὅτι ταῦτα πάντα ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἐβδελυξάμην αὐτούς.	And you shall not conduct yourself according to the customs of those peoples whom I am expelling from your midst, because they did all these things, and so I abhorred them.
ἰδοὺ αἱ ἐπαύλεις ἡμῶν καὶ πᾶν πεδίον πυρῶν καὶ τὰ ποίμνια καὶ τὰ βουκόλια καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ μάνδραι τῶν σκηνῶν ἡμῶν παράκεινται πρὸ προσώπου σου, χρῆσαι καθ᾽ ὃ ἂν ἀρέσκῃ σοι·	Behold, our dwellings and fields of wheat and flocks and cattle and all sheep folds of our tents lie before your face; use them according to what would please you.
ἐξοπλασίαν ἐν τῷ Θησείῳ ποιησάμενος ἐκκλησιάζειν ἐπεχείρει, καὶ χρόνον προσηγόρευεν μικρόν, οὐ φασκόντων δὲ κατακούειν, ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοὺς προσαναβῆναι πρὸς τὸ πρόπυλον τῆς ἀκροπόλεως, ἵνα γεγωνῇ μᾶλλον.	he held an armed muster at the temple of theseus, and began to hold an assembly, but he lowered his voice a little, and when they said they could not hear him, he told them to come up to the forecourt of the acropolis, in order that his voice might carry better;
οἱ δὲ ἐς πολιορκίαν εὐτρεπίζοντο, πρότερον ἔτι τῆς Σπάρτης ἐπὶ τοῦ πολέμου τοῦ πρὸς Δημήτριον τάφροις τε βαθείαις καὶ σταυροῖς τετειχισμένης ἰσχυροῖς, τὰ δὲ ἐπιμαχώτατα καὶ οἰκοδομήμασιν.	The citizens prepared for a siege, and Sparta even before this in the war with Demetrius had been fortified with deep trenches and strong stakes, and at the most vulnerable points with buildings as well.
Μυκήνας δὲ Ἀργεῖοι καθεῖλον ὑπὸ ζηλοτυπίας.	It was jealousy which caused the Argives to destroy Mycenae.
ὁ δὲ κῆρυξ ὡς ἤκουσε καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι ἡ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως βοήθεια διέφθαρται, ἀνοιμώξας καὶ ἐκπλαγεὶς τῷ μεγέθει τῶν παρόντων κακῶν ἀπῆλθεν εὐθὺς ἄπρακτος καὶ οὐκέτι ἀπῄτει τοὺς νεκρούς.	When the herald heard this and knew that the reinforcement from the city had been destroyed, he broke into wailing, and stunned at the magnitude of the present evils, went away at once without having performed his errand, or again asking for the dead bodies.
ὥστε καὶ περὶ τῆς φιλίας οὐ δύνανται πάντ᾽ ἀποδιδόναι τὰ φαινόμενα.	hence in the case of friendship, they cannot take account of all the observed facts.
Πολυβώτης δὲ διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης διωχθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος ἧκεν εἰς Κῶ·	Polybotes was chased through the sea by Poseidon and came to Cos
καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀδδείν, Λάθος καὶ Μοοσσείσς, Λακκοῦνος καὶ Ναῖδος, καὶ Βεσκασπασμὺς καὶ Σεσθὴλ καὶ Βαλνοῦς καὶ Μανασσήας·	And of the sons of Eri: Naathus and Moossias and Laccunus and Naidus and Bescaspasmys and Sesthel and Belnuus and Manasseas.
Ἐπιτρέπω μὲν ἔγωγε Πρωταγόρᾳ ὁπότερον αὐτῷ ἥδιον·	But if he does not mind, let us talk no more of poems and verses, but consider the points on which I questioned you at first, Protagoras, and on which I should be glad to reach, with your help, a conclusion.
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ τοῦ ἑνός γε μετέχει τὰ μὴ ἕν·	But neither can the not one partake of the one
ἀνθρώπων γὰρ οἱ μὲν εὐπειθέστεροι πείθονται πᾶσι τοῖς λεγομένοις, ὡς ἀνομίλητοι σοφίας καὶ ἐπιστήμης, οἱ δὲ πυκνότεροι τὴν φύσιν καὶ πολυπράγματοι ἀπιστοῦσι τὸ παράπαν μηδὲ γενέσθαι τι τούτων.	While some - those who are more gullible - believe everything that is said because they are untrained in philosophy and science, others – those more cynical and worldly by nature – disbelieve entirely that any of these things actually happened.
Μάγων μὲν δὴ καὶ τότε ἐβράδυνεν, Ἀννίβᾳ τε συνελθεῖν οὐ δυνάμενος πολὺ διεστῶτι, καὶ τὸ μέλλον ἀεὶ περιορώμενος.	But Mago delayed because he could not join Hannibal at such a distance and because he was always of a hesitating disposition.
τί τῆς ἱερείας γίγνεται;	what belongs to the priestess?
ἐκ δὴ λογισμοῦ τε τοιούτου καὶ φύσεως θείας παραμενούσης πάντ’ αὐτοῖς ηὐξήθη ἃ πρὶν διήλθομεν.	As a result, then, of such reasoning and of the continuance of their divine nature all their wealth had grown to such a greatness as we previously described.
καὶ δίκη μὲν ἥδε παρανομίας ἐς πρέσβεις ἐγένετο Σένοσιν.	Such punishment was meted out to the Senones for their crime against the ambassadors.
ταπείνωσον σφόδρα τὴν ψυχήν σου. ὅτι ἐκδίκησις ἀσεβοῦς πῦρ καὶ σκώληξ.	because the retribution of the ungodly is fire and worm.
τόνδε γὰρ σῴζων ἐγὼ δεσμοὺς ἀεικεῖς καὶ δύας ἐκφυγγάνω.	for it is by safeguarding it that i am to escape my dishonorable bonds and outrage.
τινὲς δὲ ἐκ τοῦ λεγομένου ὑπέλαβον αὐτὸν τρεῖς ἔχειν κεφαλάς.	Because of this response, some thought him to have three heads.
αὐτὸς δὲ οὔ φησιν, ἀλλ’ ἑαυτοῦ, ἐν τῇ πρὸς Εὐρύλοχον ἐπιστολῇ.	but in his letter to Eurylochus, Epicurus himself denies it and says that he was self-taught.
Καὶ ἰδού, φωνὴ ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν, λέγουσα, Οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός, ἐν ᾧ εὐδόκησα.	And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῇ, Ἄφες πρῶτον χορτασθῆναι τὰ τέκνα· οὐ γὰρ καλόν ἐστιν λαβεῖν τὸν ἄρτον τῶν τέκνων καὶ βαλεῖν τοῖς κυναρίοις.	But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."
οὐ γὰρ οἱ ἐν ᾅδου αἰνέσουσίν σε, οὐδὲ οἱ ἀποθανόντες εὐλογήσουσίν σε, οὐδὲ ἐλπιοῦσιν οἱ ἐν ᾅδου τὴν ἐλεημοσύνην σου.	For those in Hades will not praise you, and those who die do not praise you, and those in Hades do not expect your mercy.
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Κύριος εἰς τὸν λαὸν τοὺς ὄφεις τοὺς θανατοῦντας, καὶ ἔδακνον τὸν λαόν· καὶ ἀπέθανεν λαὸς πολὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.	And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and many people died from among the children of Israel.
ὧδε μὲν εἴκαζον οἱ συνετώτεροι· τὸ δὲ πλέον, ὁρῶντες, οἷα καθ’ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ὁ Καίσαρ ὑβριζόμενός τε καὶ ζημιούμενος πάσχοι, οὐκ ἄπιστον ἐτίθεντο τὴν διαβολὴν οὐδὲ ὅσιον ἢ ἀνεκτὸν ἐνόμιζον Ἀντώνιον ὑπατεύοντα ἐς τὸ σῶμα ἐπιβεβουλεῦσθαι.	The more intelligent knew this, but the greater part, seeing what Octavius suffered daily from the indignities and the losses inflicted on him, considered the accusation not incredible, yet held it to be impious and intolerable that a conspiracy should be formed against Antony's life while he was consul.
τοῦτό ἐστιν ἔργον μὲν Μενδαίου Παιωνίου, πεποίηται δὲ ἀπὸ ἀνδρῶν πολεμίων, ὅτε Ἀκαρνᾶσι καὶ Οἰνιάδαις ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν ἐπολέμησαν.	It is the work of Paeonius of Mende, and was made from the proceeds of enemy spoils, I think from the war with the Arcarnanians and Oeniadae.
ὡς μὲν τοίνυν ἔτυπτέ με Λοχίτης, ἄρχων χειρῶν ἀδίκων, ἅπαντες ὑμῖν οἱ παρόντες μεμαρτυρήκασιν.	Well then, that Lochites struck me and was the aggressor all who were present when the event occurred have testified to you. But this offense should not be regarded as similar to other breaches of the law, nor should the penalty imposed for injury to the person be no greater than that which is inflicted for cheating a man of money
τὰ γὰρ πλεῖστα δι’ ἐκείνου τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν διεπράττετο, πρᾴως μὲν τοῖς συμμάχοις, κεχαρισμένως δὲ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ὁμιλοῦντος.	He was the foremost Hellenic statesman, dealing gently with the allies and acceptably with the Lacedaemonians.
ἄγε δή, λέξωμεν ἐπ᾽ Ἀργείοις εὐχὰς ἀγαθάς, ἀγαθῶν ποινάς.	come, let us invoke blessings upon the argives in return for blessings.
Καὶ ἰδού, γυνὴ αἱμορροοῦσα δώδεκα ἔτη, προσελθοῦσα ὄπισθεν, ἥψατο τοῦ κρασπέδου τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ.	And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment.
Θάμυριν μὲν αὐτόν τε ἤδη τυφλὸν καὶ λύρας κατεαγυίας ἐφαπτόμενον, Ἀρίων δὲ ὁ Μηθυμναῖός ἐστιν ἐπὶ δελφῖνος.	There is Thamyris himself, when already blind, with a broken lyre in his hand, and Arion of Methymna upon a dolphin.
παντᾷ τοι φλεγέθει κἀν σκότῳ μελαίνᾳ ξὺν τύχᾳ μερόπεσσι λαοῖς.	it shines everywhere, even in gloom, together with fortune obscure to mortal men.
ἐὰν δὲ πένηται ὁ ἀδελφός σου ὁ μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἀποδώσεται ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλθῃ ὁ ἀγχιστεύων ἐγγίζων ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ καὶ λυτρώσεται τὴν πρᾶσιν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ.	And if your kinsman who is close to you becomes poor, and he will yield some of his possession, then ⌊his closest kinsman redeemer⌋ will come and buy back his brother’s sold property.
πάνυ γὰρ ἐδέοντο αὐτοῦ παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτῶν.	for they earnestly besought him to come unto them and enter into their house.
καὶ περὶ μὲν τῶν παλαιῶν ὅρκων τοσαῦτα εἶπον, περὶ δὲ τῆς Ἀργείων ξυμμαχίας μετὰ τῶν φίλων βουλευσάμενοι ποιήσειν ὅτι ἂν δίκαιον ᾖ.	This was what she said on the subject of her former oaths. As to the Argive alliance she would confer with her friends, and do whatever was right.
πῶς γάρ; οὐκ ἄρα τῷ γε μεταβαίνειν κινοῖτ’ ἄν. οὐ γάρ. οὐδὲ μὴν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἂν στρέφοιτο·	Of course not. Then its motion cannot be change of place.
κᾆτ᾽ ἀνελκύσας ἐρωτᾷ σκανδάληθρ᾽ ἱστὰς ἐπῶν ἄνδρα Τιθωνὸν σπαράττων καὶ ταράττων καὶ κυκῶν.	the onslaught troubles, upsets and ruins poor old tithonus, who, crushed with age, stands tongue - tied;
καὶ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ἐρεῖς Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δέδωκα πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς ζωῆς καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ θανάτου·	And you will say to this people, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Look, I myself have placed before ⌊you⌋ the way of life and the way of death.
Πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε, ἀδελφοί μου, ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις,	My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
Καὶ ἐνδύουσιν αὐτὸν πορφύραν, καὶ περιτιθέασιν αὐτῷ πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον,	And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head,
ὧν ἡμεῖς οὐδεμίαν ποιούμεθα πρόνοιαν, ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τῶν Κυκλάδων νήσων ἀμφισβητοῦμεν, τοσαύτας δὲ τὸ πλῆθος πόλεις καὶ τηλικαύτας τὸ μέγεθος δυνάμεις οὕτως εἰκῇ τῷ βαρβάρῳ παραδεδώκαμεν. τοιγαροῦν τὰ μὲν ἔχει, τὰ δὲ μέλλει, τοῖς δ’ ἐπιβουλεύει, δικαίως ἁπάντων ἡμῶν καταπεφρονηκώς.	But these things we take no thought to prevent; instead, we wrangle about the islands of the Cyclades, when we have so recklessly given over so many cities and such great forces to the barbarians. And therefore some of our possessions are now his, some will soon be his, and others are threatened by his treacherous designs. And he has rightly conceived an utter contempt for us all;
Καὶ προσελθὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἥψατο αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν, Ἐγέρθητε καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε.	But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
καὶ εἶπαν Εἰ ἐξαποστέλλετε ὑμεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης θεοῦ Κυρίου Ἰσραήλ, μὴ δὴ ἐξαποστείλητε αὐτὴν κενήν, ἀλλὰ ἀποδιδόντες ἀπόδοτε αὐτῇ τῆς βασάνου, καὶ τότε ἰαθήσεσθε, καὶ ἐξιλασθήσεται ὑμῖν· μὴ οὐκ ἀποστῇ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν;	And they said, “If you send away the ark of the covenant of the Lord God of Israel, you definitely must not send it away empty. Instead, when you return it, return with it the plague, and then you will be healed, and it will atone for you. Otherwise, his hand will not withdraw from you.”
Παρόν μοι μὴ θανεῖν ὑπὲρ σέθεν, ἀλλʼ ἄνδρα σχεῖν Θεσσάλων ὃν ἤθελον	Though it was in my power not to die for you, but to get as husband whom I would of the Thessalians.
οὐκοῦν τοιάνδε τινὰ φαίνεται ἔχουσα τὴν δύναμιν, οἵαν, ᾧ ἂν ἐγγένηται, εἴτε πόλει τινὶ εἴτε γένει εἴτε στρατοπέδῳ εἴτε ἄλλῳ ὁτῳοῦν, πρῶτον μὲν ἀδύνατον αὐτὸ ποιεῖν πράττειν μεθ’ αὑτοῦ διὰ τὸ στασιάζειν καὶ διαφέρεσθαι, ἔτι δ’ ἐχθρὸν εἶναι ἑαυτῷ τε καὶ τῷ ἐναντίῳ παντὶ καὶ τῷ δικαίῳ;	And is it not apparent that its force is such that wherever it is found in city, family, camp, or in anything else it first renders the thing incapable of cooperation with itself owing to faction and difference, and secondly an enemy to itself and to its opposite in every case, the just?
ἑστάναι, εἶπον, καὶ κινεῖσθαι τὸ αὐτὸ ἅμα κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ ἆρα δυνατόν;	Is it possible for the same thing at the same time in the same respect to be at rest and in motion?
καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄνδρες Δαυεὶδ πρὸς αὐτόν Ἰδοὺ ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἣν εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς σέ, παραδοῦναι τὸν ἐχθρόν σου εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου· καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ ὡς ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου· καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυεὶδ καὶ ἀφεῖλεν τὸ πτερύγιον τῆς διπλοίδος τῆς Σαοὺλ λαθραίως.	And the men of David said to him, “Look, this is the day about which the Lord has spoken to you, to deliver your enemy into your hand; and you will do to him as it is good in your eyes.” So David rose and cut a flap from Saul’s cloak secretly.
οὗτος μὲν ἐμβριθέστατος ἐγένετο, ὥστε δόξης μὲν καταφρονεῖν, πρὸς δ’ ἀλήθειαν παρορμᾶν.	Monimus indeed showed himself a very grave moralist, so that he ever despised mere opinion and sought only truth.
ὅτε καὶ τὸ μνημονευόμενον εἶπεν, ὡς πρώην μὲν ἦν εὐμαρέστερον αὐτοῖς τὸ κωλῦσαι τὴν τυραννίδα συνισταμένην, νῦν δὲ μεῖζόν ἐστι καὶ λαμπρότερον ἐκκόψαι καὶ ἀνελεῖν συνεστῶσαν ἤδη καὶ πεφυκυῖαν.	Then it was, too, that he uttered the famous saying, that earlier it had been easier for them to hinder the tyranny, while it was in preparation but now it was a greater and more glorious task to uproot and destroy it when it had been already planted and was grown.
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ ἦν δόξα Κυρίου θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὴν ὅρασιν ἣν ἴδον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ.	And look; the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, just like the vision I saw in the plain.
εἰ δὲ ἀμφισβητεῖς καὶ φῂς Φρύνιχον ἀποκτεῖναι, δῆλον ὅτι μείζω τὸν δῆμον τὸν Ἀθηναίων κακὰ ποιήσας τὴν ὑπὲρ Φρυνίχου αἰτίαν πρὸς τοὺς τριάκοντα ἀπελύσω·	while if you, sir, dispute this, and declare that you did kill Phrynichus, it is evident that you must have done yet greater injuries to the Athenian people so as to redeem, in the eyes of the Thirty, the blame for Phrynichus’s death.
ἀπέστη δὲ οὐδεὶς τῶν κατ’ αὐτόν, ἐγγὺς ὄντων τῶν πολεμίων, ἀλλὰ κοσμήσαντες τὸ σῶμα καὶ πυρὰν κατασκευάσαντες ἐξεκόμιζον ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις οἱ φθάσαντες ὑποδῦναι καὶ βαστάσαι τὸ λέχος ἐπιγαυρούμενοι.	Not one of his followers went away, although the enemy were near, but after attiring the body and preparing a funeral pyre for it, they escorted it thither with military honours, and full of exultation were those who won the privilege of carrying the bier.
ἐγκρατεύεται δ’ ὅταν πράττῃ παρὰ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν κατὰ τὸν λογισμόν.	And a man exercises self-control when he acts against his desire in conformity with rational calculation.
πᾶν ἑρπετὸν ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν οἷς ἐστὶν τέσσαρες πόδες, βδελύγματά ἐστιν ὑμῖν.	Every creeping thing from among winged creatures that is four footed, it is an abomination to you.
ἂν δ᾽ ἄρα καὶ τούτους πείσωσι μὴ μαρτυρεῖν, ὡς οὐκ οἴομαι· εἰ δὲ μή, ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ἅπαντάς γε·	but even if they do persuade these men also not to testify - i do not expect they will, at any rate not all of them - one thing at least they will never succeed in accomplishing:
ἐπίπαστα λείξας δημιόπραθ᾽ ὁ βάσκανος ῥέγκει μεθύων ἐν ταῖσι βύρσαις ὕπτιος.	he is drunk and lies at full - length snoring on his hides.
Διαιρεῖται τοίνυν εἰς τρία, τό τε κανονικὸν καὶ φυσικὸν καὶ ἠθικόν.	It is divided into three parts—Canonic, Physics, Ethics.
κατὰ δὲ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον καὶ τὰς δόξας τὰς περὶ αὐτῶν, εἰ ἔστι μεθεκτὰ τὰ εἴδη, τῶν οὐσιῶν ἀναγκαῖον ἰδέας εἶναι μόνον.	but according to logical necessity, and from the views generally held about them, it follows that if the forms are participated in, then there can only be ideas of substances.
Καφισίδος ἐν τεμένει, πιστοὶ χορευτᾶν μάρτυρες. εἰ δέ τις ὄλβος ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν, ἄνευ καμάτου οὐ φαίνεται· ἐκ δὲ τελευτάσει νιν ἤτοι σάμερον δαίμων τὸ δὲ μόρσιμον οὐ παρφυκτόν, ἀλλ’ ἔσται χρόνος οὗτος, ὃ καί τιν’ ἀελπτίᾳ βαλὼν ἔμπαλιν γνώμας τὸ μὲν δώσει, τὸ δ’ οὔπω.	If there is any prosperity among men, it does not appear without hardship. A god will indeed grant it in full today . . . What is fated cannot be escaped. But that time will come, striking unexpectedly, and give one thing beyond all expectation, and withhold another.
ὑμεῖς δ᾽ ἐς ἀλλόφυλον ἐλθοῦσαι χθόνα γῆς τῆσδ᾽ ἐρασθήσεσθε·	but as for you, if you go to a foreign land, you will come to love this land - i forewarn you.
Ὁ ἀσπασμὸς τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ Παύλου. Μνημονεύετέ μου τῶν δεσμῶν. Ἡ χάρις μεθ' ὑμῶν. Ἀμήν.	This salutation by my own hand -- Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
Παραδώσει δὲ ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ πατὴρ τέκνον· καὶ ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς, καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς.	"Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.
οὐ βεβηλώσεις τὴν θυγατέρα σου ἐκπορνεῦσαι αὐτήν· καὶ οὐκ ἐκπορνεύσει ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἡ γῆ πλησθήσεται ἀνομίας.	You will not profane your daughter by making her commit harlotry, and the land will not commit harlotry, lest the land become filled with shameful behavior.
γενναῖος δὲ ὢν οὗτος τοὺς προσσχόντας ξένους ἠνάγκαζε πυκτεύειν καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον ἀνῄρει.	Being a doughty man he compelled the strangers that landed to box and in that way made an end of them.
ἡμῖν δὲ τοῖς φίλοις ζῶντι ἢ ἀποθανόντι εὐσεβέστερον ἀμύνειν αὐτῷ.	as to us, his friends, we are discharging our sacred duty to him more fitly by aiding him while he is alive than by aiding him after he is dead.
ἐγὼ μελιγλώσσων ἐπέων ἱεὶς ἀοιδὰν Μουσάων θεράπων ὀτρηρός, κατὰ τὸν Ὅμηρον.	i am he whose language is sweeter than honey, the zealous slave of the muses, as homer has it.
φάναι γάρ, τοῦ μὲν Θεοφράστου καθ’ ὑπερβολὴν ὀξύτητος πᾶν τὸ νοηθὲν ἐξερμηνεύοντος, τοῦ δὲ νωθροῦ τὴν φύσιν ὑπάρχοντος, ὡς τῷ μὲν χαλινοῦ δέοι, τῷ δὲ κέντρου.	for Theophrastus interpreted all his meaning with an excess of cleverness, whereas the other was naturally backward.
οὐδ᾽ ἂν διαλεχθείην γ᾽ ἀτεχνῶς τοῖς ἄλλοις οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἀπαντῶν·	absolutely i would not even converse with the others, not even if i met them;
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον αὐτοῦ τῆς φιλοτιμίας ἐπιλαμβανόμενοι καὶ τῆς φιλοδοξίας οἱ διαφθείροντες ἐνέβαλλον οὐ καθ’ ὥραν εἰς μεγαλοπραγμοσύνην, ἀναπείθοντες ὡς, ὅταν πρῶτον ἄρξηται τὰ δημόσια πράττειν, οὐ μόνον ἀμαυρώσοντα τοὺς ἄλλους στρατηγοὺς καὶ δημαγωγοὺς εὐθύς, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν Περικλέους δύναμιν ἐν τοῖς Ἕλλησι καὶ δόξαν ὑπερβαλούμενον.	However, it was rather his love of distinction and love of fame to which his corrupters appealed, and thereby plunged him all too soon into ways of pre-sumptuous scheming, persuading him that he had only to enter public life, and he would straightway cast into total eclipse the ordinary generals and public leaders, and not only that, he would even surpass Pericles in power and reputation among the Hellenes.
ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ βούληται ἐν ταῖς πέντε ἡμέραις βοηθῆσαι ἡμῖν, αὐτὸς ἔχει τὴν ἐξουσίαν ἐν αἷς θέλει σκεπάσαι ἡμέραις, ἢ καὶ ὀλεθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν.	For if he should not desire in the course of the next five days to help us, he has the power to protect us on the day he desires, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies.
ὧν εἰ θάτερον ἔμελλεν ἔσεσθαι, καλῶς, ὅτι μὴ παρῆς.	If the latter would have befallen you, then it is well that you were not present.
οὐ γὰρ δι’ ἄλλο τί γ’ ἦν αὐτῇ τὸ τεχνικῇ τ’ εἶναι καὶ τοῦ ζῴου διασωστικῇ καὶ τῶν νοσημάτων κριτικῇ παρὰ τὸ προσίεσθαι μὲν καὶ φυλάττειν τὸ οἰκεῖον, ἀποκρίνειν δὲ τὸ ἀλλότριον.	But in this matter, too, Asclepiades realized the logical sequence of the principles he had assumed he showed no scruples, however, in opposing plain fact
Ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ ὤφθη ὁ θεὸς τῷ Σαλωμὼν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Αἴτησαι τί σοι δῶ.	In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I might give to you.”
πάντ’ ἔχεις, εἴ σε τούτων μοῖρ’ ἐφίκοιτο καλῶν.	you have everything, if a share of these fine things comes to you.
ἀλλ᾽ ὦ τηθῶν ἀνδρειοτάτων καὶ μητριδίων ἀκαληφῶν, χωρεῖτ᾽ ὀργῇ καὶ μὴ τέγγεσθ᾽·	o sprung from the seed of most valiant - wombed grand - mothers, scions of savage and dangerous nettles!
καὶ τοὺς ἐν Πραινεστῷ προσέταξε χωρὶς ὅπλων προελθεῖν ἅπαντας ἐς τὸ πεδίον καὶ προελθόντων τοὺς μὲν ἑαυτῷ τι χρησίμους γενομένους, ὀλίγους πάμπαν, ἐξείλετο, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ἐκέλευσεν ἐς τρία ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων διαστῆναι, Ῥωμαίους τε καὶ Σαυνίτας καὶ Πραινεστίους·	The remainder he ordered to be divided into three parts, consisting of Romans, Samnites, and Prænestians respectively.
φοβηθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ξὲρξης φρουρεῖσθαι αὐτὸν προσέταξε καθάπερ ἱστορεῖ Ἀγαθαρχίδης Σάμιος δευτέρᾳ τῶν Περσικῶν.	This gave Xerxes an apprehension of him, so that he caused him to be still kept in custody,—This I find in Agatharchides the Samian, in the Second Book of his Persian History.
ἄχρι ἧς ἡμέρας, ἐντειλάμενος τοῖς ἀποστόλοις διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου οὓς ἐξελέξατο, ἀνελήφθη·	until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,
καὶ τῇ Κλέωνος εὐχερείᾳ καὶ βωμολοχίᾳ πρὸς ἡδονὴν μεταχειριζομένῃ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους διὰ τῶν ὁμοίων ἀντιπαρεξάγειν ἀπίθανος ὤν, χορηγίαις ἀνελάμβανε καὶ γυμνασιαρχίαις ἑτέραις τε τοιαύταις φιλοτιμίαις τὸν δῆμον, ὑπερβαλλόμενος πολυτελείᾳ καὶ χάριτι τοὺς πρὸ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἅπαντας.	And since he despaired of his ability to vie successfully with the versatile buffoonery by which Cleon catered to the pleasure of the Athenians, he tried to captivate the people by choral and gymnastic exhibitions, and other like prodigalities, outdoing in the costliness and elegance of these all his predecessors and contemporaries.
ἐὰν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ποιῇς καὶ μὴ ἐγκρατεύσῃ ἀπ̓ αὐτοῦ, ζήσῃ τῷ θεῷ, καὶ πάντες ζήσονται τῷ θεῷ οἱ οὕτω ποιοῦντες.	If you do good, and do not refrain from it, you shall live to God, and all who act so shall live to God.
Οὐσίαν δὲ θεοῦ Ζήνων μέν φησι τὸν ὅλον κόσμον καὶ τὸν οὐρανόν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ Χρύσιππος ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ Περὶ θεῶν καὶ Ποσειδώνιος ἐν πρώτῳ Περὶ θεῶν.	The substance of God is declared by Zeno to be the whole world and the heaven, as well as by Chrysippus in his first book Of the Gods, and by Posidonius in his first book with the same title.
τετάρτῳ δὲ μηνὶ συνθήκας γενέσθαι διὰ τῆς Ἱππολύτης·	And after three months, he says, a treaty of peace was made through the agency of Hippolyta
ἴσως με οἴεσθε, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, ἀπορίᾳ λόγων ἑαλωκέναι τοιούτων οἷς ἂν ὑμᾶς ἔπεισα, εἰ ᾤμην δεῖν ἅπαντα ποιεῖν καὶ λέγειν ὥστε ἀποφυγεῖν τὴν δίκην.	Perhaps you think, gentlemen, that I have been convicted through lack of such words as would have moved you to acquit me, if I had thought it right to do and say everything to gain an acquittal.
καὶ οὐ προσέθετο Σαμουὴλ ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸν Σαοὺλ ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐπένθει Σαμουὴλ ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ Κύριος μετεμελήθη ὅτι ἐβασίλευσεν τὸν Σαοὺλ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.	And Samuel made no attempt still to see Saul until the day of his death because Samuel mourned over Saul, and the Lord regretted that he crowned Saul over Israel.
τῇ δὲ Μουνυχίᾳ χαράκωμα καὶ τάφρον περιβαλὼν διὰ μέσου, Μεγάροις ἐπέπλευσεν ὑπὸ Κασάνδρου φρουρουμένοις.	As for himself, he declared that, although he desired to see the city, he would not do so before he had completed its liberation by ridding it of its garrison meanwhile, after running a trench and a palisade round Munychia, he sailed against Megara, where a garrison had been stationed by Cassander.
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, δοῦναι ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν Χανάαν ὥστε εἶναι ὑμῶν θεός.	I am the Lord, your God, who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt to give to you the land of Canaan, in order to be your God.
Τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, Ἀφέωνταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, Ἔγειραι, καὶ ἆρόν σου τὸν κράββατον, καὶ περιπάτει;	"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'?
μὴ ψεῦσον ὦ Ζεῦ τῆς ἐπιούσης ἐλπίδος. τίς τῶνδ᾽ ἐρυμνῶν δωμάτων ἔχει κράτος, ὅστις ξένους δέξαιτο ποντίῳ σάλῳ κάμνοντας ἐν χειμῶνι καὶ ναυαγίαις;	oh, zeus! grant it may not prove a lying one!" euripides enters as menelaus " to what master does this splendid palace belong? will he welcome strangers who have been tried on the billows of the sea by storm and shipwreck?"
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν οὐδὲν ἔτι διὰ τῶν οὐρητήρων ἐπανέλθοι πρὸς τοὺς νεφρούς.	Here, then, it becomes obvious that not only in a dead animal, but in one which is still living, the ureters are prevented from receiving back the urine from the bladder.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ πάσης τῆς γῆς ἔρημον ποιήσω σε·	This is what the Lord says, “⌊When all the land rejoices⌋, I will make you deserted.
ὅτι δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν ἡρώων τὰ ὅπλα ὁμοίως χαλκᾶ ἦν πάντα, μαρτυρεῖ μοι καὶ Ὁμήρου τῶν ἐπῶν τὰ ἔς τε ἀξίνην ἔχοντα τὴν Πεισάνδρου καὶ ἐς τοῦ Μηριόνου τὸν ὀιστόν.	I have evidence that in the heroic age weapons were universally of bronze in the verses of Homer about the axe of Peisander and the arrow of Meriones.
καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις μὲν πρὸς ταῖς αὐτοῦ ὑπαρχούσαις ἐξ Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας τοῖς τἀκείνων ἑλομένοις ναῦς ἐπετάχθη ποιεῖσθαι κατὰ μέγεθος τῶν πόλεων, ὡς ἐς τὸν πάντα ἀριθμὸν πεντακοσίων νεῶν ἐσομένων, καὶ ἀργύριον ῥητὸν ἑτοιμάζειν, τά τε ἄλλα ἡσυχάζοντας καὶ Ἀθηναίους δεχομένους μιᾷ νηὶ ἕως ἂν ταῦτα παρασκευασθῇ.	Lacedaemon, in addition to the existing marine, gave orders to the states that had declared for her in Italy and Sicily to build vessels up to a grand total of five hundred, the quota of each city being determined by its size, and also to provide a specified sum of money. Till these were ready they were to remain neutral and to admit single Athenian ships into their harbors.
ὥσπερ γὰρ βασιλεῦσι καὶ δυνάσταις καὶ τετράρχαις ἔθνεσί τε καὶ πόλεσι πάσαις ταῖς μεταξὺ Συρίας καὶ Μαιώτιδος καὶ Ἀρμενίας καὶ Ἰλλυριῶν προείρητο πέμπειν καὶ κομίζειν τὰς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον παρασκευάς, οὕτω πᾶσι τοῖς περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνίταις ἐπάναγκες ἦν εἰς Σάμον ἀπαντᾶν·	For just as all the kings, dynasts, tetrarchs, nations, and cities between Syria, the Maeotic Lake, Armenia, and Illyria had been ordered to send or bring their equipment for the war, so all the dramatic artists were compelled to put in an appearance at Samos
αὐτάρκη δὲ τὴν ἀρετὴν πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν, μηδενὸς προσδεομένην ὅτι μὴ Σωκρατικῆς ἰσχύος.	And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a Socrates.
κἀγὼ πάλου τ᾽ ἔκυρσα τοῦπερ ἤθελον, κἀπεστράτευσα πολλὰ σὺν πολλῷ στρατῷ·	and I in turn attained the lot I desired, and many a campaign I made with a valiant force;
ἀλλὰ τοῦτό ἐστιν ὃ ἐμοὶ πάλαι ὄκνον ἐντίθησι λέγειν, ὁρῶντι ὡς πολὺ παρὰ δόξαν ῥηθήσεται·	Nor, until this happens, will this constitution which we have been expounding in theory ever be put into practice within the limits of possibility and see the light of the sun. But this is the thing that has made me so long shrink from speaking out, because I saw that it would be a very paradoxical saying.
καὶ Σαμουὴλ εἶδεν τὸν Σαούλ, καὶ Κύριος ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃν εἶπά σοι Οὗτος ἄρξει ἐν τῷ λαῷ μου.	Samuel saw Saul, and the Lord spoke to him, “Here is the man whom I spoke to you. This man will rule among my people.”
ἐνταῦθα Ἡρακλεῖόν ἐστιν, ἄγαλμα δὲ τὸ μὲν λίθου λευκοῦ Πρόμαχος καλούμενον, ἔργον δὲ Ξενοκρίτου καὶ Εὐβίου Θηβαίων·	Here is a sanctuary of Heracles. The image, of white marble, is called Champion, and the Thebans Xenocritus and Eubius were the artists.
τὴν δ’ ἁγνείαν εἶναι διὰ καθαρμῶν καὶ λουτρῶν καὶ περιρραντηρίων καὶ διὰ τοῦ καθαρεύειν ἀπό τε κήδους καὶ λεχοῦς καὶ μιάσματος παντὸς καὶ ἀπέχεσθαι βρωτῶν θνησειδίων τε κρεῶν καὶ τριγλῶν καὶ μελανούρων καὶ ᾠῶν καὶ τῶν ᾠοτόκων ζῴων καὶ κυάμων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὧν παρακελεύονται καὶ οἱ τὰς τελετὰς ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἐπιτελοῦντες.	Purification is by cleansing, baptism and lustration, and by keeping clean from all deaths and births and all pollution, and abstaining from meat and flesh of animals that have died, mullets, gurnards, eggs and egg-sprung animals, beans, and the other abstinences prescribed by those who perform mystic rites in the temples.
ὅτε μέντοι στρεβλοῦται, ἔνθα καὶ μύζει καὶ οἰμώζει.	When on the rack, however, he will give vent to cries and groans.
τοιγαροῦν τοιαύταις χρώμενοι γνώμαις, ἐνενήκοντα μὲν ἔτη τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἡγεμόνες κατέστησαν, Φοινίκην δὲ καὶ Κιλικίαν ἐπόρθησαν, ἐπ’ Εὐρυμέδοντι δὲ καὶ πεζομαχοῦντες καὶ ναυμαχοῦντες ἐνίκησαν, ἑκατὸν δὲ τριήρεις τῶν βαρβάρων αἰχμαλώτους ἔλαβον, ἅπασαν δὲ τὴν Ἀσίαν κακῶς ποιοῦντες περιέπλευσαν.	It was because they held such beliefs as these that for ninety years they were leaders of the Greeks. They ravaged Phoenicia and Cilicia, triumphed by land and sea at the Eurymedon, captured a hundred barbarian triremes and sailed round the whole of Asia wasting it.
διαπειραθέντα δ’ αὐτὸν τὰ ψευδῆ λέγειν, ὕστερον δὲ τἀληθῆ λέγοντα, οὐδέτερα ὠφέλησεν,	However, neither his persevering attempts at falsehood nor his subsequent confession of the truth helped him.
τῆς δ’ ὅτε δὴ Περσεὺς κεφαλὴν ἀπεδειροτόμησεν, ἔκθορε Χρυσαωρ τε μέγας καὶ Πήγασος ἵππος.	And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springsof Ocean
Ἀδιαλείπτως οὖν προσκαρτερῶμεν τῇ ἐλπίδι ἡμῶν καὶ τῷ ἀρραβῶνι τῆς δικαιοσύνης ἡμῶν, ὅς ἐστι Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς, ὃς ἀνήνεγκεν ἡμῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῷ ἰδίῳ σώματι ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον, ὃς ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ ἐποίησεν, οὐδὲ εὑρέθη δόλος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ: ἀλλὰ δἰ ἡμᾶς, ἵνα ζήσωμεν ἐν αὐτῷ, πάντα ὑπέμεινεν.	Let us then persevere unceasingly in our hope. and in the pledge of our righteousness, that is in Christ Jesus, who bare our sins in his own body on the tree, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth, but for our sakes, that we might live in him, he endured all things.
διὸ καὶ ἡ τοῦ κύκλου μάλιστα μία τῶν γραμμῶν, ὅτι ὅλη καὶ τέλειός ἐστιν.	hence the circumference of a circle is of all lines the most truly one, because it is whole and complete.
φασὶ δὲ καὶ βωμὸν εἰρήνης διὰ ταῦτα τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἱδρύσασθαι, καὶ Καλλίαν τὸν πρεσβεύσαντα τιμῆσι διαφερόντως.	And they say that the Athenians also built the altar of Peace to commemorate this event, and paid distinguished honors to Callias as their ambassador.
πραῢν δ’ Ἰάσων μαλθακᾷ φωνᾷ ποτιστάζων ὄαρον βάλλετο κρηπῖδα σοφῶν ἐπέων·	And Jason, with his soothing voice distilling gentle language, laid the foundation of skillful words
οἱ δὲ πρεσβύτατοι καὶ δημοτικώτατοι τοὐναντίον ἠξίουν οὐ χαλεπὸν οὐδὲ βαρύν, ἀλλὰ πρᾷον καὶ φιλάνθρωπον ὑπὸ τῆς ἐξουσίας ἔσεσθαι τόν δῆμον·	But the oldest senators, and those most inclined to favour the people, maintained on the contrary that it would not be rendered harsh or severe by its exercise of this power, but mild and humane
τοῖς τε φίλοις παραγγείλαντα τῶν δογμάτων μεμνῆσθαι, οὕτω τελευτῆσαι.	and then, having bidden his friends remember his doctrines, breathed his last.
γέγραφα δ’ αὐτῷ μαρτυρίαν κοσμιωτέραν μὲν ἢ κατ’ ἐκεῖνον, μικρῷ δὲ σαφεστέραν ἢ τῷ Μισγόλᾳ.	I have written out for him an affidavit that is too respectable for a man of his character, but a little more explicit than the one I wrote for Misgolas.
καὶ τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ μετάνοιά τις εὐθὺς ἦν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀναλογισμὸς ὠμὸν τὸ βούλευμα καὶ μέγα ἐγνῶσθαι, πόλιν ὅλην διαφθεῖραι μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ τοὺς αἰτίους.	The morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on the horrid cruelty of a decree, which condemned a whole city to the fate merited only by the guilty.
ἐκείνη μὲν οὖν συνοικήσασα οὐ πολὺν χρόνον, τεκοῦσα αὐτῷ τὴν ἐμὴν μητέρα, μετὰ ἐνιαυτοὺς τέτταρας τὸν βίον ἐτελεύτησεν·	She did not live long with him she bore my mother, and died after four years.
εἴη δ’ ἂν καὶ ὁ τοῦ ἡμετέρου ἑταίρου Θεάγους χαλινὸς οἷος κατασχεῖν·	and the bridle of our companion Theages also might operate as a restraint.
καὶ τῶν ταξιάρχων τινὸς ἀπ’ αὐτομάτου τὸν βραχίονα μύρον ῥόδινον ἐξανθεῖν, καὶ πολλάκις ἐξαλείφοντας καὶ ἀπομάττοντας μηδὲν περαίνειν.	and that of its own accord the arm of one of the officers sweated oil of roses, and though they often rubbed and wiped it off it was of no avail.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ κομίσαντες αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν καλούμενον Θησαυρόν, οἴκημα κατάγειον οὔτε πνεῦμα λαμβάνον οὔτε φῶς ἔξωθεν οὔτε θύρας ἔχον, ἀλλὰ μεγάλῳ λίθῳ περιαγομένῳ κατακλειόμενον, ἐνταῦθα κατέθεντο, καὶ τὸν λίθον ἐπιρράξαντες ἄνδρας ἐνόπλους κύκλῳ περιέστησαν.	However, they carried Philopoemen into the Thesaurus, as it was called, a subterranean chamber which admitted neither air nor light from outside and had no door, but was closed by dragging a huge stone in front of it. Here they placed him, and after planting the stone against it, set a guard of armed men round about.
Φερεκύδης δέ φησι Τελαμῶνα φίλον, οὐκ ἀδελφὸν Πηλέως εἶναι, ἀλλ’ Ἀκταίου παῖδα καὶ Γλαύκης τῆς Κυχρέως.	But Pherecydes says that Telamon was a friend, not a brother of Peleus, he being a son of Actaeus and Glauce, daughter of Cychreus.
δηλοῦσι δὲ αἱ κατὰ τοὺς ὕπνους τροπαὶ τῶν ὀνείρων, ἃς τρέπεται τὸ φανταστικόν ἐξ ἀρχῆς βραχείας παντοδαπὰ καὶ πάθη καὶ εἴδωλα γινόμενον. κινεῖσθαι δ’ ἀεὶ πέφυκε·	This is clear from the transformations which occur in dreams, where slight initial material is transformed by the imagination into all sorts of emotions and shapes.
καὶ ταῦθ’ ὅτι ἀληθῆ λέγω, πάντες, ὅσοι κατ’ ἐκείνους τοὺς χρόνους ἐγίγνωσκον Μισγόλαν καὶ Τίμαρχον, ἴσασιν.	The truth of this story is known to everybody who knew Misgolas and Timarchus in those days.
οἴμοι Σώκρατες ὥσπερ με τὸν Ἀθάμανθ᾽ ὅπως μὴ θύσετε. οὔκ, ἀλλὰ ταῦτα πάντα τοὺς τελουμένους ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν.	ah me! socrates, see that you do not sacrifice me like athamas! no; we do all these to those who get initiated.
ἐπὶ ταύτην ἀφικόμενος τούς τε πειρωμένους ἀμύνεσθαι διέφθειρε καὶ λείαν περιβαλλόμενος ἀπήλαυνεν ἐς τὴν Μεσσήνην.	Arriving here he killed those who offered resistance and surrounding the cattle started to drive them off to Messene.
διαφυγεῖν δ’ ὀλίγους, ὧν ἦν καὶ Ἄρχιππος ὁ Ταραντῖνος καὶ Λῦσις ὁ προειρημένος.	but a very few escaped, including Archippus of Tarentum and Lysis, already mentioned.
ἔτι δὲ καὶ τοῦτο, ἀδελφοί μου· εἰ ὁ κύριος ὑπέμεινεν παθεῖν περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡμῶν, ὢν παντὸς τοῦ κόσμου κύριος ᾧ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου· Ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ’ εἰκόνα καὶ καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν ἡμετέραν· πῶς οὖν ὑπέμεινεν ὑπὸ χειρὸς ἀνθρώπων παθεῖν;	Moreover, my brethren, if the Lord endured to suffer for our life, though he is the Lord of all the world, to whom God said before the foundation of the world, Let us make man in our image and likeness, how, then, did he endure to suffer at the hand of man?
ᾧ τινι ὅρκῳ βοηθοῦντες οἱ τῶν ὀμωμοκότων ἔκγονοι καὶ τὰς ἀρὰς ἀπερύκοντες ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν οὐχ ὑπεμείναμεν ἐς πολὺ περιιδεῖν ἕνα ἄνδρα, εἰ καὶ φίλος ἦν ἡμῖν καὶ χρήσιμος, τά τε κοινὰ χρήματα καὶ στρατόπεδα καὶ χειροτονίας ἀρχῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ δήμου καὶ ἡγεμονίας ἐθνῶν ἀπὸ τῆς βουλῆς ἐς ἑαυτὸν περιφέροντα καὶ νόμον ἀντὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ κύριον ἀντὶ τοῦ δήμου καὶ αὐτοκράτορα ἀντὶ τῆς βουλῆς γιγνόμενον ἐς ἅπαντα.	We could no longer endure that one man, although he was our friend and benefactor, should take from the people and vest in himself the control of the public money, the armies, and the elections, and from the Senate the appointment of governors of the provinces that his will should take the place of the laws, his rule should supplant that of the people, and his supremacy that of the Senate in everything.
ἐπεὶ δὲ νὺξ γεγόνει καὶ μετὰ δεῖπνον ἐτράποντο πρὸς ὕπνον καὶ ἀνάπαυσιν, αἰφνίδιον ἡ σελήνη πλήρης οὖσα καὶ μετέωρος ἐμελαίνετο καὶ τοῦ φωτὸς ἀπολιπόντος αὐτὴν χρόας ἀμείψασα παντοδαπὰς ἠφανίσθη.	Now, when night had come, and the soldiers, after supper, were betaking themselves to rest and sleep, on a sudden the moon, which was full and high in the heavens, grew dark, lost its light, took on all sorts of colours in succession, and finally disappeared.

καὶ πάλιν ὑμῖν ἀντιδιέξειμι ἀνθρώπων πεπορνευμένων αἰσχρῶς καὶ φανερῶς ὀνόματα, ἵνα ὑμεῖς ἀναμνησθέντες κατανείμητε εἰς τὴν προσήκουσαν τάξιν Τίμαρχον.

ἐπεὶ δὲ ἡ συμπλοκή ἐστιν καὶ ἡ διαίρεσις ἐν διανοίᾳ ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἐν τοῖς πράγμασι, τὸ δ᾽ οὕτως ὂν ἕτερον ὂν τῶν κυρίως [ ἢ γὰρ τὸ τί ἐστιν ἢ ὅτι ποιὸν ἢ ὅτι ποσὸν ἤ τι ἄλλο συνάπτει ἢ ἀφαιρεῖ ἡ διάνοια ], τὸ μὲν ὡς συμβεβηκὸς καὶ τὸ ὡς ἀληθὲς ὂν ἀφετέον - τὸ γὰρ αἴτιον τοῦ μὲν ἀόριστον τοῦ δὲ τῆς διανοίας τι πάθος, καὶ ἀμφότερα περὶ τὸ λοιπὸν γένος τοῦ ὄντος, καὶ οὐκ ἔξω δηλοῦσιν οὖσάν τινα φύσιν τοῦ ὄντος - διὸ ταῦτα μὲν ἀφείσθω, σκεπτέον δὲ τοῦ ὄντος αὐτοῦ τὰ	but since the combination and separation exists in thought and not in things, and this sense of " being " is different from the proper senses ( since thought attaches or detaches essence or quality or quantity or some other category ), we may dismiss the accidental and real senses of " being." for the cause of the one is indeterminate and of the other an affection of thought; and both are connected with the remaining genus of " being," and do not indicate any objective reality. let us therefore dismiss them, and
ἧς ἔτι μαρτύριον τῆς πονηρίας καπνιζομένη καθέστηκε χέρσος, καὶ ἀτελέσιν ὥραις καρποφοροῦντα φυτά, ἀπιστούσης ψυχῆς μνημεῖον ἑστηκυῖα στήλη ἁλός.	of which still as evidence of the wickedness, appointed a smoking barren land, and plants bearing unripened fruit at their seasons, a pillar of salt set up as a monument to an unfaithful soul.
καὶ γιγνομένων ἐν Ῥώμῃ σημείων ἐκ Διὸς φοβερῶν, οἱ μὲν τὰ Σιβύλλεια ἐπισκεπτόμενοι δέκα ἄνδρες ἔφασαν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ τι ἐς Πεσινοῦντα τῆς Φρυγίας, ἔνθα σέβουσιν οἱ Φρύγες θεῶν μητέρα, πεσεῖσθαι τῶνδε τῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ δεῖν αὐτὸ ἐς τὴν Ῥώμην ἐνεχθῆναι.	As certain direful prodigies sent by Jupiter had appeared in Rome, the decemviri, having consulted the Sibylline books, said that something would soon fall from heaven at Pessinus in Phrygia (where the mother of the gods is worshipped by the Phrygians), which ought to be brought to Rome.

καὶ Μετέλλα μόλις διακλέψασα ἑαυτὴν καὶ τοὺς παῖδας, ἧκεν ἀγγέλλουσα τήν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς ἐπαύλεις ὑπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐμπεπρῆσθαι καὶ δεομένη τοῖς οἴκοι βοηθεῖν.	Metella, also, who had with difficulty stolen herself and her children away, came with tidings that his house and his villas had been burned by his enemies, and with entreaties that he would come to the help of his partisans at home.
τὸ γὰρ ἐμὸν θροῶ πάθος ἐπεγχύδαν.	for it is my own affliction, crowning the cup, that i bewail.
ὅταν οὖν ὁ τοῦ Κρόνου ἀστήρ, ὃν Φαίνοντα μὲν ἡμεῖς, ἐκείνους δὲ Νυκτοῦρον ἔφη καλεῖν, εἰς Ταῦρον παραγένηται δι’ ἐτῶν τριάκοντα, παρασκευασαμένους ἐν χρόνῳ πολλῷ τὰ περὶ τὴν θυσίαν καὶ τὸν ἀπόπλουν ἐκπέμπειν κλήρῳ λαχόντας ἐν πλοίοις τοσούτοις θεραπείαν τε πολλὴν καὶ παρασκευὴν ἀναγκαίαν μέλλουσι πλεῖν πέλαγος τοσοῦτον εἰρεσίᾳ καὶ χρόνον ἐπὶ ξένης βιοτεύειν πολὺν ἐμβαλλομένους·	And therefore in that place they give the first honor to Hercules, and the second to Saturn. Now when the star of Saturn, by us called Phaenon and by them Nycturus, comes to the sign of Taurus, as it does once in the time of thirty years, they, having been a long time preparing what is necessary for a solemn sacrifice and a long voyage or navigation, send forth those on whom the lots fall to row in that vast sea, and make their abode for a great while in foreign countries.

αὕτη μὲν ἡ μήρινθος οὐδὲν ἔσπασεν.	the fish has not bitten this time.

καὶ πάντα τὰ κέρατα τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν συνκλάσω, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται τὰ κέρατα τοῦ δικαίου.	And all the horns of the sinners I will shatter, and the horns of the righteous one will be raised up.
καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων Ὑμεῖς ἐνεδρεύσατε ὀπίσω τῆς πόλεως· μὴ μακρὰν γίνεσθε ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἔσεσθε πάντες ἕτοιμοι.	And he commanded them, saying, “You must lie in ambush behind the city. Do not be too far from the city, and you all must be ready.
καὶ εἶπα τῷ ἑνὶ τῷ περιβεβλημένῳ τὰ βύσσινα τῷ ἐπάνω Πότε οὖν συντέλεια ὧν εἴρηκάς μοι τῶν θαυμαστῶν καὶ ὁ καθαρισμὸς τούτων;	And I spoke to the one clothed with fine linen above the river, “When, therefore, will be the conclusion of the things you have spoken to me, of those astonishing things and their purification?”
ἡμέρα ὀργῆς, ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη, ἡμέρα θλίψεως καὶ ἀνάγκης, ἡμέρα ἀωρίας καὶ ἀφανισμοῦ, ἡμέρα σκότους καὶ γνόφου, ἡμέρα νεφέλης καὶ ὁμίχλης,	That day will be a day of wrath, a day of affliction and torture, a day of darkness and extermination, a day of gloom and darkness, a day of cloud and fog,
γέγραπται δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ τοίχῳ γράμμασιν Ἀττικοῖς ἔργα εἶναι Πραξιτέλους.	On the wall, in Attic characters, is written that they are works of Praxiteles.
καὶ τέλος λέοντι παραβληθείς, οὕτω κατέστρεψεν.	and finally he was thrown to a lion and so met his end.

Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape.
πότερον οὖν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, ἐν τῇ πόλει οἴει ἡμῖν χαλκέας πλείους ἐνέσεσθαι ἢ τοὺς ἀληθινοὺς φύλακας τούτους;	Which class, then, said I, do you suppose will be the more numerous in our city, the smiths or these true guardians?
Πρὸς Κλεάνθην, Ἐπιστολῶν δ′.	Panaetius and Sosicrates consider the Letters to be alone genuine

ἀκουτιεῖς με ἀγαλλίασιν καὶ εὐφροσύνην. ἀγαλλιάσονται ὀστᾶ τεταπεινωμένα.	Thou shalt make me hear joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled shall rejoice.
καὶ μέντοι καὶ λόγος ἐχώρει διὰ τοῦ σωφρονοῦντος ἔτι τῆς πόλεως μέρους, ὡς οὐ περιοπτέον, εἰς ταὐτὸ τῆς Κράσσου καὶ Πομπηΐου δυνάμεως συνελθούσης, παντάπασιν ὑπέρογκον καὶ βαρεῖαν τὴν ἀρχὴν γενομένην, ἀλλ’ ἀφαιρετέον αὐτῆς τὸν ἕτερον.	And indeed it was currently said among those citizens who still retained their good sense, that the consular power must not be suffered to become altogether overweening and oppressive by the union of the influence of Pompey and Crassus, but that one or the other of these men must be deprived of it.
ἄπεχε τῆς βοὸς τὸν ταῦρον·	keep the bull from the cow!
κοινῇ δὲ διαλαμβάνοντες ἅπαντες πειρασόμεθα τὸ πρέπον εἰς δύναμιν οἷς ἐπέταξας ἀποδοῦναι.	Thus, with united effort, each taking his part, we will endeavor to the best of our powers to do justice to the theme you have prescribed.
καὶ κατέβη ὁ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος ὁ ἐνκαθήμενος ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἐτρέψαντο αὐτοὺς καὶ κατέκοψαν αὐτοὺς ἕως Ἑρμάν· καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν.	And so Amalek and the Canaanites who were living in that mountainous area came down and put them to flight and cut them down as far as Hormah, and they turned away toward the encampment.

ὁ δὲ δὴ προστάτης ἐκεῖνος αὐτὸς δῆλον δὴ ὅτι μέγας μεγαλωστὶ οὐ κεῖται, ἀλλὰ καταβαλὼν ἄλλους πολλοὺς ἕστηκεν ἐν τῷ δίφρῳ τῆς πόλεως, τύραννος ἀντὶ προστάτου ἀποτετελεσμένος.	And then obviously that protector does not lie prostrate, mighty with far-flung limbs, in Homeric overthrow, but overthrowing many others towers in the car of state transformed from a protector into a perfect and finished tyrant.
καίτοι τήν γε αὐτὴν δίων εἶχεν βούλησιν ἥνπερ ἂν ἐγὼ φαίην δεῖν ἐμὲ καὶ ἄλλον, ὅστις μέτριος, περί τε τῆς αὑτοῦ δυνάμεως καὶ φίλων καὶ περὶ πόλεως τῆς αὑτοῦ διανοοῖτ’ ἂν εὐεργετῶν ἐν δυνάμει καὶ τιμαῖσιν γενέσθαι τὰ μέγιστα ἐν ταῖς μεγίσταις.

τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ τὰ παραρύματα καὶ τὰ διατόνια καὶ τοὺς μοχλοὺς καὶ τοὺς στύλους,	the tabernacle and its coverings and its curtain rings and its stabilizing bars and its posts,
καὶ οὕτως τὰ κρυπτὰ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ φανερὰ γίνεται· καὶ οὕτως πεσὼν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον προσκυνήσει τῷ θεῷ ἀπαγγέλλων ὅτι Ὁ θεὸς ὄντως ἐν ὑμῖν ἐστιν.	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.
καὶ ὁρῶν δήπου τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐν χρόνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρυσὸν ἀποδείξαντας τὴν ἔμπροσθεν πολιτείαν τά τε ἄλλα καὶ φίλον ἄνδρα ἐμοὶ πρεσβύτερον Σωκράτη, ὃν ἐγὼ σχεδὸν οὐκ ἂν αἰσχυνοίμην εἰπὼν δικαιότατον εἶναι τῶν τότε, ἐπί τινα τῶν πολιτῶν μεθ’ ἑτέρων ἔπεμπον, βίᾳ ἄξοντα ὡς ἀποθανούμενον, ἵνα δὴ μετέχοι τῶν πραγμάτων αὐτοῖς, εἴτε βούλοιτο εἴτε μή·	and above all how they treated my aged friend Socrates, whom I would hardly scruple to call the most just of men then living, when they tried to send him, along with others, after one of the citizens, to fetch him by force that he might be put to death—their object being that Socrates, whether he wished or no, might be made to share in their political actions
ὧν ἄνευ γὰρ οὐχ οἷόν τε εὐδαιμονεῖν, ἔνιοι μέρη τῆς εὐδαιμονίας εἶναι νομίζουσι.	for some people regard the things that are indispensable conditions of being happy as actual parts of happiness.Now to examine all the opinions that any people hold about happiness is a superfluous task For children and the sick and insane have many opinions which no sensible man would discuss, for these persons need not argument but the former time in which to grow up and alter and the latter medical or official chastisement (treatment with drugs being chastisement just as much as flogging is).
σύ τοι τάχ’ οὐκ ἔχουσα τῆς δίκης τέλος ἐμῇ τὸν ἰὸν οὐδὲν ἐχθροῖσιν βαρύν.	Soon, when you have lost the case, you will spit out your venom—no great burden to your enemies.
Κυνίσκῳ δὲ τῷ ἐκ Μαντινείας πύκτῃ παιδὶ ἐποίησε Πολύκλειτος τὴν εἰκόνα.	The statue of Cyniscus, the boy boxer from Mantinea, was made by Polycleitus.
τῶν δὴ πρώτων φιλοσοφησάντων οἱ πλεῖστοι τὰς ἐν ὕλης εἴδει μόνας ᾠήθησαν ἀρχὰς εἶναι πάντων·	most of the earliest philosophers conceived only of material principles as underlying all things.
βούλομαι δὲ καὶ τὴν Νικομάχου εἰκόνα συντελεσθῆναι ἴσην.	It is also my wish that the statue of Nicomachus should be completed of life size.
ἐν ᾠδαῖς καὶ παροιμίαις καὶ παραβολαῖς καὶ ἐν ἑρμηνίᾳ ἀπεθαύμασάν σε χῶραι·	For your songs and proverbs and parables and interpretation, countries marveled at you.
ἐγὼ δὲ τοῦτο μὲν ἔφην πρὸς τοὔνομα μᾶλλον ἐριστικῶς ἢ πρὸς τὸ πρᾶγμα φυσικῶς καὶ μαθηματικῶς ἐνισταμένου·	This instance is rather alleged obstinately against the name, than naturally or mathematically against the thing.
καὶ κατῴκησεν ὁ Ἀσὴρ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Χαναναίου τοῦ κατοικοῦντος τὴν γῆν, ὅτι οὐκ ἠδυνήθη ἐξᾶραι αὐτόν.	And Asher dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites inhabiting the land because he was not strong enough to drive them out.
τὸ δὲ ὑμέτερον τῆς τε δυνάμεως ἐνδεᾶ πρᾶξαι τῆς τε γνώμης μηδὲ τοῖς βεβαίοις πιστεῦσαι τῶν τε δεινῶν μηδέποτε οἴεσθαι ἀπολυθήσεσθαι.	your wont is to attempt less than is justified by your power, to mistrust even what is sanctioned by your judgment, and to fancy that from danger there is no release.
καὶ οἱ μὲν Συρακόσιοι, τοῦ τε Γυλίππου καὶ Ἑρμοκράτους καὶ εἴ του ἄλλου πειθόντων, ὥρμηντό τε ἐς τὴν ναυμαχίαν καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπλήρουν·	and the Syracusans, under the influence of Gylippus and Hermocrates, and perhaps some others, made up their minds for the sea-fight and began to man their vessels.
ὁ δ’ Ἀντώνιος τοὺς ἑτέρους ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐπιβήσας Ἀπολλωνίαν μὲν παρέπλευσεν, ἱστίοις μεστοῖς ἐπιπνέοντος ἀνέμου·	Antony embarked the remainder of the army and sailed for Apollonia with a favorable wind.
Χίοις δὲ ὁ τοῦ Οἰνοπίωνος τάφος θέαν τε παρέχεται καί τινας καὶ λόγους ἐς τοῦ Οἰνοπίωνος τὰ ἔργα·	One of the sights of Chios is the grave of Oenopion, about whose exploits they tell certain legends.
ἔπειτ᾽ ἐπὶ δεκάμνῳ χεσεῖ καθήμενος; ἔγωγε νὴ Δί᾽ ὦπίτριπτ᾽.	would you crap in a thunder - mug that cost ten minae? undoubtedly, you rascal.
Ἀριστοτέλης αἰτίαν κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς ἐν τοῖς καθ’ ὁρμὴν ἕνεκά τινος γινομένοις, ἄδηλον καὶ ἄστατον.	Aristotle, that it is an accidental cause in those things which are done by an impulse to a certain end
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ Πομπήϊος αὐτὸς ἐπέστρεψε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οὕτω πλημμελοῦντας εἰς τὸν Κάτωνα δι’ ἄγνοιαν.	However, Pompey himself put to shame the men who were thus neglectful of Cato through ignorance.
σοφὸς γάρ ἐστιν διανοίᾳ, κραταιός τε καὶ μέγας· τίς σκληρὸς γενόμενος ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὑπέμεινεν;	For he is wise in heart, strong, and also great. Who, having become hardened against him, has endured?
σχεδὸν δ’ οὐδὲ χώρας συμπάσης γεωργία·	Nor can it well be husbandry of land in general
Εἰ δὲ μήγε, ἔτι πόρρω αὐτοῦ ὄντος, πρεσβείαν ἀποστείλας ἐρωτᾷ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην.	"Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
ἔστι δὲ καὶ τὸ τῆς Ἀλκμήνης μνημεῖον ἐγγύς·	And near by is also the memorial of Alcmene
ἡμισφαιρίου γὰρ ὀλίγῳ δοκεῖ μεῖζον εἶναι τὸ περιλαμπόμενον ἑκατέρας.	for what is illuminated both in the one and in the other is little more than an hemisphere.
οὐ γὰρ βουλεύσεως ἐγκαλοῦσιν, οἷς ἀνώμοτος ἡ κακία·	They do not charge me with plotting, for their villainy is bound by no oath.
Αὕτη ἡ ἐπίσκεψις τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κατ᾽ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν· πᾶσα ἡ ἐπίσκεψις τῶν παρεμβολῶν σὺν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν αὐτῶν ἑξακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ τρισχίλιοι πεντακόσιοι πεντήκοντα.	This was the census of the children of Israel according to their ancestral households; the entire census of the encampments together with their hosts: six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
καὶ τούτους μὲν ἀπολέσθαι λοιμώδει νόσῳ φασίν, ἐσοικίσασθαι δὲ μετὰ τοὺς Ἔκτηνας ἐς τὴν χώραν Ὕαντας καὶ Ἄονας, Βοιώτια ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν γένη καὶ οὐκ ἐπηλύδων ἀνθρώπων. Κάδμου δὲ καὶ τῆς Φοινίκων στρατιᾶς ἐπελθούσης μάχῃ νικηθέντες οἱ μὲν Ὕαντες ἐς τὴν νύκτα τὴν ἐπερχομένην ἐκδιδράσκουσι, τοὺς δὲ Ἄονας ὁ Κάδμος γενομένους ἱκέτας καταμεῖναι καὶ ἀναμιχθῆναι τοῖς Φοίνιξιν εἴασε.	The Ectenes perished, they say, by pestilence, and after them there settled in the land the Hyantes and the Aones, who I think were Boeotian tribes and not foreigners.
πότερον οὐχὶ δεινὰ αὐτοῦ στροβήσει ὑμᾶς; ὁ φόβος δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐπιπεσεῖται ὑμῖν,	And so, will not the dread of him distress you, and the fear of him fall upon you?
κεἴ τις δορυξὸς ἢ κάπηλος ἀσπίδων, ἵν᾽ ἐμπολᾷ βέλτιον, ἐπιθυμεῖ μαχῶν ληφθεὶς ὑπὸ λῃστῶν ἐσθίοι κριθὰς μόνας.	if a lance - maker or a dealer in shields desires war for the sake of better trade - may he be taken by pirates and eat nothing but barely.
ἀλλὰ δή τις πόλεμος ἐπὶ Ὁμήρου ὑπ’ ἐκείνου ἄρχοντος ἢ συμβουλεύοντος εὖ πολεμηθεὶς μνημονεύεται;	Well, then, is there any tradition of a war in Homer’s time that was well conducted by his command or counsel?
καὶ προσάξει Ἀαρὼν τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τὸν αὑτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ μόνον, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὑτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ σφάξει τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τὸν αὑτοῦ.	And Aaron will bring forward the young bull for his sin offering, and for his household only, and will make atonement for himself and for his household. And he will slaughter the young bull for his sin offering.
πέφυκε δὲ ἄρα ὡς ἐπίπαν μεταπίπτειν τὰ ἀνθρώπινα, εἰ δὴ Μεσσηνίοις Ἀρκάδας τε ἀντισῶσαι καὶ τὸ ἀδοκητότερον ἔτι ἑλεῖν Σπάρτην ὁ δαίμων ἔδωκεν·	Such, it would seem, are the vicissitudes of human affairs, that it was the will of heaven that the Messenians should in their turn preserve the Arcadians, and what is still more surprising, that they should capture Sparta.
ἐπὶ ταύτῃ Δελφοὶ στᾶσάν φασιν ᾆσαι τοὺς χρησμοὺς γυναῖκα ὄνομα Ἡροφίλην, Σίβυλλαν δὲ ἐπίκλησιν.	On it, say the Delphians, there stood and chanted the oracles a woman, by name Herophile and surnamed Sibyl.
νῦν οὖν πορευθέντες ἐργάζεσθε· τὸ γὰρ ἄχυρον οὐ δοθήσεται ὑμῖν, καὶ τὴν σύνταξιν τῆς πλινθίας ἀποδώσετε.	Now, therefore, go on your way and do your work! For the straw will not be given to you, and you will deliver the quota of brickmaking!”
ἀλλὰ τὸ αἴτιον ἐν τῇ σκιᾷ τῆς διαφορᾶς ἔστιν·	But the cause of the difference is in the shadow, which is, like pyramids, broadest at the bottom or basis
καὶ προσηυξάμεθα πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐστήσαμεν προφύλακας ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν.	And we prayed to our God and set up an advance guard against them day and night because of their presence.
ἐπιβουλεύουσα δὲ ὕστερον Θησεῖ φυγὰς ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς ἐκβάλλεται.	Afterwards, however, plotting against Theseus, she was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son.
Τέκμησσα πῶς δῆτα λέγω λόγον ἄρρητον; θανάτῳ γὰρ ἴσον βάρος ἐκπεύσει. μανίᾳ γὰρ ἁλοὺς ἡμὶν ὁ κλεινὸς νύκτερος Αἴας ἀπελωβήθη. τοιαῦτ᾽ ἂν ἴδοις σκηνῆς ἔνδον χειροδάϊκτα σφάγι᾽ αἱμοβαφῆ, κείνου χρηστήρια τἀνδρός.	Tecmessa How then do I tell an unutterable tale? For what you will hear is equal to death. Seized by madness our illustrious Ajax was grievously insulted during the night. All these things you may see inside the tent, victims slain by hand and bathed in blood, the sacrifices of that man.
ἄλλη πατρὸς πρὸς υἱὸν καὶ ἀνδρὸς πρὸς γυναῖκα, αὕτη μὲν ὡς ἄρχοντος καὶ ἀρχομένου, ἣ δὲ εὐεργέτου πρὸς εὐεργετηθέντα.	the friendship of father for son is different from that of husband for wife - the former is friendship as between ruler and subject, the latter that of benefactor for beneficiary.
καὶ ὑπέδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἣν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῷ περιέθηκεν, καὶ ὡς ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν πρωτεύειν καὶ ἡγεῖσθαι τῆς βασιλείας.	And he told them about his wealth and the glory that the king had invested in him and how he had made him to have the first place and to lead the kingdom.
ταῖς μὲν οὐν πύλαις ἐπέστησε τοὺς τὸν ἐκπίπτοντα καὶ προλείποντα τὴν πόλιν ὄχλον ἀπείρξοντας, πένθους δὲ καὶ τόπον καὶ χρόνον ὥρισε, κατ’ οἰκίαν ἀποθρηνεῖν κελεύσας ἐφ’ ἡμέρας τριάκοντα τὸν βουλόμενον·	Accordingly, he put guards at the gates, in order to keep the frightened throng from abandoning the city, and set limits of time and place to the mourning for the dead, ordering any who wished to indulge in lamentation, to do so at home for a period of thirty days
κάρβανος ὢν δ᾽ Ἕλλησιν ἐγχλίεις ἄγαν·	for a barbarian dealing with hellenes, you act insolently.
ἐγένοντο δὲ καὶ βρόμοι τῆς Αἴτνης σκληροὶ καὶ μυκήματα μακρὰ καὶ σέλα περιλάμποντα τὴν στρατιάν, ὥστε τοὺς μὲν Γερμανοὺς ἐξ εὐνίων ἀναπηδᾶν ὑπὸ δέους, τοὺς δέ, ἀκοῇ τῶν περὶ τῆς Αἴτνης λεγομένων, οὐκ ἀπιστεῖν ἐν τοσοῖσδε παραδόξοις ἐμπεσεῖσθαι σφίσι καὶ τὸν ῥύακα.	Others, who had heard what had been related of Mount Etna, would not have been surprised, in presence of these remarkable phenomena, if a torrent of fire had rolled upon them.
οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ παρὲξ τῶν ἱερέων, οὐκ ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ τοῦ ἁγίου εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν, ὅπως διὰ παντὸς ἅγιοι ὦσιν οἱ προσάγοντες· καὶ μὴ ἅπτωνται τοῦ στολισμοῦ αὐτῶν ἐν οἷς λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, διότι ἅγιά ἐστιν· καὶ ἐνδύσονται ἱμάτια ἕτερα ὅταν ἅπτωνται τοῦ λαοῦ.	Besides the priests no one will enter there; they will not go out from the sanctuary into the outer court, so that those who approach should be continually holy, and they should not touch their clothing in which they minister, since they are holy, and they will put on other garments when they touch the people.”
καὶ οἱ μέν, ὡς ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς ταῦτα, καὶ ἐποίησαν·	This was no sooner settled than carried into effect
ἔχει δὲ πρὸς μὲν ἄρκτῳ δρυμούς, δι’ ὧν ὁ Ῥασκούπολις ἤγαγε τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὸν Βροῦτον·	On the east are the gorges of the Sapæans and Corpileans, and on the west a very fertile and beautiful plain extending to the towns of Murcinus and Drabiscus and the river Strymon, about 350 stades.
καὶ συνήχθησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες λοιμοὶ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, ἄνδρες παράνομοι, ἐντυχεῖν κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐ προσέσχεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς.	And some sinister men from Israel gathered against him, wicked men, to gain audience against him, and the king did not heed them.
οὐ πεινάσουσιν, οὐδὲ διψάσουσιν, οὐδὲ πατάξει αὐτοὺς καύσων οὐδὲ ὁ ἥλιος, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ ἐλεῶν αὐτοὺς παρακαλέσει, καὶ διὰ πηγῶν ὑδάτων ἄξει αὐτούς·	They will not hunger or thirst, and the burning heat and the sun will not strike them, but the one who shows mercy will comfort them, and he will lead them through springs of waters.
καίτοι φιλία γέ τίς με καὶ αἰδὼς ἐκ παιδὸς ἔχουσα περὶ Ὁμήρου ἀποκωλύει λέγειν.	I must speak out, I said, though a certain love and reverence for Homer that has possessed me from a boy would stay me from speaking.
στοὰν δὲ τῆς ἀγορᾶς ὀνομαζομένην Φιλίππειον οὐ Φίλιππος ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἀμύντου, χαριζόμενοι δέ οἱ Μεγαλοπολῖται τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν διδόασιν αὐτῷ τοῦ οἰκοδομήματος.	The portico of the marketplace, called the Philippeium, was not made by Philip, the son of Amyntas, but as a compliment to him the Megalopolitans gave his name to the building.
Ἐὰν οὖν, φημί, κύριε, μετὰ τὸ ἀπολυθῆναι τὴν γυναῖκα μετανοήσῃ ἡ γυνὴ καὶ θελήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸν ἑαυτῆς ἄνδρα ὑποστρέψαι, οὐ παραδεχθήσεται;	If then, said I, sir, after the wife be put away she repent, and wish to return to her own husband, shall she not be received?
διὸ τῇ μὲν κεφαλῇ τοῦ ἱερείου καταρασάμενοι καὶ ἀποκόψαντες εἰς τὸν ποταμὸν ἐρρίπτουν πάλαι, νῦν δὲ τοῖς ξένοις ἀποδίδονται.	Wherefore in the more ancient times they were wont, after they had pronounced a solemn curse upon the head of the sacrifice, and had cut it off, to fling it into the river Nile
καὶ γὰρ πατὴρ καὶ ἀνὴρ ὢν καὶ βασιλεὺς αὐτὸς ἅμα καὶ ἰατρὸς εἴη τῆς οἰκίας ἄριστος.	for as father, husband, and king, he was himself at the same time the best physician also for his household.
ὅλη γὰρ ἡ περὶ φύσεως ἀνῄρηται σκέψις.	on this view the whole study of physics is abolished.
ὅσοι δὲ τοῦ Βάρκα διαπολῖται τὴν Βάρκα τε καὶ Ἀσδρούβα δύναμιν ἐδεδοίκεσαν, ὡς ἔμαθον αὐτοὺς τεθνεῶτας, Ἀννίβα κατεφρόνουν ὡς νέου, καὶ τοὺς ἐκείνων φίλους τε καὶ στασιώτας ἐδίωκον ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐκείνων ἐγκλήμασιν.	Those of the opposite faction, who had feared the power of Hamilcar and Hasdrubal, when they learned of their death, despised Hannibal on account of his youth and prosecuted their friends and partisans with the old charges.
καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ἰερουσαλὴμ τὸν ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Μοσοάθ, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμὼν βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ προσοχθίσματι Σιδωνίων καὶ τῷ Χαμὼς προσοχθίσματι Μωὰβ καὶ τῷ Μολχὸλ βδελύγματι υἱῶν Ἀμμών, ἐμίανεν ὁ βασιλεύς.	The king defiled the house that was in front of Jerusalem to the right of the mountain of Destruction that Solomon, king of Israel, built for Astarte, the idol of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, the idol of Moab, and Milcom, the idol of the descendants of Ammon.
ἔχει γὰρ οὖν δή, ἔφη, οὕτως.	Why, yes, he said, that is so.
Καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ εἰπόντος, ἀπῆλθον οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, πολλὴν ἔχοντες ἐν ἑαυτοῖς συζήτησιν.	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.
Ῥόδιοι δὲ οὐχ ὁμολογοῦντες Λακεδαιμονίοις φασὶν Ἑλένην Μενελάου τελευτήσαντος, Ὀρέστου δὲ ἔτι πλανωμένου, τηνικαῦτα ὑπὸ Νικοστράτου καὶ Μεγαπένθους διωχθεῖσαν ἐς Ῥόδον ἀφικέσθαι Πολυξοῖ τῇ Τληπολέμου γυναικὶ ἔχουσαν ἐπιτηδείως·	The account of the Rhodians is different. They say that when Menelaus was dead, and Orestes still a wanderer, Helen was driven out by Nicostratus and Megapenthes and came to Rhodes, where she had a friend in Polyxo,
εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς καθ᾽ ὕπνον Κἀγὼ ἔγνων ὅτι ἐν καθαρᾷ καρδίᾳ ἐποίησας τοῦτο, καὶ ἐφεισάμην ἐγώ σου τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτεῖν σε εἰς ἐμέ· ἕνεκεν τούτου οὐκ ἀφῆκά σε ἅψασθαι αὐτῆς.	And God spoke to him during his sleep, “And I knew that with a pure heart you did this, and I spared you so that you might not sin in regard to me. For this reason I did not permit you to touch her.
ἀποροῦντες οὖν ταῦτα οἱ Ἀργεῖοι, καὶ φοβούμενοι μὴ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Τεγεάταις, Βοιωτοῖς καὶ Ἀθηναίοις ἅμα πολεμῶσι, πρότερον οὐ δεχόμενοι τὰς Λακεδαιμονίων σπονδάς, ἀλλ’ ἐν φρονήματι ὄντες τῆς Πελοποννήσου ἡγήσεσθαι, ἔπεμπον ὡς ἐδύναντο τάχιστα ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πρέσβεις Εὔστροφον καὶ Αἴσωνα, οἳ ἐδόκουν προσφιλέστατοι αὐτοῖς εἶναι, ἡγούμενοι ἐκ τῶν παρόντων κράτιστα πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους σπονδὰς ποιησάμενοι, ὅπῃ ἂν ξυγχωρῇ, ἡσυχίαν ἔχειν.	In this strait the Argives, afraid that, as the result of refusing to renew the treaty with Lacedaemon and aspiring to the supremacy in Peloponnese, they would have the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians on their hands all at once, now hastily sent off Eustrophus and Aeson, who seemed the persons most likely to be acceptable, as envoys to Lacedaemon, with the view of making as good a treaty as they could with the Lacedaemonians, upon such terms as could be got, and being left in peace.
περιθέων δ’ αὐτοὺς ὁ Λεύκιος ἐδεῖτο μὴ ψυχομαχεῖν ἔτι καὶ οἰμῴζοντας ἀπῆγεν ἄκοντας.	Lucius ran among them and besought them to sacrifice their lives no longer, and led them back groaning and reluctant.
εἴ τε καὶ ἁλοίη, τιμωρησαμένῳ κάλλιον ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ ταῦτα πάσχειν, ἢ ἀνάνδρως μηδὲν ἀντιδράσαντα ὑπὸ τῆς γραφῆς διαφθαρῆναι.	while in the event of his losing his case after all, he considered it better to have revenged himself for his defeat than, like a coward, to be ruined by the indictment without retaliating.
κατὰ τὴν Μυουσίαν χώραν θαλάσσης κόλπος ἐσεῖχεν οὐ μέγας·	A small inlet of the sea used to run into their land.
καὶ καλὸν γευσαμένους θεοῦ ῥῆμα, δυνάμεις τε μέλλοντος αἰῶνος,	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀναρρηθέντα στέφανον οὐδεὶς καθιεροῖ, ἀλλ’ ἔξεστι κεκτῆσθαι, ἵνα μὴ μόνον αὐτός, ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ ἐξ ἐκείνου, ἔχοντες ἐν τῇ οἰκία τὸ ὑπόμνημα, μηδέποτε κακοὶ τὴν ψυχὴν εἰς τὸν δῆμον γίγνωνται.	But the other crown, the crown that is proclaimed in the assembly, no one dedicates, but he is permitted to keep it, that not only he, but also his descendants, having the memorial in their house, may never become disloyal to the democracy.
Καὶ ἐποίησεν Βεσελεὴλ καὶ Ἐλιὰβ καὶ πᾶς σοφὸς τῇ διανοὶᾳ, ᾧ ἐδόθη σοφία καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἐν αὐτοῖς συνιέναι ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔργα κατὰ τὰ ἅγια καθήκοντα, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα συνέταξεν Κύριος.	“And so Bezalel will do, and Oholiab, and every one skilled in comprehension, to whom was given wisdom and understanding in them to bring them together to do all the projects for the holy things as assigned, according to everything which the Lord has commanded.”
ἐπεβίωσε δ’ οὖν ὁ Σόλων ἀρξαμένου τοῦ Πεισιστράτου τυραννεῖν, ὡς μὲν Ἡρακλείδης ὁ Ποντικὸς ἱστορεῖ, συχνὸν χρόνον, ὡς δὲ Φανίας ὁ Ἐρέσιος, ἐλάττονα δυοῖν ἐτῶν. ἐπὶ Κωμίου μὲν γὰρ ἤρξατο τυραννεῖν Πεισιστρατος, ἐφ’ Ἡγεστράτου δὲ Σόλωνά φησιν ὁ Φανίας ἀποθανεῖν τοῦ μετὰ Κωμίαν ἄρξαντος.	Well, then, Solon lived on after Peisistratus had made himself tyrant, as Hercleides Ponticus states, a long time; but as Phanias of Eresos says, less than two years. For it was in the archonship of Comeas that Peisistratus began his tyranny, and Phanias says that Solon died in the archonship of Hegestratus, the successor of Comeas.
πάντα ὅσα εἴρηκα πρὸς ὑμᾶς φυλάξασθε· καὶ ὄνομα θεῶν ἑτέρων οὐκ ἀναμνησθήσεσθε, οὐδὲ μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν.	You will observe all the things that I have spoken to you, and you will not bring to mind the name of other gods; it will not even be heard coming out of your mouth.
ὁ μέν γὰρ Παιδάρητος οὐκ ἐγκριθεὶς εἰς τοὺς τριακοσίους ἀπῄει μάλα φαιδρός, ὥσπερ χαίρων ὅτι βελτίονας αὐτοῦ τριακοσίους ἡ πόλις ἔχει· Πολυκρατίδας δὲ ὁ πρεσβεύων πρὸς τοὺς βασιλέως στρατηγοὺς μεθ’ ἑτέρων, ἐρομένων αὐτῶν πότερον ἰδίᾳ πάρεισιν ἢ δημοσίᾳ πεμφθέντες, εἶπεν, αἴκα τύχω μέν, δημοσίᾳ, Αἴκα ἀποτύχωμεν, ἰδίᾳ.	For instance, Paedaretus, when he failed to be chosen among the three hundred best men, went away with a very glad countenance, as if rejoicing that the city had three hundred better men than himself. And again, Polycratidas, one of an embassy to the generals of the Persian king, on being asked by them whether the embassy was there in a private or a public capacity, replied: If we succeed, in a public capacity; if we fail, in a private.
ἐπ’ ἄλλοισι δ’ ἄλλοι μεγάλοι.	Some men are great in one thing, others in another
καὶ νῦν σχεδὸν οἶσθ’ ὅτι μέλλω τοῦτο λέγειν, καὶ πρὸς τούτῳ ὅτι αὐτὴν οὐχ ἱκανῶς ἴσμεν·	And now I am almost sure you know that this is what I am going to speak of and to say further that we have no adequate knowledge of it.
τρίτος δέ ποτε ἐν σπηλαίῳ κρυπτόμενος ἔλαθε, τῶν πολεμίων περὶ τὸ σπήλαιον στρατοπεδευόντων. οὐδ’ ἔστιν ὅτε ἐστάθμευεν ἐν στρατοπέδῳ, ἀλλὰ καὶ μάλιστ’ ἐστρατήγει λανθάνειν ὅποι ποτε εἴη.	Often, when surrounded, he divided his forces so that they might scatter as best they could, concealing himself with a handful until they should all come together again, by day or by night, at an appointed rendezvous Once he was one of three who lay concealed in a cave around which his enemies were encamped. He never had any fixed camping-place. His generalship consisted especially in concealing his position.
ὅπως ἀναφέρωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν ὅσας ἂν αὐτοὶ σφάξουσιν ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις, καὶ οἴσουσιν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ θύσουσιν θυσίαν σωτηρίου τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτά·	This is so that the children of Israel will bring and present their sacrifices, whatever they themselves will slaughter in the fields and will bring to the Lord at the entrances of the tent of the testimony to the priest. And they will sacrifice them as a sacrifice of peace to the Lord.
καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ θέλῃς αὐτήν, ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὴν ἐλευθέραν, καὶ πράσει οὐ πραθήσεται ἀργυρίου· οὐκ ἀθετήσεις αὐτήν, διότι ἐταπείνωσας αὐτήν.	And if it is that you do not desire her, you may release her free, and you shall not sell her for money by a sale. You shall not break faith with her, because you humbled her.”
Τοῦτο γὰρ φρονείσθω ἐν ὑμῖν ὃ καὶ ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ·	Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
εἰώθει τε νεανίσκων τινῶν υἱοθεσίας ποιεῖσθαι εἰς τὸ ἀποχρῆσθαι αὐτοῖς ἔς τε τὰς ἡδονὰς καὶ ὥστε φυλάττεσθαι ὑπ’ εὐνοίας αὐτῶν·	It was his custom also to adopt certain young men for the gratification of his appetite and in order that he might be protected by their goodwill.
Τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἐμὰ τῆς φωνῆς μου ἀκούει, κἀγὼ γινώσκω αὐτά, καὶ ἀκολουθοῦσίν μοι·	"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
ἄλλοτε δὲ ὑπὸ τῇσι νοθῇσι ἐνθάδε καὶ ἔνθα, ὡς δοκέειν τὴν ὀδύνην ἥπατος ἢ σπληνὸς ἔμμεναι ·	but sometimes it extends to the false ribs, on this side or on that, so that the pain appears to be seated in the liver and spleen
τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοὶ σύμβουλε τοῦ ἁγίου υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ;	What have we to do with thee, thou counsellor of the holy Son of God?
ταύτην τοίνυν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, τὴν εἰκόνα, ὦ φίλε Γλαύκων, προσαπτέον ἅπασαν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν λεγομένοις, τὴν μὲν δι’ ὄψεως φαινομένην ἕδραν τῇ τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου οἰκήσει ἀφομοιοῦντα, τὸ δὲ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐν αὐτῇ φῶς τῇ τοῦ ἡλίου δυνάμει·	“This image then, dear Glaucon, we must apply as a whole to all that has been said, likening the region revealed through sight to the habitation of the prison, and the light of the fire in it to the power of the sun.
ἔνθα δ’ ἐοῦσα δεσπόσσεις πάντων ὁπόσα ζώει τε καὶ ἕρπει, τιμὰς δὲ σχήσησθα μετ’ ἀθανάτοισι μεγίστας.	And while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεός Συναχθήτω τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς συναγωγὴν μίαν, καὶ ὀφθήτω ἡ ξηρά· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως. καὶ συνήχθη τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὤφθη ἡ ξηρά.	And God said, “Let the water that is under the heaven be gathered together into one aggregation, and let the dryness appear.” And it happened in this way. And the water that is under the heaven was brought together into their aggregation, and the dryness appeared.
ἐσῄει δὲ ἐς τὴν πόλιν σοβαρῶς, τὴν μὲν ἴλην πρὸ τοῦ ἄστεως στρατοπεδεύσας, τοὺς δ’ ἀμφ’ αὑτὸν ἔχων ὑπεζωσμένους καὶ τὴν οἰκίαν νυκτοφυλακοῦντας ἐνόπλους·	He entered the city in a haughty manner leaving his squadron of horse encamped outside the walls.
οὐ γὰρ ξυνίεσαν ὥνθρωποι τὸ ξυνὸν τοῦ κακοῦ τοῦ λοιμώδεος πρὸς τὰ δηλητήρ ια.	for these persons did not perceive the affinity between a pestilential disease and deleterious substances.
καὶ ὠργίσθη Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐπισκόποις τῆς δυνάμεως, χιλιάρχοις καὶ ἑκατοντάρχοις τοῖς ἐρχομένοις ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως τοῦ πολέμου·	And Moses was incensed at the commanders of the military forces, the leaders over thousands and the leaders over hundreds, with those coming from the battle engagements of the war.
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ οἰκοδομῶ οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου θεοῦ μου, ἁγιάσαι αὐτὸν αὐτῷ τοῦ θυμιᾷν ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ θυμίαμα καὶ πρόθεσιν διὰ παντός, καὶ τοῦ ἀναφέρειν ὁλοκαυτώματα διὰ παντὸς τὸ πρωὶ καὶ τὸ δεὶλης, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις καὶ ἐν ταῖς νουμηνίαις καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ ἡμῶν, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦτο ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ.	behold, I, his son, will build a house to the name of the Lord, my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn incense before him and offering ⌊always⌋, and to bring whole burnt offerings ⌊always⌋, in the morning and in the evening and on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and at the festivals for the Lord our God; this is upon Israel ⌊forever⌋.
Μοῦσαι γάρ μ’ ἐδίδαξαν ἀθέσφατον ὕμνον ἀείδειν.	for the Muses have taught me to sing in marvellous song.
τὰς φρένας ἢν ἐθέλῃς τὰς Πυθαγόραο νοῆσαι, ἀσπίδος Εὐφόρβου βλέψον ἐς ὀμφάλιον.	If thou wouldst know the mind of old Pythagoras, Look on Euphorbus’ buckler and its boss.
καὶ ὡς ἐγίνετο ὄρθρος, ἐρχόμενοι ἔκλεπτον ἀλλήλους σπεύδοντες, τίς φανήσεται αὐτῇ πρότερος καὶ λαλήσει πρὸς αὐτήν.	And when early morning came, they came in haste to see who would appear to her first and speak with her.
ἐὰν μὲν τοίνυν ἀποδείξῃ, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, ὡς ἔστι νόμος ὃς κελεύει τοὺς σιτοπώλας συνωνεῖσθαι τὸν σῖτον, ἐὰν οἱ ἄρχοντες κελεύωσιν, ἀποψηφίσασθε·	Well now, gentlemen, if he proves that there is a law which orders the corn-dealers to buy up the corn on an order from the magistrates, acquit him
Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Καὶ λήμψομαι ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν τῆς κέδρου ἐκ κορυφῆς, καρδίας αὐτῶν ἀποκνιῶ καὶ καταφυτεύσω ἐγὼ ἐπ᾽ ὄρος ὑψηλόν,	“ ‘Because this is what the Lord says: “I will also take some of the choice ones of the cedar from the top; I will nip off their hearts, and plant them on a high mountain
τοιγάρτοι, ἔφην, ἅτε σοφοὶ ὄντες οἱ τῆς τραγῳδίας ποιηταὶ συγγιγνώσκουσιν ἡμῖν τε καὶ ἐκείνοις ὅσοι ἡμῶν ἐγγὺς πολιτεύονται, ὅτι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν πολιτείαν οὐ παραδεξόμεθα ἅτε τυραννίδος ὑμνητάς.	Wherefore, said I, being wise as they are, the poets of tragedy will pardon us and those whose politics resemble ours for not admitting them into our polity, since they hymn the praises of tyranny.
βέλτιον ἐμὲ καρπίζεσθαι ὑπὲρ χρυσίον καὶ λίθον τίμιον, τὰ δὲ ἐμὰ γενήματα κρείσσω ἀργυρίου ἐκλεκτοῦ.	enjoyment of my fruits is better than gold or a precious stone, and my products are better than choicest silver.
γίνεσθαι μέντοι τὸ κωνοειδὲς τοῦ ἀέρος πρὸς τῇ ὄψει, τὴν δὲ βάσιν πρὸς τῷ ὁρωμένῳ·	The apex of the cone in the air is at the eye, the base at the object seen.
ἐλάττους γάρ εἰσιν οἱ πλούσιοι τῶν πενήτων.	for the rich are fewer than the poor.
τὸ δὲ ἐπίγραμμα τὸ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς ἀριθμεῖ τὰς πόλεις ἀφ’ ὧν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ ἀκροθίνια ἀπέστειλαν, τήν τε Ἠλείων καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων Σικυῶνά τε καὶ Μέγαρα καὶ Πελληνέας Ἀχαιῶν Ἀμβρακίαν τε καὶ Λευκάδα καὶ αὐτὴν Κόρινθον·	The inscription on them enumerates the cities from which the Athenians sent the first-fruits Elis, Lacedaemon, Sicyon, Megara, Pellene in Achaia, Ambracia, Leucas, and Corinth itself.
κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω ἐπὶ τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ.	I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
Ἄπελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω: καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς ἔθνος μέγα καὶ εὐλογήσω σε καὶ μεγαλυνῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ ἔσῃ εὐλογημένος:	Depart from your land and from your kindred and from your father’s house to the land which I shall show you, and I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will magnify your name, and you shall be blessed;
εὐλογήσω τοὺς εὐλογοῦντάς σε καὶ καταράσομαι τοὺς καταρωμένους σε, καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς.	I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in you.
ὡς δὲ καὶ τῇδε συμβαλὼν ἑπτακοσίους τε ἀπώλεσε, καὶ τὸν τὴν ἀγορὰν αὐτῷ φέροντα χιλίαρχον οἱ Τερμεντεῖς ἐτρέψαντο, καὶ τρίτῃ πείρᾳ κατὰ τὴν αὐτὴν ἡμέραν ἐς ἀπόκρημνα τοὺς Ῥωμαίους συνελάσαντες πολλοὺς αὐτῶν πεζούς τε καὶ ἱππέας αὐτοῖς ἵπποις κατέωσαν ἐς τὰ ἀπόκρημνα, περιφόβως ἔχοντες οἱ λοιποὶ διενυκτέρευον ἔνοπλοι, καὶ ἅμα ἕῳ προσιόντων τῶν πολεμίων ἐκταξάμενοι τὴν ἡμέραν ὅλην ἠγωνίζοντο ἀγχωμάλως, καὶ διεκρίθησαν ὑπὸ νυκτός.	In a third engagement the same day they drove the Romans into a rocky place where many of their infantry and cavalry with their horses were forced down a precipice.
τίνες οὖν εἰσιν αὗται πλὴν θερμότης καὶ ψυχρότης καὶ ξηρότης καὶ ὑγρότης, αἷς τὰ στοιχεῖα πάσχειν ἅπαντα καὶ ποιεῖν πέφυκεν;	And what are they but heat and cold, drought and moisture, by virtue of which it comes to pass that all the principles act and suffer?
τοὺς δὲ Ἀθηναίους σπουδάζων ἐλευθερῶσαι διεβλήθη καὶ κακῶς ἤκουσεν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν, ὅτι σπονδὰς πεποιημένων αὐτῶν πρὸς τοὺς Μακεδόνας καὶ ἀνοχὰς ἀγόντων ἐπεχείρησε τὸν Πειραιᾶ καταλαβεῖν.	But in his eagerness to set Athens free he incurred the bitter reproaches of the Achaeans, because, though they had made a truce and suspended hostilities with the Macedonians, he attempted to seize the Peiraeus.
φόνου δ’ ἀγόμενος ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς ἀπελύθη τοῦ ἐγκλήματος·	for she was betrothed, it seems, to Demodicus, one of the brothers, that was now slain.
πάντα τοι πέπραγας οἷα χρὴ τὸν εὐτυχοῦντα· ηὗρε δ᾽ ὁ πανοῦργος ἕτερον πολὺ πανουργίαις μείζοσι κεκασμένον καὶ δόλοισι ποικίλοις ῥήμασίν θ᾽ αἱμύλοις. ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως ἀγωνιεῖ φρόντιζε τἀπίλοιπ᾽ ἄριστα· συμμάχους δ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἔχων εὔνους ἐπίστασαι πάλαι. καὶ μὴν ὁ Παφλαγὼν οὑτοσὶ προσέρχεται, ὠθῶν κολόκυμα καὶ ταράττων καὶ κυκῶν, ὡς δὴ καταπιόμενός με.	singing bravo! you are the spoilt child of fortune. ah! our knave has found his match in another, who has far better tricks in his sack, a thousand kinds of knaveries and of wily words. but the fight begins afresh; take care not to weaken; you know that i have long been your most faithful ally. ah! ah! here comes the paphlagonian! one would say it was a hurricane lashing the sea and rolling the waves before it in its fury. he looks as if he wanted
πῶς γὰρ τὸ ἀγαθῶν αἴτιον ἡμῖν συμπάντων οὐ καὶ τοῦ πολὺ μεγίστου, τῆς φρονήσεως, αἴτιον ἡγεῖσθαι δεῖ γεγονέναι;	for why should we not believe the cause of all the good things that are ours to have been the cause also of what is far the greatest, understanding?
ἡ μὲν διὰ στόματος ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς καὶ τῶν τῇδε ἀγγείων ·	The one that by the mouth from the head and the vessels there
καὶ πλάτος τοῦ χώματος τὸ μὲν ἄνω τεσσάρων καὶ εἴκοσι ποδῶν, τὸ δ’ ἐς τὸν βυθὸν καὶ τετραπλάσιον ἦν.	The embankment was twenty-four feet wide on the top and four times as much on the bottom.
Αὐτεσίωνος γὰρ θυγατέρα Ἀριστόδημος ἔγημεν ὄνομα Ἀργείαν.	He was at that time guardian of the sons of Aristodemus, being their uncle on the mother's side, Aristodemus having married a daughter of Autesion, called Argeia.
Κιναίθων δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσιν ἐποίησεν ὡς Ῥαδάμανθυς μὲν Ἡφαίστου, Ἥφαιστος δὲ εἴη Τάλω, Τάλων δὲ εἶναι Κρητὸς παῖδα.	Cinaethon too in his poem represents Rhadamanthys as the son of Hephaestus, Hephaestus as a son of Talos, and Talos as a son of Cres.
ὁ ᾅδης κάτωθεν ἐπικράνθη συναντήσας σοι· συνηγέρθησάν σοι πάντες οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ἄρξαντες τῆς γῆς, οἱ ἐγείραντες ἐκ τῶν θρόνων αὐτῶν πάντας βασιλεῖς ἐθνῶν.	Hades below was embittered after meeting you; all the giants who ruled the land, who roused all the kings of the nations from their thrones, rose together with you.
ἤδη δ’ αὐτοῦ πλησίον ὄντος ἀκούσας ὁ Νάβις οὐχ ὑπέστη, καίπερ ἐν τῇ πόλει στρατοπεδεύων, ἀλλ’ ὑπεκδὺς διὰ πυλῶν ἑτέρων κατὰ τάχος ἀπήγαγε τὴν δύναμιν, εὐτυχίᾳ χρήσεσθαι δοκῶν εἰ διαφύγοι·	And when Nabis heard that Philopoemen was already close at hand, he did not wait for him to come up, although he was encamped in the city, but stole out by an opposite gate and led his forces off as fast as he could, thinking that he would be fortunate if he should escape
νομοθετήσεις δὴ αὐτοῖς ταύτης μάλιστα τῆς παιδείας ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι, ἐξ ἧς ἐρωτᾶν τε καὶ ἀποκρίνεσθαι ἐπιστημονέστατα οἷοί τ’ ἔσονται; νομοθετήσω, ἔφη, μετά γε σοῦ.	“Then you will provide by law that they shall give special heed to the discipline that will enable them to ask and answer questions in the most scientific manner?” “I will so legislate,” he said, “in conjunction with you.”
καὶ ἄρτι ἄρα ἐκείνῳ συγγεγονὼς ἥκεις;	And it was his company that you left just now?
ὥστε πολὺ μᾶλλον τοῦτον παραλαμβάνειν ἐχρῆν ἢ ἐμὲ παραδοῦναι προσῆκεν.	It behoved him, therefore, much rather to take them than it suited me to deliver them.
ἐπεὶ τοίνυν ἅπαν μόριον τῇ γαστρὶ ὁμοίως ὀρέγεται τρέφεσθαι, καὶ περιπτύσσεται τῇ τροφῇ καὶ οὕτω σφίγγει πανταχόθεν αὐτὴν ὡς ἡ γαστήρ.	Since, therefore, every part has, like the stomach, a craving to be nourished, it too envelops its nutriment and clasps it all round as the stomach does.
εἰ γάρ τι καὶ στερεὸν εἴη κατὰ μέσον τοῦ παντὸς ἰσοπαλές, εἰς οὐδὲν ἄν ποτε τῶν ἐσχάτων ἐνεχθείη διὰ τὴν πάντῃ ὁμοιότητα αὐτῶν·	For suppose there were a solid body evenly-balanced at the center of the universe, it would never be carried away to the extremities because of their uniformity in all respects
φεύγειν δὲ ὁρμηθέντι αὐτῷ διὰ τῆς Σικελικῆς θαλάσσης Ζεὺς ἐπέρριψεν Αἴτνην ὄρος ἐν Σικελίᾳ·	And when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him.
οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἐβλήθη ἀτρεμίζων καὶ μὴ διατρέχων.	had he stood still and not run across, he would not have been struck.
ἐν μὲν γὰρ τοῖς παρελθοῦσι χρόνοις ἐθαύμαζόν σου τήν τε φύσιν καὶ τὴν τοῦ βίου τάξιν καὶ τὴν φιλοπονίαν καὶ μάλιστα τὴν ἀλήθειαν τῆς φιλοσοφίας, νῦν δὲ ζηλῶ σε καὶ μακαρίζω τῆς εὐδαιμονίας·	For in time past I admired your natural endowments and the manner in which you ordered your life and your devotion to work and above all the truth of your teaching, but now I envy and congratulate you because of your good fortune.
καὶ λέγω γε ὅτι οὐκ ἂν θαυμάζοιμι εἰ τῶν ἐλλογίμων γένοιο ἀνδρῶν ἐπὶ σοφίᾳ.	and I say I should not be surprised if you won high repute for wisdom.
καὶ ποιήσεις ὁλοκαυτώματα Κυρίῳ, ὁλοκάρπωμα ἢ θυσίαν, μεγαλῦναι εὐχὴν ἢ καθ᾽ ἑκούσιον, ἢ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς ὑμῶν ποιῆσαι ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ, εἰ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων·	and you will prepare whole burnt offerings to the Lord, a whole burnt offering or a sacrifice to honor a vow or with respect to a voluntary offering or during your feasts, in order to make a sweet-smelling aroma to the Lord, whether from herd animals or from flock animals.
τάδε γὰρ ἐφαίνετο εἰκότα εἶναί μοι μᾶλλον ἢ ὁ πρότερος λόγος, ἐν ᾧ βασιλεύειν τε Ἀχαιῶν τηνικαῦτα Ὀρέστην ἔγραψα καὶ Ὕλλον Ὀρέστου βασιλεύοντος ἀποπειρᾶσαι καθόδου τῆς ἐς Πελοπόννησον.	I have come to the conclusion that this is a more probable story than the one I gave before, that on this occasion Orestes was king of the Achaeans, and that it was during his reign that Hyllus attempted to return to the Peloponnesus.
μάλιστα δὲ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἐγεγένητό τις ῥώμη, διότι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐνόμιζον διπλοῦν τὸν πόλεμον ἔχοντας, πρός τε σφᾶς καὶ Σικελιώτας, εὐκαθαιρετωτέρους ἔσεσθαι, καὶ ὅτι τὰς σπονδὰς προτέρους λελυκέναι ἡγοῦντο αὐτούς·	But the Lacedaemonians derived most encouragement from the belief that Athens, with two wars on her hands, against themselves and against the Siceliots, would be more easy to subdue, and from the conviction that she had been the first to infringe the truce.
τὸ δὲ ἐντεῦθεν τοῖς ἐντὸς τοῦ ἀδύτου γενομένοις οὐχ εἷς οὐδὲ ὁ αὐτὸς τρόπος ἐστὶν ὅτῳ διδάσκονται τὰ μέλλοντα, ἀλλά πού τις καὶ εἶδε καὶ ἄλλος ἤκουσεν.	After this those who have entered the shrine learn the future, not in one and the same way in all cases, but by sight sometimes and at other times by hearing.
εἰπεῖν τὸν Παρμενίδην, οὐκ ἀνάγκῃ ᾗ τἆλλα φῂς τῶν εἰδῶν μετέχειν ἢ δοκεῖ σοι ἐκ νοημάτων ἕκαστον εἶναι καὶ πάντα νοεῖν, ἢ νοήματα ὄντα ἀνόητα εἶναι;	Well then, said Parmenides, does not the necessity which compels you to say that all other things partake of ideas, oblige you also to believe either that everything is made of thoughts, and all things think, or that, being thoughts, they are without thought?
πᾶσαν οὖν ἀπαρχὴν γεννημάτων ληνοῦ καὶ ἅλωνος, βοῶν τε καὶ προβάτων λαβὼν δώσεις τὴν ἀπαρχὴν τοῖς προφήταις: αὐτοὶ γάρ εἰσιν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς ὑμῶν.	Therefore thou shalt take the firstfruit of the produce of the winepress and of the threshing-floor and of oxen and sheep, and shalt give them as the firstfruits to the prophets, for they are your high priests.
πρῶτος δ’ ἦν ἐν τοῖς προγράφουσι Λέπιδος, καὶ πρῶτος ἐν τοῖς προγραφομένοις ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ Λεπίδου Παῦλος, καὶ δεύτερος ἦν τῶν προγραφόντων Ἀντώνιος καὶ δεύτερος τῶν προγραφομένων ὁ θεῖος ὁ Ἀντωνίου Λεύκιος, οἵδε μέν, ὅτι πρῶτοι πολεμίους αὐτοὺς ἐψηφίσαντο.	Lepidus was the first to begin the work of proscription, and his brother Paulus was the first on the list of the proscribed. Antony came next, and the second name on the list was that of his uncle, Lucius Caesar. These two men had been the first to vote Lepidus and Antony public enemies.
δύο ἐπωμίδες συνέχουσαι ἔσονται αὐτῷ ἑτέρα τὴν ἑτέραν, ἐπὶ τοῖς δυσὶ μέρεσιν ἐξηρτισμέναι·	There will be two shoulder pieces joined together for it, the one with the other fastened at its two corners.
καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα, καὶ ἤγαγον τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡμέραν εὐφροσύνης μεγάλην.	And the people celebrated greatly and observed that day as a day of great celebration.
ξένια καὶ δῶρα ἀποτυφλοῖ ὀφθαλμοὺς σοφῶν, καὶ ὡς φιμὸς ἐν στόματι ἀποτρέπει ἐλεγμούς.	Hospitality and gifts blind the eyes of the wise and turn him away from discipline like a muzzle in the mouth.
πολλὴ γὰρ ἄν τις εὐδαιμονία εἴη περὶ τοὺς νέους εἰ εἷς μὲν μόνος αὐτοὺς διαφθείρει, οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι ὠφελοῦσιν.	for it would be a great state of blessedness in the case of the youth if one alone corrupts them, and the others do them good.
καὶ Θάμυριν μὲν Ὀδρύσην τε καὶ Θρᾷκα ἐπὶ τούτῳ καλοῦσιν·	Thamyris is called an Odrysian and Thracian on these grounds.
δείσας ὁ Καῖσαρ περὶ τῷ Κικέρωνι ὑπέστρεφεν εἰς τοὐπίσω.	Caesar apprehending an attack on [Quintus] Cicero turned back.
ἵνα τί, Κύριε, ἀπωθεῖς τὴν προσευχήν μου, ἀποστρέφεις τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ;	Why, O Lord, do you reject my prayer? Why do you turn away your face from me?
ἀμφικτύονες εἰς Δῆλον δραχμὴν τῆς ἡμέρας ἑκάστης ἐκ Δήλου λαμβάνουσι.	amphictyons for delos get a drachma a day from delos.
εἶναι δὲ Σόλωνα, Θαλῆν, Πιττακόν, Βίαντα, Χίλωνα, Μύσωνα, Κλεόβουλον, Περίανδρον, Ἀνάχαρσιν, Ἀκουσίλαον, Ἐπιμενίδην, Λεώφαντον, Φερεκύδην, Ἀριστόδημον, Πυθαγόραν, Λᾶσον Χαρμαντίδου ἢ Σισυμβρίνου, ἢ ὡς Ἀριστόξενος Χαβρίνου, Ἑρμιονέα, Ἀναξαγόραν.	They are Solon, Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Chilon, Myson, Cleobulus, Periander, Anacharsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, Leophantus, Pherecydes, Aristodemus, Pythagoras, Lasos, son of Charmantides or Sisymbrinus, or, according to Aristoxenus, of Chabrinus, born at Hermione, Anaxagoras.
οὐκ ἀποκρίνεσθαι χρῆν μᾶλλον ἢ τοιαῦτα ἐρωτᾶν;	Why didn't you answer me instead of asking such a question?
καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ καὶ πλημμελήσῃ, καὶ ἀποδῷ τὸ ἅρπαγμα ὃ ἥρπασεν, ἢ τὸ ἀδίκημα ὃ ἠδίκησεν, ἢ τὴν παραθήκην ἥτις παρετέθη αὐτῷ, ἢ τὴν ἀπωλίαν ἣν εὗρεν,	And it will be the case whenever someone sins and commits a trespass that he will return his fraudulently acquired property that he seized, or his ill-gotten goods that he acquired unjustly, or the deposit that was deposited with him, or the lost item that he found,
ἦν δέ ποτε καὶ τὸ πάλαι μεγάλη ξύνοδος ἐς τὴν Δῆλον τῶν Ἰώνων τε καὶ περικτιόνων νησιωτῶν· ξύν τε γὰρ γυναιξὶ καὶ παισὶν ἐθεώρουν, ὥσπερ νῦν ἐς τὰ Ἐφέσια Ἴωνες, καὶ ἀγὼν ἐποιεῖτο αὐτόθι καὶ γυμνικὸς καὶ μουσικός, χορούς τε ἀνῆγον αἱ πόλεις.	Once upon a time, indeed, there was a great assemblage of the Ionians and the neighboring islanders at Delos, who used to come to the festival, as the Ionians now do to that of Ephesus, and athletic and poetical contests took place there, and the cities brought choirs of dancers.
ἦσαν δὲ οἱ τὸ μέγιστον ἐν τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ἔχοντες κράτος οἵ τε Τισαμενοῦ παῖδες Δαϊμένης καὶ Σπάρτων καὶ Τέλλις τε καὶ Λεοντομένης·	Those who held the greatest power among the Achaeans were the sons of Tisamenus, Daimenes, Sparton, Tellis and Leontomenes
οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες Σειὼν ἐν αἵμασιν καὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐν ἀδικίαις·	who are building Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with injustice.
καὶ ὅρκοι εἴ που ἄρα γένοιντο ξυναλλαγῆς, ἐν τῷ αὐτίκα πρὸς τὸ ἄπορον ἑκατέρῳ διδόμενοι ἴσχυον οὐκ ἐχόντων ἄλλοθεν δύναμιν·	Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on either side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as no other weapon was at hand
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ τελευτήσαντος τοῦ Ἄγιδος ὁ Λύσανδρος, ἤδη κατανεναυμαχηκὼς Ἀθηναίους καὶ μέγιστον ἐν Σπάρτῃ δυνάμενος, τὸν Ἀγησίλαον ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν προῆγεν, ὡς οὐ προσήκουσαν ὄντι νόθῳ τῷ Λεωτυχίδῃ.	Notwithstanding this, after the death of Agis, Lysander, who by this time had subdued the Athenians at sea and was a man of the greatest influence in Sparta, tried to advance Agesilaüs to the throne, on the plea that Leotychides was a bastard and had no claim upon it.
μετέχει γε μὴν τοῦτο ὃ νῦν λέγομεν τοῦ τρίτου ψυχῆς εἴδους, ὃ μεταξὺ φρενῶν ὀμφαλοῦ τε ἱδρῦσθαι λόγος, ᾧ δόξης μὲν λογισμοῦ τε καὶ νοῦ μέτεστιν τὸ μηδέν, αἰσθήσεως δὲ ἡδείας καὶ ἀλγεινῆς μετὰ ἐπιθυμιῶν.	Certainly that creature which we are now describing partakes of the third kind of soul, which is seated, as we affirm, between the midriff and the navel, and which shares not at all in opinion and reasoning and mind but in sensation, pleasant and painful, together with desires.
Προεφήτευσεν δὲ καὶ τούτοις ἕβδομος ἀπὸ Ἀδὰμ Ἐνώχ, λέγων, Ἰδού, ἦλθεν κύριος ἐν ἁγίαις μυριάσιν αὐτοῦ,	Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints,
ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν ἔργου καὶ τοὺς Ἐπιγόνους ὑπὸ Ἑλλήνων καλουμένους ἀνέθεσαν οἱ Ἀργεῖοι·	From spoils of the same action, it seems to me, the Argives set up statues of those whom the Greeks call the Epigoni.
ἄκουε νῦν, φησί, περὶ τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἐπιγείου καὶ κενοῦ καὶ δύναμιν μὴ ἔχοντος, ἀλλὰ ὄντος μωροῦ.	Listen, now, said he, concerning the spirit which is earthly, and empty, and has no power, but is foolish..
ἢ τοῦτο μὲν οὔ, αὐτοῦ δὲ τρεφόμενοι σοῦ ζῶντος βέλτιον θρέψονται καὶ παιδεύσονται μὴ συνόντος σοῦ αὐτοῖς;	Or perhaps you will not do that, but if they are brought up here while you are living, will they be better brought up and educated if you are not with them than if you were dead?
καὶ ἔκραξαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, λέγοντες, Ἕως πότε, ὁ δεσπότης, ὁ ἅγιος καὶ ἀληθινός, οὐ κρίνεις καὶ ἐκδικεῖς τὸ αἷμα ἡμῶν ἐκ τῶν κατοικούντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς;	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
Οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐπαγωγὰ καὶ ὁρῶντες δεινά, οὐ μόνον οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀντεφιλοσόφησαν ⸂⸆⸃ τῷ τυράννῳ, καὶ διὰ τῆς εὐλογιστίας τὴν τυραννίδα αὐτοῦ κατέλυσαν.⸆	But after hearing the incentives and seeing the dreadful instruments, not only were they not afraid, but they also held their opposing perspective against the tyrant; and by means of their prudence, they overcame his tyranny.
καὶ αὖθις αὖ τὰ ἀνιαρὰ ὡσαύτως οὕτως οὐ καθ’ ὅσον ἀνιαρά, κακά;	and again, are not painful things in just the same sense bad—in so far as they are painful?
ἡ μὲν δὴ τοσαῦτα εἶπεν, ὁ δὲ Μάρκιος οὐκ εἴα πατρίδα καλεῖν τὴν ἐκβαλοῦσαν ἀλλὰ τὴν ὑποδεδεγμένην·	After she had thus spoken Marcius replied that the country which had cast him out was not his, but rather the land which had given him shelter.
Ἡ μὲν οὖν τῆς ζωῆς ἐστιν αὕτη· πρῶτον ἀγαπησεις τὸν θεὸν τὸν ποιήσαντά σε,	The way of life, then, is this: First, you shall love God who made you; second, love your neighbor as yourself,
παρὰ δὲ τὸ Αἰάκειον Φώκου τάφος χῶμά ἐστι περιεχόμενον κύκλῳ κρηπῖδι, ἐπίκειται δέ οἱ λίθος τραχύς·	Beside the shrine of Aeacus is the grave of Phocus, a barrow surrounded by a basement, and on it lies a rough stone.
τοῦτον δ᾽ ἀπεκρίνατο τὸν τρόπον ἐκεῖνος, ὁρῶν τὸν ἐρόμενον ἀδύνατον ὑπολαμβάνοντα μὴ μέγαν ὄντα καὶ καλὸν ἢ πλούσιον ταύτης τυγχάνειν τῆς προσηγορίας, αὐτὸς δ᾽ ἴσως ᾤετο τὸν ζῶντα ἀλύπως καὶ καθαρῶς πρὸς τὸ δίκαιον ἤ τινος θεωρίας κοινωνοῦντα θείας, τοῦτον ὡς ἄνθρωπον εἰπεῖν μακάριον εἶναι.	but anaxagoras answered in that way because he saw that the man who put the question supposed it to be impossible to receive the appellation' happy' without being great and beautiful or rich, whereas he himself perhaps thought that the person who humanly speaking enjoys bliss is he that lives by the standard of justice without pain and in purity, or participates in some form of divine contemplation.
φιλίαν τε Ῥωμαίοις προφέροντες οὐκ ἐλεεῖτε ἀκρίτους ἐπὶ θανάτῳ καὶ δημεύσει προγραφομένους, ἀλλ’ ὑποκρίνεσθε πεύσεσθαι τῆς βουλῆς τῆς ταῦτα πασχούσης καὶ οὐδὲ ἀμύνειν ἑαυτῇ πω δυναμένης.	While professing friendship for the Romans you have no pity for those who have been sentenced to death and confiscation without trial. You pretend that you want to hear from the Senate, which is suffering from these very evils and is not yet able to defend itself.
εἶπεν γὰρ ὁ κύριος: Ἔρχομαι συναγαγεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, φυλὰς καὶ γλώσσας: τοῦτο δὲ λέγει τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς ἐπιφανείας αὐτοῦ, ὅτε ἐλθὼν λυτρώσεται ἡμᾶς, ἕκαστον κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ.	For the Lord said: I come to gather together all the nations, tribes, and languages. Now by this he means the day of his appearing. when he will come and ransom each of us according to his works.
λέγεται μὲν δὴ καὶ μανέντα δρᾶσαι ταῦτα Ἀθάμαντα, λέγεται δὲ καὶ ὡς ἐς τὴν Ἰνὼ καὶ τοὺς ἐξ αὐτῆς παῖδας χρήσαιτο ἀκρατεῖ τῷ θυμῷ τὸν συμβάντα Ὀρχομενίοις λιμὸν καὶ τὸν δοκοῦντα Φρίξου θάνατον αἰσθόμενος, οὗ τὸ θεῖον αἴτιον οὐ γενέσθαι, βουλεῦσαι δὲ ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν Ἰνὼ μητρυιὰν οὖσαν·	One account is that Athamas did this in a fit of madness another is that he vented on Ino and her children unbridled rage when he learned that the famine which befell the Orchomenians and the supposed death of Phrixus were not accidents from heaven, but that Ino, the step-mother, had intrigued for all these things.
αἳ δ’ ὥστ’ ἢ ἔλαφοι ἢ πόρτιες εἴαρος ὥρῃ ἅλλοντ’ ἂν λειμῶνα κορεσσάμεναι φρένα φορβῇ, ὣς αἳ ἐπισχόμεναι ἑανῶν πτύχας ἱμεροέντων ἤιξαν κοίλην κατ’ ἀμαξιτόν· ἀμφὶ δὲ χαῖται ὤμοις ἀίσσοντο κροκηίῳ ἄνθει ὁμοῖαι.	As hinds or heifers in spring time, when sated with pasture, bound about a meadow, so they, holding up the folds of their lovely garments, darted down the hollow path, and their hair like a crocus flower streamed about their shoulders.
οὐκοῦν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, τὸ λεγόμενον, ἀδελφὸς ἀνδρὶ παρείη· ὥστε καὶ σύ, εἴ τι ὅδε ἐλλείπει, ἐπάμυνε.	Then, said I, as the proverb has it, Let a brother help a man—and so, if Glaucon omits any word or deed, do you come to his aid.
καὶ ἔσται τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ καὶ ἑτοιμάσουσιν ὃ ἐὰν εἰσενέγκωσιν, καὶ ἔσται διπλοῦν ὃ ἐὰν συναγάγωσιν τὸ καθ᾽ ἡμέραν εἰς ἡμέραν.	And it will be that on the sixth day they will prepare whatever they may bring in, and it will be twice that which they would gather, which is gathered from day to day.”
μαθὼν δὲ Αὐγείας ὅτι κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Εὐρυσθέως τοῦτο ἐπιτετέλεσται, τὸν μισθὸν οὐκ ἀπεδίδου, προσέτι δ’ ἠρνεῖτο καὶ μισθὸν ὑποσχέσθαι δώσειν, καὶ κρίνεσθαι περὶ τούτου ἕτοιμος ἔλεγεν εἶναι.	When Augeas learned that this had been accomplished at the command of Eurystheus, he would not pay the reward nay more, he denied that he had promised to pay it, and on that point he professed himself ready to submit to arbitration.
ἀπὸ τούτου δὲ βασιλεύσαντος Ἀρκαδία τε ἀντὶ Πελασγίας ἡ χώρα καὶ ἀντὶ Πελασγῶν Ἀρκάδες ἐκλήθησαν οἱ ἄνθρωποι.	After this king the land was called Arcadia instead of Pelasgia and its inhabitants Arcadians instead of Pelasgians.
τὰ μὲν δὴ ἐς τοὺς βασιλεῖς πολυπραγμονήσαντί μοι κατὰ ταῦτα ἐγενεαλόγησαν οἱ Ἀρκάδες· κοινῇ δὲ Ἀρκάσιν ὑπῆρχεν ἐς μνήμην τὰ μὲν ἀρχαιότατα ὁ πρὸς Ἰλίῳ πόλεμος, δεύτερα δὲ ὁπόσα ἀμύνοντες Μεσσηνίοις Λακεδαιμονίων ἐναντία ἐμαχέσαντο· μέτεστι δὲ καὶ πρὸς Μήδους σφίσιν ἔργου τοῦ ἐν Πλαταιαῖς.	I spent much care upon the history of the Arcadian kings, and the genealogy as given above was told me by the Arcadians themselves. Of their memorable achievements the oldest is the Trojan war; then comes the help they gave the Messenians in their struggle against Lacedaemon, and they also took part in the action at Plataea against the Persians.
καὶ διότι γράψαντος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἄλλα ποιήματα τήν τε τοῦ Ξέρξου διάβασιν καὶ προοίμιον εἰς Ἀπόλλωνα, ταῦθ’ ὔστερον κατέκαυσεν ἀδελφή τις αὐτοῦ ἢ θυγάτηρ, ὥς φησιν Ἱερώνυμος, τὸ μὲν προοίμιον ἄκουσα, τὰ δὲ Περσικὰ βουληθεῖσα διὰ τὸ ἀτελείωτα εἶναι.	He also says that he wrote other poems, in particular the invasion of Xerxes and a hymn to Apollo, which a sister of his (or, according to Hieronymus, his daughter) afterwards burnt. The hymn she destroyed unintentionally, but the poem on the Persian war deliberately, because it was unfinished.
πέμπτος Χρυσίππου μαθητής, βιβλία μὲν ὀλίγα γεγραφώς, μαθητὰς δὲ πλείστους καταλελοιπώς·	the fifth a pupil of Chrysippus, who left few writings but many disciples
ὦ μακάρι᾽ Αὐτόμενες ὥς σε μακαρίζομεν, παῖδας ἐφύτευσας ὅτι χειροτεχνικωτάτους·	you have three sons, the most industrious in the world;
οἱ μὲν οὖν τὰ μεγέθη γεννῶσιν ἐκ τοιαύτης ὕλης, ἕτεροι δὲ ἐκ τῆς στιγμῆς [ ἡ δὲ στιγμὴ αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ εἶναι οὐχ ἓν ἀλλ᾽ οἷον τὸ ἕν ] καὶ ἄλλης ὕλης οἵας τὸ πλῆθος, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ πλήθους·	these thinkers, then, generate geometrical magnitudes from this sort of material principle, but others generate them from the point ( they regard the point not as a unity but as similar to unity ) and another material principle which is not plurality but is similar to it;
περὶ δὲ πάξαις Ἄλτιν μὲν ὅγ’ ἐν καθαρῷ διέκρινε, τὸ δὲ κύκλῳ πέδον ἔθηκε δόρπου λύσιν, τιμάσαις πόρον Ἀλφεοῦ μετὰ δώδεκ’ ἀνάκτων θεῶν.	He enclosed the Altis all around and marked it off in the open, and he made the encircling area a resting-place for feasting, honoring the stream of the Alpheus along with the twelve ruling gods.
ὅτι εὐδόκησαν οἱ δοῦλοί σου τοὺς λίθους αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν χοῦν αὐτῆς οἰκτειρήσουσιν·	because your servants were well pleased with the stones of it, and they will have pity on the dust of it.
ὅστις γὰρ ἐβουλήθη βίᾳ ἀφαιρεθεὶς ἐνόχους καταστῆσαι τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ ἐπιτηδείους τοῖς βιαίοις μᾶλλον ἢ κατὰ τοὺς νόμους εἰς τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἐξαιρεθεὶς δίκην λαβεῖν παρὰ τῶν ἀγόντων αὐτόν, οὐδενὶ χαλεπὸν γνῶναι ὅτι εὖ εἰδὼς ἑαυτὸν ὄντα δοῦλον ἔδεισεν ἐγγυητὰς καταστήσας περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι.	For when a man has chosen, on being carried off by force, to make his own associates liable to action for assault rather than to be vindicated as a freeman by legal process and to get damages from those who were arresting him, nobody can have difficulty in perceiving that he was so conscious of his being a slave that he was afraid to provide guarantors and to face a trial concerning his civil status.
Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σεινὰ λέγων	And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
καίτοι πῶς ἂν εἴη τούτων δεινότερα μηχανήματα, εἰ ὑμῖν μὲν ἅπαξ τουτουσὶ πείσασι κατείργασται ἃ βούλεσθε, ἐμοὶ δ’ ἅπαξ ἀποφυγόντι;	Could any thing more unfair be devised? You and your associates have only to convince this court once, and your object is gained
Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν Νῶε καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε, καὶ πληρώσατε τὴν γῆν καὶ κατακυριεύσατε αὐτῆς.	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Increase and multiply and fill the earth and exercise dominion over it.
τούτου καθήμενόν ἐστιν Ἀθηνᾶς ἄγαλμα, ἐπίγραμμα ἔχον ὡς Καλλίας μὲν ἀναθείη, ποιήσειε δὲ Ἔνδοιος.	Made by him is a statue of Athena seated, with an inscription that Callias dedicated the image, but Endoeus made it.
καὶ συνήγαγεν Δαυεὶδ πάντα τὸν λαὸν καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Ῥαββάθ, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτήν.	So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah and made war on it and captured it.
Καὶ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ἐν βασιλείᾳ Ἀρθασεσθὰ βασιλέως Περσῶν ἀνέβη Ἔσρας υἱὸς Σαραίου υἱοῦ Ζαρείου υἱοῦ Ἑλκειὰ	Now after these matters, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, there went up Ezra, son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
ᾌσω δὴ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ᾆσμα τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ μου τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου. ἀμπελὼν ἐγενήθη τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ἐν κέρατι ἐν τόπῳ πίονι.	I will sing now to the loved one a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. A vineyard ⌊came into the possession of the⌋ loved one, at a corner in a fertile place.
οὐχ ὁ δοξάζων ἐπὶ τὶ φέρει τὴν δόξαν; ἢ οἷόν τε αὖ δοξάζειν μέν, δοξάζειν δὲ μηδέν; ἀδύνατον.	Does not he who opines bring his opinion to bear upon something or shall we reverse ourselves and say that it is possible to opine, yet opine nothing?
ἀλλ’ εἰ πάλιν γ’, ἔφην, φέροιτο, κάτω τ’ ἂν οἴοιτο φέρεσθαι καὶ ἀληθῆ οἴοιτο;	And if he were borne back, I said, he would both think himself to be moving downward and would think truly.
ἢ οὐ τοῦτο πολυχορδότατον, καὶ αὐτὰ τὰ παναρμόνια αὐλοῦ τυγχάνει ὄντα μίμημα;	Or is not the flute the most many-stringed of instruments and do not the pan-harmonics themselves imitate it?
εἶναι δὲ τὴν Στύγα Ἡσίοδος μὲν ἐν Θεογονίᾳ πεποίηκεν Ἡσιόδου γὰρ δὴ ἔπη τὴν Θεογονίαν εἰσὶν οἳ νομίζουσι , πεποιημένα οὖν ἐστιν ἐνταῦθα Ὠκεανοῦ θυγατέρα τὴν Στύγα, γυναῖκα δὲ αὐτὴν εἶναι Πάλλαντος. ἐοικότα δὲ πεποιηκέναι τούτοις καὶ Λίνον φασίν· ἐμοὶ δὲ ἐπιλεγομένῳ παντάπασιν ἐφαίνετο ταῦτά γε εἶναι κίβδηλα.	Hesiod in the Theogony —for there are some who assign this hexameter poem to Hesiod—speaks of Styx as the daughter of Ocean and the wife of Pallas. Men say that Linus too gives a like account in his verses, though when I read these they struck me as altogether spurious.
προσῳκείου δὲ ἑαυτὸν Ἀντώνιος Ἡρακλεῖ κατὰ γένος καὶ Διονύσῳ κατὰ τὸν τοῦ βίου ζῆλον, ὥσπερ εἴρηται, Διόνυσος νέος προσαγορευόμενος.	Now, Antony associated himself with Heracles in lineage, and with Dionysus in the mode of life which he adopted, as I have said, and he was called the New Dionysus.
καὶ παρὰ τῶν Λευειτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως τῆς πόλεως ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀφηγουμένων ἔσται ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὁρίων Ἰούδα καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὁρίων Βενιαμείν· τῶν ἀφηγουμένων ἔσται.	And some of the property of the city from the Levites will be in the midst of the princes’ properties between the borders of Judah and the borders of Benjamin; it will be the princes.’
Ἐνδύσασθε οὖν, ὡς ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ θεοῦ, ἅγιοι καὶ ἠγαπημένοι, σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ, χρηστότητα, ταπεινοφροσύνην, πρᾳότητα, μακροθυμίαν·	Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
ἐκ πυρὸς τὰ πάντα συνεστάναι καὶ εἰς τοῦτο ἀναλύεσθαι·	All things are composed of fire, and into fire they are again resolved
Τότε συνεκάλεσεν Ἰησοῦς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ῥουβὴν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Γὰδ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσή,	Then Joshua called together the descendants of Reuben and the descendants of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh,
⸂⸆⸃ ὥστε ἅμα τῷ παύσασθαι τὸν τύραννον συμβουλεύοντα αὐτοῖς μιεροφαγῆσαι, ⸆ πάντες διὰ μιᾶς φωνῆς ὁμοῦ, ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς ψυχῆς, εἶπον	so that at the moment the tyrant stopped advising them to eat unclean food, all of them with one voice, together as from the same soul, said as follows:
πάντα τὸν χρόνον οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τῶν κακῶν προσδέχονται κακά, οἱ δὲ ἀγαθοὶ ἡσυχάσουσιν διὰ παντός.	All the time the eyes of the evil welcome evil things, but the good will always be quiet.
ὅστις γὰρ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον περὶ πλείονος τῆς πρὸς ὑμᾶς πίστεως ἡγεῖται καὶ μήθ’ ὅρκου μήτ’ αἰσχύνης μήτε δικαίου πλείω λόγον ἢ τοῦ λαμβάνειν ποιεῖται, οὗτος ἀποδώσεται τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸν τὴν Μουνιχίαν, ἂν ἔχῃ τὸν ὠνησόμενον, οὗτος ἐξαγγελεῖ τοῖς πολεμίοις σύνθημα φήνας καθ’ ὑμῶν, οὗτος προδώσει τὴν πεζὴν καὶ ναυτικὴν δύναμιν.	For if anyone values silver and gold more highly than his loyalty to you and has no more regard for an oath or for honor and right than he has for making money, then that man, in so far as he is able, will sell Munichia if he has a buyer; he will signal to the enemy and reveal your secrets, he will betray your army and your fleet.
Σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις; Κατὰ σεαυτὸν ἔχε ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ. Μακάριος ὁ μὴ κρίνων ἑαυτὸν ἐν ᾧ δοκιμάζει.	Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
τῆς δὲ βασιλείας ἡ μὲν κατὰ νόμον, ἡ δὲ κατὰ γένος ἐστίν.	Monarchy is either regulated by law or hereditary.
Ἔνεγκόν μοι θήραν καὶ ποίησόν μοι ἐδέσματα, ἵνα φαγὼν εὐλογήσω σε ἐναντίον Κυρίου πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με.	Bring me game and make for me delicacies, so that upon eating it, I will bless you before the Lord before I die.
καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβδελύξατο τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ·	And the Lord was angered with anger over his people, and was abhorred with his inheritance.
καὶ Σεδεκίας οὐ μὴ σωθῇ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Χαλδαίων, ὅτι παραδόσει παραδοθήσεται εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ λαλήσει στόμα αὐτοῦ πρὸς στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὄψονται,	and Zedekiah will ⌊by no means⌋ be saved from the hand of the Chaldeans. Because ⌊he will surely be handed over⌋ into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth will speak to his mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes.
τοῦ μέντοι περὶ τὰς ὁμιλίας ὄγκου καὶ τοῦ πρὸς τὸν δῆμον ἀτενοῦς ἐφιλονείκει μηδὲν ὑφελεῖν μηδὲ χαλάσαι, καίτοι τῶν πραγμάτων αὐτῷ χάριτος ἐνδεῶν ὄντων, καὶ Πλάτωνος ἐπιτιμῶντος, ὡς εἰρήκαμεν, καὶ γράφοντος ὅτι ἡ αὐθάδεια ἐρημίᾳ σύνοικός ἐστιν.	Nevertheless, he made it a point not to remit or relax at all the gravity of his manners or his haughtiness in dealing with the people, although his situation called for a gracious demeanour, and although Plato, as I have said, wrote and warned him that self-will was a companion of solitude.
καὶ ὁ κληθεὶς Κορινθιακὸς πόλεμος ἐς πλέον ἀεὶ προῆλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς Λακεδαιμονίων ἀρξάμενος ἐς Βοιωτίαν ἐξόδου.	And what was called the Corinthian war, which continually became more serious, had its origin in the expedition of the Lacedaemonians into Boeotia.
διότι ἔστησεν ἡμέραν, ἐν ᾗ μέλλει κρίνειν τὴν οἰκουμένην ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, ἐν ἀνδρὶ ᾧ ὥρισεν, πίστιν παρασχὼν πᾶσιν, ἀναστήσας αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν.	"because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead."
ὅτι Μενέλαος σὺν Ὀδυσσεῖ καὶ Ταλθυβίῳ πρὸς Κινύραν εἰς Κύπρον ἐλθόντες συμμαχεῖν ἔπειθον·	Menelaus went with Ulysses and Talthybius to Cinyras in Cyprus and tried to persuade him to join the allies.
ἐπειγομένων δὲ τῶν Πελοποννησίων πρότερόν τε ξυμμεῖξαι, καὶ κατὰ μὲν τὸ δεξιὸν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὑπερσχόντες αὐτοὶ τῷ εὐωνύμῳ ἀποκλῇσαι τοῦ ἔξω αὐτοὺς ἔκπλου, εἰ δύναιντο, κατὰ δὲ τὸ μέσον ἐξῶσαι πρὸς τὴν γῆν οὐχ ἑκὰς οὖσαν, οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι γνόντες, ᾗ μὲν ἐβούλοντο ἀποφάρξασθαι αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐναντίοι, ἀντεπεξῆγον καὶ περιεγίγνοντο τῷ πλῷ,	The Peloponnesians hastened to engage first, and outflanking with their left the Athenian right sought to cut them off, if possible, from sailing out of the straits, and to drive their centre upon the shore, which was not far off. The Athenians perceiving their intention extended their own wing and outsailed them,
ὡς δὲ ἐς χεῖρας συνῄεσαν, ἐνταῦθα τοῖς Φωκεῦσιν ἐγίνετο ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τὰ ἐς τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ ἐς τὰ τέκνα δόξαντα, τήν τε σωτηρίαν οὐκ ἐν βεβαίῳ σφίσιν ἑώρων σαλεύουσαν καὶ τούτων ἕνεκα ἐς παντοῖα ἀφικνοῦντο τολμήματα· προσγενομένου δὲ καὶ τοῦ ἐκ θεῶν εὐμενοῦς νίκην τῶν τότε ἀνείλοντο ἐπιφανεστάτην.	When the battle joined, the Phocians had before their eyes what they had resolved to do to their women and children, and seeing that their own salvation trembled in the balance, they dared the most desperate deeds, and, with the favour of heaven, achieved the most famous victory of that time.
συνέπραττε δ’ αὐτῷ καὶ Θρασύβουλος ὁ Στειριεὺς ἅμα παρὼν καὶ κεκραγώς·	He had a helper, too, in Thrasybulus of Steiris, who went along with him and did the shouting
Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Ἀπόδοτε τοίνυν τὰ Καίσαρος Καίσαρι, καὶ τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ τῷ θεῷ.	And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
ἡ στάσις ὅρος διπλοῦς κατὰ ἀμφισβήτησιν· οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλοι ταῖς γενομέναις ἐξ ἀρχῆς διαθήκαις διισχυρίζονται, οἱ δέ, λέγοντες.	They further allege that Polyarchus, their grandfather and Cleonymus's father, instructed the latter, if anything should happen to him, to leave his property to them.
καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἁγίους τὸ διανόημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐοδωθήσεται τὸ ψεῦδος ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ὑψωθὴσεται, καὶ δόλῳ ἀφανιεῖ πολλούς, καὶ ἐπὶ ἀπωλείας ἀνδρῶν στήσεται καὶ ποιήσει συναγωγὴν χειρὸς καὶ ἀποδώσεται.	And his thoughts are against the holy ones, and he will succeed with deception in his hands, and his heart will be lifted up, and through deception he will get rid of many. And he will stand for the destruction of men, and he will act against the assembly of his dominion. But he will be stripped.
καὶ συνάψει τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ Γαιθβὼρ καὶ ἐπὶ Σαλεὶμ κατὰ θάλασσαν καὶ Βαιθσάμυς· καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ διέξοδος τῶν ὁρίων ὁ Ἰορδάνης.	and the borders will reach beside Tabor and Salim by the sea and Beth-shemesh; and the outlet of their border will be the Jordan.
πάνσμικρον δή τι, ἔφην ἐγώ, ὦ Ἀδείμαντε, λείπεται τῶν κατ’ ἀξίαν ὁμιλούντων φιλοσοφίᾳ, ἤ που ὑπὸ φυγῆς καταληφθὲν γενναῖον καὶ εὖ τεθραμμένον ἦθος, ἀπορίᾳ τῶν διαφθερούντων κατὰ φύσιν μεῖναν ἐπ’ αὐτῇ, ἢ ἐν σμικρᾷ πόλει ὅταν μεγάλη ψυχὴ φυῇ καὶ ἀτιμάσασα τὰ τῆς πόλεως ὑπερίδῃ·	There is a very small remnant, then, Adeimantus, I said, of those who consort worthily with philosophy, some well-born and well-bred nature, it may be, held in check by exile, and so in the absence of corrupters remaining true to philosophy, as its quality bids, or it may happen that a great soul born in a little town scorns and disregards its parochial affairs
ἔτι δὲ συλῶντας μὲν τὰ τῶν θεῶν, ἀποκτείνοντας δὲ τοὺς βελτίστους τῶν πολιτῶν, ἀπιστοῦντας δὲ τοῖς οἰκειοτάτοις, οὐδὲν δὲ ῥᾳθυμότερον ζῶντας τῶν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ συνειλημμένων, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν ἔξω ζηλουμένους, αὐτοὺς δὲ παρ’ αὑτοῖς μᾶλλον τῶν ἄλλων λυπουμένους·	further, he saw them despoiling the temples of the gods, putting to death the best of their fellow-citizens, distrusting those nearest to them, living lives no more free from care than do men who in prison await their death; he saw that, although they are envied for their external blessings, yet in their own hearts they are more miserable than all other men—
Ὁρᾶτε μή τις κακὸν ἀντὶ κακοῦ τινὶ ἀποδῷ· ἀλλὰ πάντοτε τὸ ἀγαθὸν διώκετε καὶ εἰς ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰς πάντας.	See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.
τὸ γὰρ παρ’ ὃ οἴεται βέλτιστον εἶναι πράττειν δι’ ἐπιθυμίαν ἀκρατεύεσθαι ἐστίν.	But yet the uncontrolled man does not do what he wishes, for being uncontrolled means acting against what one thinks to be best owing to desire
Καὶ εἶπεν Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον Ἐλεισαῖε Ἰδοὺ ἐφείσατο ὁ κύριός μου τοῦ Ναιμὰν τοῦ Σύρου τούτου, τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἃ ἐνήνοχεν· ζῇ Κύριος ὅτι εἰ μὴ δραμοῦμαι ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ λήμψομαι παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ τι.	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, said, “Look, my master spared Naaman, this Aramean, by not taking from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, surely I will run after him and take something from him.”
ἐκεῖθεν ἀπάραντες παρενέβαλον εἰς τὸ πέραν Ἀρνὼν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, τὸ ἐξέχον ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων τῶν Ἀμορραίων· ἔστιν γὰρ Ἀρνὼν ὅρια Μωὰβ ἀνὰ μέσον Μωὰβ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ Ἀμορραίου.	From there, after setting out, they pitched camp on the other side of the Arnon in the desert wilderness that extends from the territory of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the boundary limit of Moab between Moab and between the Amorites.
οὐ γὰρ ἐκεῖθεν οὕτως ὀνομαζόμενος ἧκεν, ἀλλ’ εἰς Ἀλεξάνδρειαν κομισθεὶς τὸ παρ’ Αἰγυπτίοις ὄνομα τοῦ Πλούτωνος ἐκτήσατο τὸν Σάραπιν.	for he had not this name when he came from thence, but after he was removed to Alexandria, he acquired the name of Serapis, which is the Egyptian for Pluto.
ἐφ’ ὁπόσον γὰρ ἂν κατίσχῃ ἑκάτερον, ἐπὶ τοσοῦτο ν ἅμα νοήματι τὴν φορὰν σχήσει, ἕως ἀντικόψῃ ἢ ἔξωθεν ἢ ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου βάρους πρὸς τὴν τοῦ πλήξαντος δύναμιν.	As long as either motion obtains, it must continue, quick as the speed of thought, provided there is no obstruction, whether due to external collision or to the atoms’ own weight counteracting the force of the blow.
οὐ γάρ πω τοίους ἴδον ἀνέρας οὐδὲ ἴδωμαι οἷον Πειρίθοόν τε Δρύαντά τε ποιμένα λαῶν Καινέα τ’ Ἐξάδιόν τε καὶ ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον Θησέα τ’ Αἰγείδην ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν.	—I have never yet seen such men, and I am never likely to seeAs were Peirithous, Dryas, shepherd of the folk,Caeneus, Exadius, god-like Polyphemus,And Theseus, son of Aegeus, like to the immortals.
ἐν διχομηνίδεσσιν δὲ ἑσπέραις ἐρατὸν λύοι κεν χαλινὸν ὑφ’ ἥρωϊ παρθενίας. ὣς φάτο Κρονίδαις ἐννέποισα θεά·	On the evening of the full moon let her loosen the lovely bridle of her virginity for that hero.” So the goddess spoke, addressing the sons of Cronus, and they nodded assent with their immortal brows.
εἰ μὲν γάρ τις ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἀρχὴ ἰσχυροτέρα , ὑφ’ ἧς αὐτῷ προσετάττετο παρὰ τὸ δίκαιον ἀνθρώπους ἀπολλύναι, ἴσως ἂν εἰκότως αὐτῷ συγγνώμην εἴχετε·	For had there been some stronger authority in the city, whose orders were given him to destroy people in defiance of justice, you might perhaps have some reason for pardoning him
διὰ γὰρ ταύτης ἔγερσις καὶ ἀνάπαυσις ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἡμῶν γίνεται·	for thereby rising and rest cometh unto our souls.
καὶ Βαναίας καὶ Ὀζειὴλ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν διὰ παντὸς ἐναντίον τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ θεοῦ	Benaiah and Uzziel, the priests, were with the trumpets through everything before the ark of the covenant of God.
καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν πάσαις φυλαῖς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Ἀβὲλ καὶ εἰς Βαιθμαχά, καὶ πάντες ἐν Χαρρεὶ καὶ ἐξεκκλησιάσθησαν· καὶ ἦλθεν κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ.	And he passed through among all the tribes of Israel to Abel and to Beth-maacah. And everyone from the Bichrites also assembled and went following him.
οἰκείαν οὖν χρὴ τὴν τιμωρίαν ἡγησαμένους, αὐτῷ τούτῳ τὰ τούτου ἀσεβήματα ἀναθέντας, ἰδίαν μὲν τὴν συμφοράν, καθαρὰν δὲ τὴν πόλιν καταστῆσαι.	And so you must hold the avenging of the dead a personal duty; you must visit the defendant with retribution for the sin which was his alone; you must see that none but he suffers, and that the stain of guilt is removed from the city.
καὶ εἰς θυσίαν σωτηρίου δαμάλεις δύο, κριοὺς πέντε, τράγους πέντε, ἀμνάδας ἐνιαυσίας πέντε· τοῦτο τὸ δῶρον Ἐλεισαμὰ υἱοῦ Ἐμιούδ.	and for a sacrifice of well-being, two heifers, five rams, five he-goats, five one-year-old ewe lambs; this was the offering of Elishama  son of Ammihud.
καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν οἱ δεύτεροι, Ζαχαρίας καὶ Ὀζειὴλ καὶ Σεμειραμὼθ καὶ Ἰειὴλ καὶ Ἐλιωὴλ καὶ Ἐλιαβὰ καὶ Βαναιὰ καὶ Μαασσαιὰ καὶ Ἰματταθιὰ καὶ Ἐλειφενὰ καὶ Μακελλειὰ καὶ Ἀβαεδὸμ καὶ Ἰεειὴλ καὶ Ὀζείας, οἱ πυλωροί.	And with them were their brothers, the second, Zechariah and Uzziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Elioel and Eliab and Benaiah and Maaseiah and Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jehiel and Uzziah, the porters.
ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἂν οὐ κραίνοιμ᾽ ὑπόσχεσιν πάρος, ἀστοῖς δὲ πᾶσι τῶνδε κοινώσας πέρι.	for myself, i will pledge no promise before i have communicated these events to all the citizens.
καὶ πηγή τε αὐτόθι ἐστὶν Ὀλυμπιὰς καλουμένη, τὸν ἕτερον τῶν ἐν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπορρέουσα, καὶ πλησίον τῆς πηγῆς πῦρ ἄνεισι.	Here there is a spring called Olympias which, during every other year, does not flow, and near the spring rises up fire.
πρὸς τὸν εἰπόντα, κακῶς ὁ δεῖνά σε λέγει, καλῶς γάρ, ἔφη, λέγειν οὐκ ἔμαθε.	What, said he, is my own good enough to live in but not to die in? When he was told that So-and-so spoke ill of him, he replied, True, for he has never learnt to speak well.
οὗτος Ἀννίβαν τὸν Καρχηδόνιον, φθόνῳ καὶ ταῖς πολιτικαῖς δυσμενείαις μηδενὸς οἴκοθεν ἐπιρρέοντος, ὥσπερ χείμαρρον ἐξέχεε καὶ κατανήλωσε περὶ τὴν Ἰταλίαν.	It was this Genius which dissipated Hannibal the Carthaginian, when he broke in upon Italy like a torrent, and the people could give no assistance, being torn in pieces by intestine jars.
τὸν γὰρ δὴ ἕτερον λόγον, ὡς τὴν θεὸν πέδαις ἐτιμωρεῖτο ὁ Τυνδάρεως, γενέσθαι ταῖς θυγατράσιν ἐξ Ἀφροδίτης ἡγούμενος τὰ ὀνείδη, τοῦτον οὐδὲ ἀρχὴν προσίεμαι·	The other account, that Tyndareus punished the goddess with fetters because he thought that from Aphrodite had come the shame of his daughters, I will not admit for a moment.
Λαμπρὰ καὶ ἀμάραντός ἐστιν ἡ σοφία, καὶ εὐχερῶς θεωρεῖται ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγαπώντων αὐτήν·	Wisdom is brilliant and unfading, and she is observed easily by those who love her;
Λάβε τὴν ἁγίαν ῥομφαίαν δῶρον παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ, δι᾽ ἧς θραύσεις τοὺς ὑπεναντίους.	“Take this holy sword, a gift from God, by which you will smite your enemies.”
Τὴν δὲ φαντασίαν εἶναι τύπωσιν ἐν ψυχῇ, τοῦ ὀνόματος οἰκείως μετενηνεγμένου ἀπὸ τῶν τύπων τῶν ἐν τῷ κηρῷ ὑπὸ τοῦ δακτυλίου γινομένων.	the name having been appropriately borrowed from the imprint made by the seal upon the wax.
Ἀντωνίου δὲ ἡ μήτηρ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ καὶ παῖς ἔτι μειράκιον οἵ τε ἄλλοι οἰκεῖοι καὶ φίλοι δι’ ὅλης τῆς νυκτὸς ἐς τὰς τῶν δυνατῶν οἰκίας διέθεον ἱκετεύοντες καὶ μεθ’ ἡμέραν ἐς τὸ βουλευτήριον ἰόντας ἠνώχλουν, ῥιπτούμενοί τε πρὸ ποδῶν σὺν οἰμωγῇ καὶ ὀλολυγαῖς καὶ μελαίνῃ στολῇ παρὰ θύραις ἐκβοῶντες.	In the morning they put themselves in the way of those going to the senate-house, fell at their feet with wailing and lamentation and in mourning garments, crying out alongside the doors.
οἱ μὲν δὴ καὶ τὸν Ἄννωνα στρατηγὸν ὄντα σφῶν συναρπάσαντες, ἔτι τῶν λεγομένων ἀκροώμενον, καὶ τοὺς αὐτομόλους παρέδοσαν·	Accordingly they seized Hanno, although he was their general and was listening to the conversation, and they delivered up the deserters.
ἤκουσα δὲ ἐν Θάσῳ τὸν αὐτὸν σφᾶς Ἡρακλέα ὃν καὶ Τύριοι σέβεσθαι, ὕστερον δὲ ἤδη τελοῦντας ἐς Ἕλληνας νομίσαι καὶ Ἡρακλεῖ τῷ Ἀμφιτρύωνος νέμειν τιμάς.	They told me in Thasos that they used to worship the same Heracles as the Tyrians, but that afterwards, when they were included among the Greeks, they adopted the worship of Heracles the son of Amphitryon.
λέγουσι γὰρ ἐν ἀρτίῳ μέτρῳ % ἕκτῳ καὶ πεντηκοστῷ γεγονέναι Τυφῶνα·	for they say he was produced in an even proportion of numbers, to wit, in that of fifty-six.
τὸ γὰρ οἰκείως ἀεὶ λεγόμενον πρὸς ἦθός τι βλέποντες λέγομεν.	For we call a thing apt and proper when we consider the nature of it.
ἐπειδὴ προσάπτουσιν αὐτὰ κἂν εἰ μὴ πάντες εἰς τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν, ἀλλ᾽ οὖν οἱ λόγου ἄξιοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων πάντες.	since that they are connected with happiness is asserted, if not by everybody, at all events by all of mankind who are worthy of consideration.
ἀλλ’ ἐὰν μὲν ἐμποιῇ ἡ αὐτῶν πονηρία τῶν σιτίων τῷ σώματι σώματος μοχθηρίαν, φήσομεν αὐτὸ δι’ ἐκεῖνα ὑπὸ τῆς αὑτοῦ κακίας νόσου οὔσης ἀπολωλέναι·	but when the badness of the foods themselves engenders in the body the defect of body, then we shall say that it is destroyed owing to these foods, but by its own vice, which is disease.
ἀλλ’ ἐξέλεγχε, κρῖνε δ’ εὐθεῖαν δίκην.	Well then, question him, and make a straight judgment.
ἐπειδὰν τὸ καθάρσιον περιενεχθῇ καὶ ὁ κῆρυξ τὰς πατρίους εὐχὰς εὔξηται, προχειροτονεῖν κελεύει τοὺς προέδρους περὶ ἱερῶν τῶν πατρίων καὶ κήρυξι καὶ πρεσβείαις καὶ ὁσίων, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπερωτᾷ ὁ κῆρυξ·	after the purifying sacrifice has been carried round and the herald has offered the traditional prayers, the presiding officers are commanded to declare to be next in order the discussion of matters pertaining to the national religion, the reception of heralds and ambassadors, and the discussion of secular matters.
ἐπιδραμόντες δὲ ἐκ τοῦ στρατεύματος αἰχμάλωτόν τε τὴν γυναῖκα αἱροῦσι καὶ διδάσκονται παρ’ αὐτῆς οἱ Ἀχαιοὶ ὅτι τὸ ὀλίγον τὸ ἐκ τῆς πίδακος ὕδωρ, ὁπότε ἐφ’ ἑκάστης λάβοιεν τῆς νυκτός, διεμετροῦντο αὐτό, καὶ ἄλλο ἦν τοῖς ἔνδον ἀλέξημα οὐδὲν ἐς δίψαν.	Some of the besiegers ran up and took the woman prisoner, who informed the Achaeans that the scanty water from the spring, that was fetched each night, was rationed among the besieged, who had nothing else to quench their thirst.
Ἀπογράφονται δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πέμπτης καὶ εἰκάδος τοῦ Παχὼν ἕως τῆς τετάρτης τοῦ Ἐπιφί, ἐπὶ ἡμέρας τεσσαράκοντα· συνίστανται δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν ἀπώλειαν ἀπὸ πέμπτης τοῦ Ἐπιφὶ ἕως ἑβδόμης, ἡμέραις τρισίν.	And they registered them from ⌊the twenty-fifth day of the month⌋ of Pachon until the fourth day of Epeiph, for forty days, and they fixed their destruction from the fifth of Epeiph until the seventh, three days,
τὸ δ᾽ αὐτὸ κἂν εἴ τις ταῦτα πλείω τίθησιν, οἷον Ἐμπεδοκλῆς τέτταρά φησιν εἶναι σώματα τὴν ὕλην. καὶ γὰρ τούτῳ τὰ μὲν ταὐτὰ τὰ δ᾽ ἴδια συμβαίνειν ἀνάγκη. γιγνόμενά τε γὰρ ἐξ ἀλλήλων ὁρῶμεν ὡς οὐκ ἀεὶ διαμένοντος πυρὸς καὶ γῆς τοῦ αὐτοῦ σώματος [ εἴρηται δὲ ἐν τοῖς περὶ φύσεως περὶ αὐτῶν ], καὶ περὶ τῆς τῶν κινουμένων αἰτίας, πότερον ἓν ἢ δύο θετέον, οὔτ᾽ ὀρθῶς οὔτε εὐλόγως οἰητέον εἰρῆσθαι παντελῶς.	the same will apply too if anyone posits more than one, as e. g. empedocles says that matter consists of four bodies; objections must occur in his case also, some the same as before, and some peculiar to him. first, we can see things being generated from each other in a way which shows that fire and earth do not persist as the same corporeal entity. ( this subject has been treated in my works on natural science. ) again with regard to the cause of motion in things,
καὶ λέγεται γὰρ τουτογί, ὡς οἱ δικασταὶ ψευδομένων τῶν μαρτύρων μόλις τὸ πρᾶγμ᾽ ἔγνωσαν ἀναμασώμενοι. ἀνά τό με πείθεις.	is it not said, that the dicasts, when deceived by lying witnesses, have need to ruminate well in order to arrive at the truth?
ἀπὸ δὲ ἐθνῶν τῶν κατειλεγμένων ἑκάστῃ πόλει ἀνὰ μέρος ἐς Ἀμφικτύονας καὶ ἐν χρόνου περιόδῳ συντελεῖν ἔστιν.	but each city of the nations mentioned has the privilege of sending members in turn after the lapse of periodic intervals.
εὐφρανθήτω Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτόν, καὶ υἱοὶ Σειὼν ἀγαλλιάσθωσαν ἐπὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν·	Let Israel be gladdened in the one who made him, and let the children of Zion rejoice exceedingly in their King.
καὶ προσκαθεζόμενοι τὸν Ὀρχομενὸν πάντες ἐπολιόρκουν καὶ προσβολὰς ἐποιοῦντο, βουλόμενοι ἄλλως τε προσγενέσθαι σφίσι καὶ ὅμηροι ἐκ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας ἦσαν αὐτόθι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων κείμενοι.	They now all sat down and besieged Orchomenos, and made assaults upon it; one of their reasons for desiring to gain this place being that hostages from Arcadia had been lodged there by the Lacedaemonians.
ὅθεν δ’, οἶμαι, τάχιστ’ ἂν ὑμᾶς μαθεῖν περὶ ὧν ἀμφισβητοῦμεν, ἐντεῦθεν ἄρξομαι διηγεῖσθαι.	and I shall begin the recital of them at the point from which, in my opinion, you will be able to learn most quickly the matters at issue.
ὁ δὲ Ἆγις ἀπεκρίνατο μὴ θαυμάζειν τὸν Λεωνίδαν, εἰ τεθραμμένος ἐν ξένῃ καὶ πεπαιδοποιημένος ἐκ γάμων σατραπικῶν ἀγνοεῖ τὸν Λυκοῦργον, ὅτι τὸ μὲν ὀφείλειν καὶ δανείζειν ἅμα τῷ νομίσματι συνεξέβαλεν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως,	But Agis replied that he was not astonished to find Leonidas, who had been reared in foreign lands and had children by an oriental marriage, ignorant that Lycurgus had banished from the state debts and loans along with coined money,
οὐχὶ οὗ ἂν μέρος μηδὲν ἀπῇ ὅλον ἂν εἴη;	Is not a whole that of which no part is wanting?
ὥστε τὰ μὲν πρότερον γεγενημένα κοινὰ θεῖναι δίκαιόν ἐστιν·	and so it is fair to charge the mistakes of the past to our common weakness.
καὶ ἦσαν παῖδες αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ μέχρι οὗ βασιλεῦσαι Πέρσας, εἰς ἀναπλήρωσιν τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ κυρίου ἐν στόματι Ἰερεμίου	And they were servants to him and to his sons until the reign of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah,
μνήσθητε ὅσα ἐποίησεν μετὰ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ὅσα ἐπείρασεν τὸν Ἰσαάκ, καὶ ὅσα ἐγένετο τῷ Ἰακὼβ ἐν Μεσοποταμίᾳ τῆς Συρίας ποιμαίνοντι τὰ πρόβατα Λαβὰν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.	Remember all that he did with Abraham and how greatly he tested Isaac and all that happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, while tending the sheep of Laban the brother of his mother.
οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευεῖται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Σαδδοὺκ οἵτινες ἐφυλάξαντο τὰς φυλακὰς τῶν ἁγίων μου ἐν τῷ πλανᾶσθαι οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, οὗτοι προσάξουσιν πρὸς μὲ τοῦ λειτουργεῖν μοι, καὶ στήσονται πρὸ προσώπου μου τοῦ προσφέρειν μοι θυσίαν, στέαρ καὶ αἷμα, λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός.	The Levite priests, the sons of Zadok who ⌊kept guard over⌋ my sanctuary when the house of Israel wandered astray from me, they will approach me, to serve me as priests, and they shall stand before my face to offer me sacrifice, fat and blood,” says the Lord God.
διὰ τοῦτο τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῶν ξηρά ἐστι καὶ δύναμιν μὴ ἔχοντα, καὶ τὰ ῥήματα αὐτῶν μόνα ζῶσι, τὰ δὲ ἔργα αὐτῶν νεκρά ἐστιν. οἱ τοιοῦτοι οὔτε ζῶσιν οὔτε τεθνήκασιν. ὅμοιοι οὖν εἰσὶ τοῖς διψύχοις: καὶ γὰρ οἱ δίψυχοι οὔτε χλωροί εἰσιν οὔτε ξηροί: οὔτε γὰρ ζῶσιν οὔτε τεθνήκασιν.	For this cause their foundations are dry and have no power, and only their words are alive but their deeds are dead. Such are neither alive nor dead. Therefore they are like the double-minded, for the double-minded are neither green nor dry, for they are neither alive nor dead.
Οὗτοι στήσονται εὐλογεῖν τὸν λαὸν ἐν ὄρει Γαριζείν, διαβάντες τὸν Ἰορδάνην· Συμεών, Λευεί, Ἰουδά, Ἰσσαχάρ, Ἰωσὴφ καὶ Βενιαμείν.	“These shall stand to bless the people in Mount Gerizim when you pass over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
ἐπὶ γὰρ τῇ ἀπὸ πνεύμονος φορῇ μούνῃ χαλεπωτά τῃ ἐούσῃ οὐκ ἀπογιγνώσκουσι ἑωυτῶν οἱ ἄνθρωποι, κἢν ἐν τῷ ἐσχάτῳ ἔωσι.	in the discharge from the lungs alone, which is particularly dangerous, the patients do not despair of themselves, even although near the last.
ἔλαβεν δὲ Ἠσαὺ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας καὶ πάντα τὰ σώματα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ τὰ κτήνη, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐκτήσατο καὶ ὅσα περιεποιήσατο ἐν γῇ Χανάαν· καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκ γῆς Χανάαν ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰακὼβ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ.	Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the people of his house and all the things that he possessed and the herds and everything, as many as he had acquired and as many as he procured in the land of Canaan, and he went out of the land of Canaan from the presence of Jacob, his brother.
εἰ δὲ μωκώμενος, μάταιος ἐν τοῖς οὐκ ἐπιδεχομένοις.	If he speaks only in mockery, his words are foolishness, for those who hear believe him not.
Σωκράτης. χρησταὶ δὲ οὐχ αἱ τῶν φρονίμων, πονηραὶ δὲ αἱ τῶν ἀφρόνων;	Soc. And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the unwise are evil?
καὶ τῶν ἁλόντων καὶ κρατησάντων δίχα φθογγὰς ἀκούειν ἔστι συμφορᾶς διπλῆς.	and so, of captives and of conquerors, partwise the voices are to hear, of fortune diverse.
Ἕλληνες δὲ ἄλλα τε λέγουσι καὶ ἄνδρας ἑπτὰ γενέσθαι σοφούς.	Among the sayings of the Greeks is one that there were seven wise men.
ἔνιοι μὲν γὰρ νέοι ὄντες προφερεῖς καὶ πρεσβύτεροι φαίνονται, ἕτεροι δέ, πολὺν ἀριθμὸν χρόνου γεγονότες, παντάπασι νέοι.	for some men, young in years, seem mature and older than they are;
πότερον, ἔφην, ὥσπερ προσώπου τὰ μόρια μόριά ἐστιν, στόμα τε καὶ ῥὶς καὶ ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ ὦτα, ἢ ὥσπερ τὰ τοῦ χρυσοῦ μόρια οὐδὲν διαφέρει τὰ ἕτερα τῶν ἑτέρων, ἀλλήλων καὶ τοῦ ὅλου, ἀλλ’ ἢ μεγέθει καὶ σμικρότητι;	Do you mean parts, I asked, in the sense of the parts of a face, as mouth, nose, eyes, and ears or, as in the parts of gold, is there no difference among the pieces, either between the parts or between a part and the whole, except in greatness and smallness?
πότερον οὖν ἐξ ἁπάντων ὁμοίως γεννᾷς, ἢ προθυμῇ ὅτι μάλιστα ἐκ τῶν ἀρίστων;	Do you then breed from all indiscriminately, or are you careful to breed from the best?
οὐ μὰ γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνα Διῒ φίλον, ᾧ τε σὺ Κάλχαν εὐχόμενος Δαναοῖσι θεοπροπίας ἀναφαίνεις, οὔ τις ἐμεῦ ζῶντος καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο σοὶ κοίλῃς παρὰ νηυσί βαρείας χεῖρας ἐποίσει συμπάντων Δαναῶν, οὐ δ᾽ ἢν Ἀγαμέμνονα εἴπῃς, ὃς νῦν πολλὸν ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν εὔχεται εἶναι.	for by Apollo, dear to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas, pray when you reveal oracles to the Danaans, no one, while I live and have sight on the earth, shall lay heavy hands on you beside the hollow ships, no one of the whole host of the Danaans, not even if you name Agamemnon, who now claims to be far the best of the Achaeans.
ἐπειδὰν δὲ ἀνὴρ ἔρχηται παρὰ τὸν Τροφώνιον, κλίμακα αὐτῷ κομίζουσι στενὴν καὶ ἐλαφράν.	They have made no way of descent to the bottom, but when a man comes to Trophonius, they bring him a narrow, light ladder.
τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τὸ νῦν ἐγένετο Ἰώνων ἐποικούντων, ἐγένετο δὲ ἐπ’ αἰτίᾳ τοιᾷδε.	Its present name was given it while the Ionians were still dwelling there, and the reason for the name was as follows.
καὶ παρῆλθεν Ἰεφθάε πρὸς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν παρατάξασθαι πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.	And Jephthah came against the descendants of Ammon to array for battle against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
ἔστιν ἐλάττωσις ἕνεκεν δόξης, καὶ ἔστιν ὃς ἀπὸ ταπεινώσεως ἦρεν κεφαλήν.	There is loss for the sake of glory, and there is one who will raise his head from humiliation.
διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, ὃν ἀφώρισεν ἐξ Ἀβραάμ Οὐ νῦν αἰσχυνθήσεται Ἰακώβ, οὐδὲ νῦν τὸ πρόσωπον μεταβαλεῖ·	Because of this, this is what the Lord says about the house of Jacob, which he set apart from Abraham: “Not now ⌊will Jacob be ashamed⌋, and not now ⌊will his face change⌋.
σπείραιμι ἄρα καὶ ἄλλοι φάγοισαν, ἄριζος δὲ γενοίμην ἐπὶ γῆς.	then let me sow and others eat, and let me be uprooted from the land.
ἐρράγησαν τὰ σχοινία σου, ὅτι οὐκ ἐνίσχυσαν· ὁ ἱστός σου ἔκλινεν, οὐ χαλάσει τὰ ἱστία, οὐκ ἀρεῖ σημεῖον, ἕως οὗ παραδοθῇ εἰς προνομήν· τοίνυν πολλοὶ χωλοὶ προνομὴν ποιήσουσιν.	Your cords have broken because they did not grow strong; your mast bent over; it will not release the sails; it will not raise a signal until it is handed over for plunder. Accordingly, many lame will make plunder.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ λανθάνει πως ὁ Περσεὺς Ὀροάνδην τινὰ Κρῆτα λέμβον ἔχοντα συμπείσας μετὰ χρημάτων ἀναλαβεῖν αὐτόν,	However, Perseus somehow succeeded in persuading a certain Cretan named Oroandes, the owner of a small skiff to take him on board with his treasures.
οὐδεμιᾷ γὰρ ἐπιστήμῃ ἐπιμελὲς περὶ αὐτοῦ οὔτε πρακτικῇ οὔτε ποιητικῇ οὔτε θεωρητικῇ. οὔτε γὰρ ὁ ποιῶν οἰκίαν ποιεῖ ὅσα συμβαίνει ἅμα τῇ οἰκίᾳ γιγνομένῃ [ ἄπειρα γάρ ἐστιν· τοῖς μὲν γὰρ ἡδεῖαν τοῖς δὲ βλαβερὰν τοῖς δ᾽ ὠφέλιμον οὐθὲν εἶναι κωλύει τὴν ποιηθεῖσαν, καὶ ἑτέραν ὡς εἰπεῖν πάντων τῶν ὄντων· ὧν οὐθενός ἐστιν ἡ οἰκοδομικὴ ποιητική ], τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ τρόπον οὐδ᾽ ὁ γεωμέτρης θεωρεῖ τὰ οὕτω συμβεβηκότα τοῖς σχήμασιν, οὐδ᾽ εἰ ἕτερόν ἐστι τρίγωνον καὶ τρίγωνον δύο ὀρθὰς ἔχον.	the " what," quality, quantity, place, time, and any other similar meanings; and further besides all these the potential and actual: since the term " being " has various senses, it must first be said of what " is " accidentally, that there can be no speculation about it. this is shown by the fact that no science, whether practical, productive or speculative, concerns itself with it. the man who produces a house does not produce all the attributes which are accidental to the house in
ἡ Μήδων ἄδικον παύσασ’ ὕβριν, ἥδε Σόλωνα τόνδε τεκνοῖ Σαλαμὶς θεσμοθέτην ἱερόν.	At Salamis, which crushed the Persian might, Solon the legislator first saw light.
βραχύ μοι στόμα πάντ’ ἀναγήσασθ’, ὅσων Ἀργεῖον ἔχει τέμενος μοῖραν ἐσλῶν·	My mouth is too small to tell the whole story of all the noble things in which the precinct of Argos has a share.
Θησεὺς δὲ παρέλαβε τὴν Ἀθηναίων δυναστείαν, καὶ τοὺς μὲν Πάλλαντος παῖδας πεντήκοντα τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέκτεινεν·	But Theseus succeeded to the sovereignty of Athens, and killed the sons of Pallas, fifty in number
λυσιτελήσει γὰρ αὐτοῖς, εἰ μέλλουσιν, οἷς ἂν ἀποδῶσι τεκμηρίοις χρώμενοι, ὧν ἂν ἀποστερῶσι μὴ δώσειν δίκην.	For it will be to their advantage, if they can use their repayment of some as presumptive proof so that they will not be punished for their stealing the rest.
Ὁ μὲν οὖν παραλαβὼν αὐτὸν ἤγαγεν πρὸς τὸν χιλίαρχον, καί φησιν, Ὁ δέσμιος Παῦλος προσκαλεσάμενός με ἠρώτησεν τοῦτον τὸν νεανίαν ἀγαγεῖν πρός σε, ἔχοντά τι λαλῆσαί σοι.	So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."
πότερα γὰρ αὐτοῦ ζῶντος ἢ τεθνηκότος φάτις πρὸς ἄλλων ναυτίλων ἐκλῄζετο;	whether, then, of him, as a live or dead man was the report by other sailors bruited?
τῇ δὲ προτέρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ ξυνέβη τῆς μάχης ταύτης καὶ τοὺς Ἐπιδαυρίους πανδημεὶ ἐσβαλεῖν ἐς τὴν Ἀργείαν ὡς ἐρῆμον οὖσαν καὶ τοὺς ὑπολοίπους φύλακας τῶν Ἀργείων ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν διαφθεῖραι πολλούς.	The day before this battle, the Epidaurians with all their forces invaded the deserted Argive territory, and cut off many of the guards left there in the absence of the Argive army.
ὅπερ, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, χρὴ καὶ πρῶτον καὶ μάλιστα μέμφεσθαι, ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐάν τις μὴ καλῶς ψεύδηται.	With that, I said, which one ought first and chiefly to blame, especially if the lie is not a pretty one.
οὐδενὸς δὲ τοῦτο προσδοκήσαντος, οὐδὲ ῥᾳδίας οὔσης τῆς παρασκευῆς, ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ δεόμενος καὶ παραιτούμενος ἔπεισεν ἐπιτρέψαι τὴν παρεσκευασμένην ἐν τῷ περὶ Τοῦσκλον ἀγρῷ τοῦ νεκροῦ κηδείαν γενέσθαι, πολὺν δ’ οὐδ’ αὐτὸς προσεβίω χρόνον, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἡλικίᾳ καὶ δόξῃ μικρὸν ἀπελείφθη, καὶ τῷ χρόνῳ τῆς τελευτῆς, φιλαδελφότατος γενόμενος.	But no one had expected this, and preparations for it were not easy, and so his brother, by prayers and supplications, succeeded in persuading them to suffer the burial to take place on the estate at Tusculum, where preparations for it had been made. Nor did he himself long survive Lucullus, but, as in age and reputation he came a little behind him, so did he also in the time of his death, having been a most affectionate brother.
πρὸς τοίνυν τὰ τοιαῦτα, ὦ φίλε, πτεροῦν χρὴ παιδία ὄντα εὐθύς, ἵν’, ἄν τι δέῃ, πετόμενοι ἀποφεύγωσιν.	To provide against such chances, then, we must wing the children from the start so that if need arises they may fly away and escape.
δῶρον γὰρ ἀγαθόν ἐστιν ἐλεημοσύνη πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον τοῦ ὑψίστου.	Indeed, almsgiving is a good gift for all who practice it in the sight of the Most High.
Ὃς ἐὰν οὖν λύσῃ μίαν τῶν ἐντολῶν τούτων τῶν ἐλαχίστων, καὶ διδάξῃ οὕτως τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ἐλάχιστος κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν· ὃς δ' ἂν ποιήσῃ καὶ διδάξῃ, οὗτος μέγας κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν.	"Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
ἐπειδὴ δ’ οὔπω περιτετυχήκαμεν ἀλλήλοις, περὶ μὲν τῶν ἄλλων, ἤν ποτ’ εἰς ταὐτὸν ἔλθωμεν, τόθ’ ἡμῖν ἐξέσται διὰ πλειόνων ποιήσασθαι τὴν συνουσίαν, ἃ δ’ ἐν τῷ παρόντι δυναίμην ἂν εὐεργετῆσαί σε, ταῦτα δ’ ᾠήθην χρῆναι σοὶ μὲν ἐπιστεῖλαι, πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἄλλους ὡς οἷόν τε μάλιστ’ ἀποκρύψασθαι.	But since we have not yet met one another, we shall be able, if we ever do come together, to discuss the other topics at greater length; concerning those suggestions, however, by which at the present time I might be of service to you, I have thought I should advise you by letter, though concealing my views, to the best of my ability, from everyone else.
τὸν μὲν μουσικὸν δήπου φρόνιμον, τὸν δὲ ἄμουσον ἄφρονα.	The musician, I presume, is the intelligent and the unmusical the unintelligent.
κἀγὼ γὰρ ηὔχουν Μητρόβιος ὁ γραμματεὺς σὺν ἀνδρὶ θείῳ καὶ φιλοξενωτάτῳ καὶ πάντ’ ἀρίστῳ τῶν Πανελλήνων πρὸ τοῦ Κίμωνι λιπαρὸν γῆρας εὐωχούμενος αἰῶνα πάντα συνδιατρίψειν.	Yes, I too hoped, Metrobius, I, the public scribe, Along with man divine, the rarest host that lives, In every way the best of all Hellenic men, With Cimon, feasting out in joy a sleek old age, To while away the remnant of my life.
ἰσόρροπον μὲν ὦν ἰητήριον, ὡς μεγάλῳ πάθεϊ μέγα βοήθημα, φλεβοτομίη, ἢν μή τις ἐς ἁμαρτωλὴν ἴῃ τοῦ πλήθεος δυστέκμαρτον δὲ τὸ μέτρον.	The equivalent remedy, then, as being the great assistance in a a great disease, is venesection, provided there be no mistake as to quantity
πολλάκις δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἀγροῖς ἐπιπορευόμενοι τοὺς ῥωμαλεωτάτους καὶ κρατίστους αὐτῶν ἀνῄρουν.	Oftentimes, too, they actually traversed the fields where Helots were working and slew the sturdiest and best of them.
ὅτι νῦν καιρὸς ἀντιλαβέσθαι τῆς κληρονομίας σου καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸ ἐπιτήδευμά μου εἰς θραῦμα ἐχθρῶν οἳ ἐπανέστησαν ἡμῖν.	Because now is the time to lay hold of your inheritance and to complete my mission for the destruction of the enemies who rose up against us.”
δωδεκάτῃ δὲ ὕστερον μετὰ Κᾶρα τὸν Φορωνέως γενεᾷ λέγουσιν οἱ Μεγαρεῖς Λέλεγα ἀφικόμενον ἐξ Αἰγύπτου βασιλεῦσαι καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους κληθῆναι Λέλεγας ἐπὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς αὐτοῦ·	In the twelfth generation after Car the son of Phoroneus the Megarians say that Lelex arrived from Egypt and became king, and that in his reign the tribe Leleges received its name.
ἀντέλεγον δ’ αὐτοῖς ἐπιχώριοί τινες ὑπ’ ἐκείνων πεπολεμημένοι.	This petition was opposed by some of the country people who had been incited to war by them.
ετ ηυιυσμοδι μορς μαχιμε ηονορατυρ.	a death which men crown with the highest of praise.
ὧν Οὐεντίδιος συνεὶς ἐς τὸν Ἀντώνιον ἀπῄει.	Ventidius took the hint and proceeded to join Antony.
ὃς οὐκ ἐπειράθη ὀλίγα οἶδεν,	He who has no experience knows little,
Τημένῳ τῶν Δωριέων Ἄργος ἐφέντων ἔχειν, Κρεσφόντης γῆν σφᾶς ᾔτει τὴν Μεσσηνίαν ἅτε καὶ αὐτὸς Ἀριστοδήμου πρεσβύτερος.	When the Dorians assigned Argos to Temenus, Cresphontes asked them for the land of Messenia, in that he was older than Aristodemus.
ἅπερ Ἀντίγονός φησιν ὁ Καρύστιος ἐν τῷ Περὶ Ζήνωνος νεωστὶ ἐκδοθέντα εἴ τις ἤθελε διαναγνῶναι, μισθὸν ἐτέλει τοῖς κεκτημένοις.	As Antigonus of Carystus says in his Life of Zeno, when the writings were first edited with critical marks, their possessors charged a certain fee to anyone who wished to consult them.
ἡ μὲν ξύμβασις αὕτη ἐγένετο, οἱ δὲ πράξαντες πρὸς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους μάλιστα τῶν Μυτιληναίων περιδεεῖς ὄντες, ὡς ἡ στρατιὰ ἐσῆλθεν, οὐκ ἠνέσχοντο, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοὺς βωμοὺς ὅμως καθίζουσιν· Πάχης δ’ ἀναστήσας αὐτοὺς ὥστε μὴ ἀδικῆσαι, κατατίθεται ἐς Τένεδον μέχρι οὗ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τι δόξῃ.	Such were the terms of the capitulation; in spite of which the chief authors of the negotiation with Lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when the army entered, that they went and seated themselves by the altars, from which they were raised up by Paches under promise that he would do them no wrong, and lodged by him in Tenedos, until he should learn the pleasure of the Athenians concerning them .
οὐ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Λύσανδρος ὁμοίως ἔργον ἐποιήσαντ’ ἐκεῖνον ἀποκτεῖναι καὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν καταλῦσαι δύναμιν, οὐδεμίαν ἡγούμενοι πίστιν ἕξειν παρὰ τῆς πόλεως, εἰ τὰ τείχη καταβάλοιεν, εἰ μὴ καὶ τὸν ἀναστῆσαι δυνάμενον ἀπολέσαιεν;	Did not the Lacedaemonians and Lysander exert themselves as much to cause his death as to bring about the downfall of your dominion, in the belief that they could not be sure of the city's loyalty if they demolished her walls unless they should also destroy the man who could rebuild them?
ὡς οὖν διαλύσαντες τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἦγον εἷς τὸ δεσμωτήριον τοὺς ἄνδρας, οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι, περιπλεκομένων τῶν φίλων αὐτοῖς καὶ οἰκείων, ὀδυρόμενοι καὶ καταθρηνοῦντες ἐβάδιζον, τὸ δὲ Φωκίωνος πρόσωπον οἷον ὅτε στρατηγῶν ἀπ’ ἐκκλησίας προὐπέμπετο βλέποντες, ἐθαύμαζον τὴν ἀπάθειαν καὶ μεγαλοψυχίαν τοῦ ἀνδρός.	When, accordingly, the assembly had been dissolved and the men were being led to the prison, the rest of them, as their friends and relatives clung about them, walked along lamenting and shedding tears; but the countenance of Phocion was the same as it used to be when he was escorted from the assembly as general, and when men saw it, they were amazed at the man’s calmness and at his grandeur of spirit.
κατισχύσατε οὖν σφόδρα φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου Μωυσῆ, ἵνα μὴ ἐκκλίνητε εἰς δεξιὰν ἢ εὐώνυμα·	Therefore, be very strong to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses so that you might turn neither to the right nor the left,
τῇδε καὶ ἡ παροχέτευσις ἀπὸ τῶν σιναρῶν. ἢν μὲν ὦν ἄνευ φανερῆς προφάσιος ἀπόπληκτοι γίγνωνται, ὧδε χρὴ συλλογί ζεσθαι ἀμφὶ τῆς ἀφαιρέσιος ·	In a word, the abstraction is to be made from the healthy parts, for there the blood flows more freely, and thither the revulsion is made from the parts affected.
Οὐδὲ φάγῃ τὸν ἀετὸν οὐδὲ τὸν ὀξύπτερον οὐδὲ τὸν ἰκτῖνα οὐδὲ τὸν κόρακα·	Neither shalt thou eat the eagle nor the hawk nor the kite nor the crow.
ὃς ἅμα τῷ τὴν σκυτάλην ἐλθεῖν εὐτυχίαν τοσαύτην καὶ δύναμιν παροῦσαν καὶ τηλικαύτας ἐλπίδας ὑφηγουμένας ἀφεὶς καὶ προέμενος εὐθὺς ἀπέπλευσεν ἀτελευτήτῳ ἐπὶ ἔργῳ, πολὺν ἑαυτοῦ πόθον τοῖς συμμάχοις ἀπολιπών, καὶ μάλιστα δὴ τὸν Ἐρασιστράτου τοῦ Φαίακος ἐλέγξας λόγον, εἰπόντος ὡς εἰσὶ δημοσίᾳ μὲν Λακεδαιμόνιοι βελτίονες, ἰδίᾳ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι.	No sooner had the dispatch-roll come to him than he renounced and abandoned the great good fortune and power already in his grasp, and the great hopes which beckoned him on, and at once sailed off with task all unfulfilled, leaving behind a great yearning for him among his allies, and giving the strongest confutation to the saying of Erasistratus the son of Phaeax, who declared that the Lacedaemonians were better men in public life, but the Athenians in private.
πολλοῦ δὲ δέομεν ἄνθρωποι τὴν σελήνην, γῆν οὖσαν ὀλυμπίαν, ἄψυχον ἡγεῖσθαι σῶμα καὶ ἄνουν καὶ ἄμοιρον ὧν θεοῖς ἀπάρχεσθαι προσήκει, νόμῳ τε τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀμοιβὰς τίνοντας καὶ κατὰ φύσιν σεβομένους τὸ κρεῖττον ἀρετῇ καὶ δυνάμει καὶ τιμιώτερον.	For both by law we yield her recompenses and thanksgivings, for that we receive of her and by nature we adore what we acknowledge to be of a more excellent virtue and a more honorable power and therefore we do not think that we offend in supposing the moon to be earth.
οὕτω μὲν τὸν Ἀννίβαν ἀποθανεῖν λέγουσιν. ἀπαγγελθέντων δὲ τούτων πρὸς τὴν σύγκλητον, οὐκ ὀλίγοις ἐπαχθὴς ἔδοξεν ὁ Τίτος καί περιττὸς ἄγαν καί ὠμός, ὥσπερ ὄρνιν ὑπὸ γήρως ἀπτῆνα καί κόλουρον ἀφειμένον ζῆν χειροήθη τὸν Ἀννίβαν ἀποκτείνας, οὐδενὸς ἐπείγοντος, ἀλλὰ διὰ δόξαν, ὡς ἐπώνυμος τοῦ θανάτου γένοιτο.	Such are the accounts of the death of Hannibal. When the story of it was brought to the senate, many of them thought the conduct of Titus odious, officious, and cruel; for he had killed Hannibal when he was like a bird permitted to live a tame and harmless life because too old to fly and without a tail, and there had been no necessity for his doing this, but he did it to win fame, that his name might be associated with the death of Hannibal.
οἱ γὰρ νῦν πιστεύσαντες ἢ μέλλοντες πιστεύειν μετάνοιαν ἁμαρτιῶν οὐκ ἔχουσιν, ἄφεσιν δὲ ἔχουσι τῶν προτέρων ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν.	For those who have already believed or shall believe in the future, have no repentance of sins, but have remission of their former sin.
ὡς τήνδε καὶ δὴ τὴν στρατηγὸν ἡμῶν χωροῦσαν ἐξ ἐκκλησίας ὁρῶμεν.	let us glance round sharply with our eye to beware of surprises, while we quickly resume our ordinary dress.
καίτοι καὶ τούτῳ προσῆκεν, εἰ μὴ πάππος ἦν μοι Κίρων, ὠθεῖν καὶ ἐκβάλλειν καὶ κωλύειν συνθάπτειν.	Yet if Ciron had not really been my grandfather, it was the duty of my opponent to repulse me and reject me and prevent me from taking part in the burial.
ληϊζόμενοι δὲ τὴν θάλασσαν ἐκ παλαιοῦ, τελευτῶντες οὐδὲ τῶν εἰσπλεόντων παρ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ χρωμένων ἀπείχοντο ξένων, ἀλλὰ Θετταλούς τινας ἐμπόρους περὶ τὸ Κτήσιον ὁρμισαμένους συλήσαντες εἷρξαν.	So they practised piracy on the high sea from of old, and finally did not withhold their hands even from those who put into their ports and had dealings with them, but robbed some Thessalian merchants who had cast anchor at Ctesium, and threw them into prison.
καὶ εἶπεν Δαυεὶδ πρὸς Ἰωναθάν Τίς ἀπαγγείλῃ μοι ἐὰν ἀποκριθῇ ὁ πατήρ σου σκληρῶς;	And David said to Jonathan, “Who should report to me if your father answers harshly?”
καὶ εἶπα Τί ἐστιν; καὶ εἶπεν Τοῦτο τὸ μέτρον τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον. καὶ εἶπεν Αὕτη ἡ ἀδικία αὐτῶν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ.	And I said, “What is it?” And he said, “This is the measurement, the one going out.” And he said, “This is their injustice in all the earth.”
διόπερ δοκεῖ τῆς σωτηρίας αἰτιώτατος γενέσθαι τῇ Ἑλλάδι καὶ μάλιστα τοὺς Ἀθηναίους προαγαγεῖν εἰς δόξαν, ὡς ἀνδρείᾳ μὲν τῶν πολεμίων, εὐγνωμοσύνῃ δὲ τῶν συμμάχων περιγενομένους.	Therefore he is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Hellas, and foremost in leading the Athenians up to the high repute of surpassing their foes in valor and their allies in magnanimity.
καίτοι κἀκεῖνος ἀριθμοὺς οἴεται καὶ ταῦτα εἶναι καὶ τὰς τούτων αἰτίας, ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν νοητοὺς αἰτίους τούτους δὲ αἰσθητούς.	it is true that he too supposes that numbers are both these magnitudes and their causes;
ὧδε μὲν τοῖς τὰ πιθανώτατα λέγουσι δοκεῖ μυριάδας ἑπτὰ ἀνδρῶν Ἰταλῶν συμπεσεῖν ἀλλήλοις ἐς μάχην· οἱ δ’ ὀλιγωτέρους ἑξακισμυρίων φασίν, οἱ δ’ ὑπερεπαίροντες τεσσαράκοντα μυριάδας γενέσθαι λέγουσι.	Some of the most trustworthy writers say that 70,000 Italian soldiers were engaged in this battle. Others give the smaller number, 60,00000. Still others, grossly exaggerating, say 400,000.
Ἐπιγνόντες δὲ ὅτι Ἰουδαῖός ἐστιν, φωνὴ ἐγένετο μία ἐκ πάντων ὡς ἐπὶ ὥρας δύο κραζόντων, Μεγάλη ἡ Ἄρτεμις Ἐφεσίων.	But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"
ἡμῖν γε μὲν δὴ πιστὰ θεσπίζειν δοκεῖς.	and yet to us at least the prophecies you utter seem true enough.
ὅν τινα τιμήσωσι Διὸς κοῦραι μεγάλοιο γεινόμενόν τε ἴδωσι διοτρεφέων βασιλήων, τῷ μὲν ἐπὶ γλώσσῃ γλυκερὴν χείουσιν ἐέρσην, τοῦ δ’ ἔπε’ ἐκ στόματος ῥεῖ μείλιχα·	whomever of heaven-nourished princes the daughters of great Zeus honor and behold at his birth, they pour sweet dew upon his tongue, and from his lips flow gracious words.
Ῥωμαίοις δὲ Θρᾴκη τε πᾶσά ἐστιν ὑποχείριος, καὶ Κελτῶν ὅσον μὲν ἀχρεῖον νομίζουσι διά τε ὑπερβάλλον ψῦχος καὶ γῆς φαυλότητα, ἑκουσίως παρῶπταί σφισι, τὰ δὲ ἀξιόκτητα ἔχουσι καὶ τούτων.	But the Romans have subdued all Thrace, and they also hold such Celtic territory as is worth possessing, but they have intentionally overlooked the parts that they consider useless through excessive cold or barrenness.
ὅτι πάντες οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν εἴδωλα, καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν οὐρανὸν ἐποίησεν.	For all the gods of the nations are idols, but our God made the heavens.
καὶ ὁ Τισσαφέρνης ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσπένδου, ὡς ἐπύθετο τὰς τῶν Πελοποννησίων ναῦς ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον πεπλευκυίας, ἀναζεύξας ἤλαυνεν ἐπὶ τῆς Ἰωνίας.	Meanwhile Tissaphernes, upon hearing that the Peloponnesian fleet had sailed from Miletus to the Hellespont, set off again back from Aspendus, and made all sail for Ionia.
τόδε μὲν δὴ τῇ Περυσίᾳ τέλος ἦν, δόξαν ἀρχαιότητος ἐχούσῃ καὶ ἀξιώσεως·	Such was the end of Perusia, a city renowned for its antiquity and importance.
καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἐκεῖθεν τὰ ὀστᾶ Σαοὺλ καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ Ἰωναθὰν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνήγαγεν τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν ἐξηλιασμένων.	And he brought the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there and gathered the bones of those who were hanging in the sun.
δοκέω γὰρ εἴ τινι βροτῶν ἀλκίμων ἐπικουρίαν καὶ τὶν ἔμμεναι νέων, ὦ Πανδίονος υἱὲ καὶ Κρεούσας.	for I think that you of all mortals have the aid of valiant young men at your disposal, son of Pandion and Creusa.
καὶ ἐπήλπισαν περὶ πλειόνων, εἰ τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦ πολέμου συνεκπονήσειεν αὑτοῖς.	They also gave him 100 minas of silver plate and a tent completely furnished, and told him that he might expect more if he would coöperate with them to the end of the war.
τὸ τέταρτον ἐν πυρὶ ἀνακαύσεις ἐν μέσῃ τῇ πόλει κατὰ τὴν πλήρωσιν τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῦ συγκλεισμοῦ, καὶ λήμψῃ τὸ τέταρτον καὶ κατακαύσεις αὐτὸ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον κατακόψεις ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον διασκορπίσεις τῷ πνεύματι, καὶ μάχαιραν ἐκκενώσω ὀπίσω αὐτῶν.	A fourth of it you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfillment of the days of the siege, and a fourth of it you shall take and burn it in its midst, and a fourth of it you shall cut in pieces with a sword around it, and a fourth of it shall scatter abroad to the wind; and I will unsheath a sword after them.
οὐ γὰρ οὖν, ἔφη. οὐκοῦν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, εἰκότως τό γε τοιοῦτον νοήσεως οὐκ ἂν παρακλητικὸν οὐδ’ ἐγερτικὸν εἴη. εἰκότως.	Then, said I, “it is to be expected that such a perception will not provoke or awaken reflection and thought.” “It is.” “But now, what about the bigness and the smallness of these objects?
ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἴδμεν, ὅ τοι περὶ μὲν πραπίδες, περὶ δ’ ἐστὶ νόημα, ἀλκτὴρ δ’ ἀθανάτοισιν ἀρῆς γένεο κρυεροῖο.	no, even of ourselves we know that your wisdom and understanding is exceeding, and that you became a defender of the deathless ones from chill doom.
" καὶ μὴν δύο χιτῶνας ἡ γαστὴρ ἔχει πάντως ἕνεκά του γεγονότας καὶ διήκουσιν οὗτοι μέχρι τοῦ στόματος, ὁ μὲν ἔνδον, οἷός ἐστι κατὰ τὴν γαστέρα, τοιοῦτος διαμένων, ὁ δ’ ἕτερος ἐπὶ τὸ σαρκωδέστερον ἐν τῷ στομάχῳ τρεπόμενος.	Now the fact is that the stomach possesses two coats, which certainly exist for some purpose
καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς Διέλετε τὸ παιδίον τὸ θηλάζον τὸ ζῶν εἰς δύο, καὶ δότε τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ ταύτῃ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ ταύτῃ.	And the king said, “Divide the infant who suckles and who lives into two. Give half of him to this woman and half of him to this other woman.”
διέβη δὲ καὶ ἐς Ἰταλίαν ὕστερον Ταραντίνοις βαρβάρων πόλεμον συνδιοίσων σφίσιν ὁμόρων·	Archidamus afterwards also crossed over into Italy to help the Tarentines to wage war against their foreign neighbors.
Δέομαί σου καὶ ἱκετεύω ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ θεοῦ σου ἵνα ἄξιος γένωμαι τῆς τούτου διακονίας καὶ ὑπηρεσίας, καὶ κληρωθῶ ἄξιος γενέσθαι τῶν ὀφθέντων μοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ.	I entreat and supplicate thee before thy God that I may become worthy of his ministry and service, and that it may fall to me to be worthy of the things that were shown unto me by his angels.
ἀποφυγόντος δὲ ἢ καταγνωσθέντος τέλος ἔχει καὶ διώρισται τούτων ὁπότερόν ἐστιν.	but after his acquittal or conviction the matter is decided, and it is settled whether they are the one or the other.
εἰ δ᾽ ὅτι λόγοι ἀριθμῶν τἀνταῦθα, οἷον ἡ συμφωνία, δῆλον ὅτι ἐστὶν ἕν γέ τι ὧν εἰσὶ λόγοι. εἰ δή τι τοῦτο, ἡ ὕλη, φανερὸν ὅτι καὶ αὐτοὶ οἱ ἀριθμοὶ λόγοι τινὲς ἔσονται ἑτέρου πρὸς ἕτερον.	and if it is because the things of our world are ratios of numbers ( e. g. a musical concord ), clearly there is some one class of things of which they are ratios. now if there is this something, i. e. their matter, clearly the numbers themselves will be ratios of one thing to another. i mean, e. g.,
Ὡς ἡδὺς πᾶς τρόπος θανάτου διὰ τὴν πάτριον ἡμῶν εὐσέβειαν· ἔφη τε πρὸς τὸν τύραννον	“How sweet is every manner of death for our ancestral faith!” He also said to the tyrant,
καὶ περιέτεμον τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἀπερίτμητα ὅσα εὗρεν ἐν ὁρίοις Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἰσχύι.	And they circumcised the uncircumcised young men, as many as were discovered in the borders of Israel, by force.
εἰ δέ τοι μηδὲν τούτων ἕξει εἰπεῖν, πῶς οὐκ ἐλεγχθήσεται φανερῶς ἐμὲ μὲν συκοφαντῶν, ὑμᾶς δ’ ἐξαπατῆσαι παρὰ τοὺς νόμους ζητῶν;	If, on the other hand, he cannot prove the existence of any such relationship, surely he will be clearly convicted of bringing a vexatious suit against me and of trying to deceive you in contravention of the laws.
καὶ ἰδὼν Φεινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεαζὰρ υἱὸς Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως ἐξανέστη ἐκ μέσου τῆς συναγωγῆς, καὶ λαβὼν σειρομάστην ἐν τῇ χειρὶ	And seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, the priest, rose up out of the midst of the congregation and took a barbed lance in his hand.
λέγε αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ταῦτα πάντα ἐστὶν ἀληθῆ καὶ οὐθὲν ἔξωθέν ἐστιν τῆς ἀληθείας, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἰσχυρὰ καὶ βέβαια καὶ τεθεμελιωμένα ἐστίν.	Tell them, that all these things are true, and that there is nothing beyond the truth, but that all things are strong and certain and well-founded.
πρεσβῦται φιλοψυχοῦσιν ἐπὶ δυσμαῖς τοῦ βίου.	Old men shrink from death in the sunset of life.
φύλασσε αὐτά, ἵνα καὶ τὰ πρότερον ἃ ἐλάλησας ψευδὴ ἐν ταῖς πραγματείαις σου, τούτων εὑρεθέντων ἀληθινῶν, κἀκεῖνα πιστὰ γένηται:	Keep them that your former lies in your business may themselves become trustworthy now that these have been found true.
εἰ δὲ τοῦτο μὴ λέγεται κακῶς, ἀλλ’ ἐχρῶντο Ῥωμαῖοι τότε τῷ ὀνόματι τῆς ταλασίας καθάπερ ἡμεῖς, ἑτέραν ἄν τις αἰτίαν εἰκάσειε πιθανωτέραν.	Now if this is right, and the Romans did at that time use the word talasia for spinning, as we do, then a more credible reason for the custom might be conjectured as follows.
εἱμαρμένη τε γὰρ προσαγορεύεται ὡς ἂν εἰρομένη τις·	For it is called εἱμαρμένη as being εἰρομένη, that is, dependent and linked
εὐδοκίμει δὲ μάλιστα ὁ ἅρπαξ, ἔκ τε πολλοῦ ταῖς ναυσὶ διὰ κουφότητα ἐμπίπτων καὶ ἐμπηγνύμενος, ὅτε μάλιστα ὑπὸ τῶν καλῳδίων ἐφέλκοιτο ὀπίσω·	The generals cheered their men, and all the machines were brought into requisition. The harpago achieved the greatest success. Thrown from a long distance upon the ships, as it could be by reason of its lightness, it clutched them, especially when the ropes pulled on it from behind.
ἴδον γὰρ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τῶν υἱῶν μου καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων, ἣν ἐπήγαγεν αὐτοῖς ὁ αἰώνιος.	For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters that the Eternal One brought upon them.
Καὶ ἀπολύσας τοὺς ὄχλους, ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος κατ' ἰδίαν προσεύξασθαι· ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης, μόνος ἦν ἐκεῖ.	And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there.
ἀκούσας οὖν μου ὁ Κριτίας ταῦτ’ εἰπόντος, Ἕρμαιον, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, γεγονὸς ἂν εἴη ἡ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἀσθένεια τῷ νεανίσκῳ, εἰ ἀναγκασθήσεται καὶ τὴν διάνοιαν διὰ τὴν κεφαλὴν βελτίων γενέσθαι.	Then Critias, when he heard me say this, remarked,—This affection of the head, Socrates, will turn out to be a stroke of luck for the young man, if he is to be compelled on account of his head to improve his understanding also.
μεσηγὺ δὲ ὑποκλύζειν μαλάχης ἑψήματι, καὶ ἐλαίῳ, καὶ μέλιτι. δριμὺ δὲ πᾶν ἀντερείσθωσαν σικύαι κατ’ ἰσχίου, ἢ ἤτρου. ἄρισται δὲ καὶ βδέλλαινέρθεν ἑλκύσαι αἷμα· καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖσι τρώμασι ἐπίπλασμα, αἱ ψίχες ξὺν ἀλθαίῃ· ἔπειτα ἐνίζειν ὕδατι ἀρτεμισίης , ἐλελισφάκου, κονύζης ἑψήματι · καὶ εὖτ’ ἂν προσωτέρω μὲν ἥκῃ χρόνου, μὴ κατὰ λόγον δὲ τὸ πάθος ἐνδιδῷ, δέος δὲ σπασμοῦ· μάλα γάρ τοι ἐπὶ τῷδε σπῶνται·	In the interval we are to open the bowels with a decoction of mallows, oil, and honey. But everything acrid . . . . . . Cupping-instruments are to be fixed to the ischiatic region, or the abdomen leeches also are very good for attracting blood from the inner parts, and to their bites a a cataplasm made of crumbs of bread with marsh-mallows.
Ταῦτα δὲ εἰπὼν καθῆκεν ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὀχήματος.	And having so said he came down from the chariot.
κ̣ληροῦται δ᾽ οὗτος, ἵνα μὴ ἀεὶ ὁ αὐτὸς ἐμπηγνύων κακουργῇ.	this attendant is chosen by lot, in order that the same person may not always affix the tickets and cheat.
Τελευτήσαντος δὲ Σελεύκου τοῦ βασιλέως, διαδέχεται τὴν ἀρχὴν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀντίοχος Ἐπιφανής, ἀνὴρ ὑπερήφανος, δεινός·	But when Seleucus, the king, ⌊passed away⌋, his son, Antiochus Epiphanes—an arrogant, terrible man—took up the rule,
οὗτος ἐρχομένου Σωκράτους ἐπὶ τὸ ἐργαστήριον καὶ διαλεγομένου τινά, ὧν ἐμνημόνευεν ὑποσημειώσεις ἐποιεῖτο·	When Socrates came to his workshop and began to converse, he used to make notes of all that he could remember.
τοῦτ’ ἔστιν ὃ ἐπιτιμᾷ, ἐπίφθονον πρᾶγμα καὶ οὐ δίκαιον ποιῶν·	It is for this that he blames him, a proceeding which is as spiteful as it is unjust
πᾶσά τε ἰδέα κατέστη τῆς φυγῆς καὶ τοῦ ὀλέθρου τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τῶν Ἀθηναίων, μόλις τε ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὸν Οἰνεῶνα τῆς Λοκρίδος, ὅθεν περ καὶ ὡρμήθησαν, οἱ περιγενόμενοι κατέφυγον.	Indeed the Athenian army fell victims to death in every form, and suffered all the vicissitudes of flight; the survivors escaped with difficulty to the sea and Oeneon in Locris, whence they had set out.
ἁπάντων μὲν οὖν ἐφρόντιζον τῶν πολιτῶν, μάλιστα δὲ τῶν νεωτέρων.	Now our forefathers exercised care over all the citizens, but most of all over the young.
Ῥωμαῖοι δὲ αὖθις ἄνδρα ἐκ τῆς βουλῆς καταπέμπουσιν ἐς τὴν Ἑλλάδα· ὄνομα μὲν τῷ ἀνδρὶ ἦν Γάλλος, ἀπέσταλτο δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ Ἀργείοις ὑπὲρ γῆς ἀμφισβητουμένης γενέσθαι δικαστής. οὗτος ὁ Γάλλος ἐς τὸ Ἑλληνικὸν πολλὰ μὲν εἶπε, πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἔπραξεν ὑπερήφανα, Λακεδαιμονίους δὲ καὶ Ἀργείους τὸ παράπαν ἔθετο ἐν χλευασίᾳ·	The Romans again despatched a senator to Greece. His name was Gallus, and his instructions were to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Argives in the case of a disputed piece of territory. This Gallus on many occasions behaved towards the Greek race with great arrogance, both in word and deed, while he made a complete mock of the Lacedaemonians and Argives.
καὶ δευτέρας τῆσδε πείρας ὁ Ἀννίβας ἐπὶ τῇ πόλει σφαλεὶς ἀπεχώρει.	Hannibal, having failed in his second attempt against the city, now withdrew.
εὐοφθάλμους μὲν καὶ περιγεγραμμένους καθὰ καὶ τὸ νόμισμα, οὐδὲν δὲ διὰ ταῦτα βελτίονας.	they were beautiful in appearance and well-rounded like the coins, but none the better on that account.
τὸν δὲ περίπατον καταλείπω τῶν γνωρίμων τοῖς βουλομένοις, Βούλωνι, Καλλίνῳ, Ἀρίστωνι, Ἀμφίωνι, Λύκωνι, Πύθωνι, Ἀριστομάχῳ, Ἡρακλείῳ, Λυκομήδει, Λύκωνι τῷ ἀδελφιδῷ.	I leave the Peripatus to such of my friends as choose to make use of it, to Bulo, Callinus, Ariston, Amphion, Lyco, Pytho, Aristomachus, Heracleus, Lycomedes, and my nephew Lyco.
οἱ δ᾽ ὅμοιοι καὶ ἀδιάφοροι ἄπειροι, ὥστ᾽ οὐθὲν μᾶλλον ἥδε ἡ τριὰς αὐτοάνθρωπος ἢ ὁποιαοῦν ], εἰ δὲ μὴ εἰσὶν ἀριθμοὶ αἱ ἰδέαι, οὐδ᾽ ὅλως οἷόν τε αὐτὰς εἶναι [ ἐκ τίνων γὰρ ἔσονται ἀρχῶν αἱ ἰδέαι;	e. g. one of humanity and another one of animality; but the numbers which are similar and do not differ in kind are infinitely many, so that this is no more the idea of man than any other 3 is. but if the ideas are not numbers, they cannot exist at all; for from what principles can the ideas be derived?
οἱ Χαδιάσαι καὶ Ἁμμίδιοι, τετρακὀσιοι εἴκοσι δύο· οἱ ἐκ Κειράμας Κάββης, ἑξακόσιοι εἴκοσι εἷς·	the Chadiasans and Ammidians, four hundred and twenty-two; those from Kirama Geba, six hundred and twenty-one;
καὶ ἃ τότε ἔφαμεν ἄλλην δύναμιν ἔχειν καὶ οὐκ εἶναι τὸ ἕτερον οἷον τὸ ἕτερον, τὰ τοῦ προσώπου μόρια, ἁμῇ γέ πῃ προσέοικεν καὶ ἔστιν τὸ ἕτερον οἷον τὸ ἕτερον.	and the things which we spoke of before as having different faculties and not being of the same kind as each other—the parts of the face—these in some sense resemble one another and are of like sort.
Δημητρίῳ δὲ τῷ Ἀντιγόνου διαφορὰ μὲν ἦν ἐς τὸν δῆμον ἤδη τῶν Ἀθηναίων, καθεῖλε δὲ ὅμως καὶ τὴν Λαχάρους τυραννίδα·	Although Demetrius the son of Antigonus was now at variance with the Athenian people, he notwithstanding deposed Lachares too from his tyranny, who, on the capture of the fortifications, escaped to Boeotia.
ταῦτα ἤρεσε τοῖς παροῦσι, καὶ πάντες ἐπῄνεσαν, καὶ ἐμέ τε ὁ Καλλίας οὐκ ἔφη ἀφήσειν καὶ ἑλέσθαι ἐδέοντο ἐπιστάτην.	His proposal was approved by the company, and they all applauded it Callias said he would not let me go, and they requested me to choose a supervisor.
ἑτέρῳ δὲ τόπῳ ἁρμόσουσιν πολὺ ἐλάττονι, καὶ τοῦτο ὅταν βασανισθωσιν καὶ ἐκπληρώσωσιν τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν. καὶ διὰ τοῦτο μετατεθήσονται, ὅτι μετέλαβον τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ δικαίου.	But they will fit into another place much less honourable, and even this only after they have been tormented and fulfilled the days of their sins, and for this reason they will be removed, because they shared in the righteous Word.
ὁ δ’ ἐξαίφνης ἐπιπεσὼν οὐ προαισθομένῳ καὶ φοβήσας ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ στρατηγῷ τὸ στρατόπεδον·	But Demetrius fell upon him suddenly and took him by surprise, put him to rout, and captured his camp, general and all
συνελθόντος δὲ τοῦ δῆμον πρῶτον μὲν οὐ κατὰ λόχους, ἀλλὰ κατὰ φυλὰς ἐβιάζοντο γίνεσθαι τὴν ψηφοφορίαν, τῶν εὐπόρων καὶ γνωρίμων καὶ στρατευομένων τὸν ἄπορον καὶ πολυπράγμονα καὶ τὸν καλοῦ φροντίζοντα μηδὲν ὄχλον ἐπίπροσθεν ταῖς ψήφοις ποιοῦντες.	But when the people were come together, in the first place, the tribunes insisted that the votes be cast not by centuries, but by tribes, thus making the indigent and officious rabble, which had no thought of honour, superior in voting power to the wealthy and well known citizens of the military class.
ἐὰν σύ γε, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐᾷς καὶ συμβουλεύῃς ἄρχειν, προθυμήσομαι·	Certainly if you, Socrates, allow and counsel me to govern, I shall do so gladly
καὶ αὐτὸν δὲ τὸν Ὄλυμπον ἐκεῖνον, ᾧ δὴ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς τε καὶ νομικῆς μούσης ἀποδιδόασι, τό τε τῆς ἁρμονίας γένος ἐξευρεῖν φασι, καὶ τῶν ῥυθμῶν τόν τε προσοδιακὸν ἐν ᾧ ὁ τοῦ Ἄρεως νόμος, καὶ τὸν χορεῖον ᾧ πολλῷ κέχρηται ἐν τοῖς Μητρῴοις·	To the same Olympus to whom they also ascribe the first invention of Grecian and well-regulated nomic music they attribute likewise the finding out the enharmonic music, the prosodiac measure to which is composed the hymn to Mars, and the chorean measure which he used in the hymns to the Mother of the Gods.
οὐκ ἆρα μὰ Δἴ ἡμῖν ἔτ᾽ ἔργον ἑστάναι. ἀλλ᾽ ὡς τάχιστα σὺ μὲν ἰὼν τὰς ἀρρίχους καὶ τοὺς κοφίνους ἅπαντας ἐμπίμπλη πτερῶν· Μανῆς δὲ φερέτω μοι θύραζε τὰ πτερά· ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἐκείνων τοὺς προσιόντας δέξομαι. ταχὺ δὴ πολυάνορα τάνδε πόλιν καλεῖ τις ἀνθρώπων. τύχη μόνον προσείη. κατέχουσι δ᾽ ἔρωτες ἐμᾶς πόλεως.	ah! by zeus, there's no time for idling. to some slaves. go as quick as possible and fill every hamper, every basket you can find with wings. manes will bring them to me outside the walls, where i will welcome those who present themselves. singing. this town will soon be inhabited by a crowd of men. fortune favours us alone and thus they have fallen in love with our city. to the slave manes, who brings in a basket full of wings.
καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τοὺς εἴκοσι πήχεις ἀπ᾽ ἄκρου τοῦ τοίχου, τὸ πλευρὸν τὸ ἓν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐδάφους ἕως τῶν δοκῶν· καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκ τοῦ δαβεὶρ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων.	He built twenty cubits from the edge of the wall on the one side from the floor up to the beams, and he made this from the inner sanctuary to the holy of holies.

οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐς τὴν Σικελίαν, ἵναπερ τὸ πρῶτον ὥρμηντο, ἀποπλεύσαντες μετὰ τῶν ἐκεῖ ξυμμάχων ἐπολέμουν.	Meanwhile the Athenians sailed off to Sicily, their primary destination, and carried on the war with their allies there.
Τῷ Δαυείδ. Εὐλόγει, ἡ ψυχή μου, τὸν κύριον· Κύριε, Κύριε, ὁ θεός μου, ὡς ἐμεγαλύνθης σφόδρα. ἐξομολόγησιν καὶ εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσω,	By David.
πλέον μὲν ἢ κατὰ τὸ στόμα, μεῖον δ’ ἢ κατὰ τὸ ἧπάρ τε καὶ τὰς φλέβας.	The alteration is more than that which occurs in the mouth, but less than that in the liver and veins.
καὶ γάρ τις καὶ στρατιὰ Λακεδαιμονίων οὐ πολλὴ ἔτυχε κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἐν ᾧ περὶ ταῦτα ἐθορυβοῦντο μέχρι Ἰσθμοῦ παρελθοῦσα, πρὸς Βοιωτούς τι πράσσοντες.	Meanwhile it so happened that, just at the time of this agitation, a small force of Lacedaemonians had advanced as far as the Isthmus, in pursuance of some scheme with the Boeotians.
πάλιν δ’ ἐπεί τις ζητῶν καταμόνας αὐτῷ διελέγετο εὐσταθῶς, ἔπειτα δὲ θεωρῶν προσιόντα ὄχλον ἤρχετο φιλονεικεῖν, ἔφη, οἴμοι, κασίγνητ’, ὄμμα σὸν ταράσσεται·	Again, when somebody who had a question to ask was steadily conversing with him in private, and then upon seeing a crowd approaching began to be more contentious, he said Ah!
Τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν; Καὶ ἀπέκτειναν τοὺς προκαταγγείλαντας περὶ τῆς ἐλεύσεως τοῦ δικαίου, οὗ νῦν ὑμεῖς προδόται καὶ φονεῖς γεγένησθε·	"Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers,
εἰ τοίνυν ἄκροις εἰς φιλοσοφίαν πόλεώς τις ἀνάγκη ἐπιμεληθῆναι ἢ γέγονεν ἐν τῷ ἀπείρῳ τῷ παρεληλυθότι χρόνῳ ἢ καὶ νῦν ἔστιν ἔν τινι βαρβαρικῷ τόπῳ, πόρρω που ἐκτὸς ὄντι τῆς ἡμετέρας ἐπόψεως, ἢ καὶ ἔπειτα γενήσεται, περὶ τούτου ἕτοιμοι τῷ λόγῳ διαμάχεσθαι, ὡς γέγονεν ἡ εἰρημένη πολιτεία καὶ ἔστιν καὶ γενήσεταί γε, ὅταν αὕτη ἡ Μοῦσα πόλεως ἐγκρατὴς γένηται.	If, then, the best philosophical natures have ever been constrained to take charge of the state in infinite time past, or now are in some barbaric region far beyond our ken, or shall hereafter be, we are prepared to maintain our contention that the constitution we have described has been, is, or will be realized when this philosophic Muse has taken control of the state.

ἡμεῖς δὲ πλήθει μὲν οὐδενὶ χαλεπανοῦμεν οὐδὲ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἐπιλεξόμεθα πάντας, ὅσοι διηνέχθησαν ἡμῖν ἢ ἐπεβούλευσαν, οὐδὲ ἐκ πλούτου πάντως ἢ περιουσίας ἢ ἀξιώσεως οὐδ’ ὅσους ἕτερος πρὸ ἡμῶν αὐτοκράτωρ ἔκτεινε, τὴν πόλιν κἀκεῖνος ἐν ἐμφυλίοις καθιστάμενος, ὃν Εὐτυχῆ προσείπατε δι’ εὐπραξίαν, καίπερ ἀνάγκης οὔσης τρισὶ πλέονας ἐχθροὺς ἢ ἑνὶ εἶναι.	We shall not deal harshly with any multitude of men, nor shall we count as enemies all who have opposed us or plotted against us, or those distinguished for their riches merely, their estates, or their high position nor shall we go to the same lengths as another man who held the supreme power before us, when he, too, was regulating the commonwealth in civil convulsions, and whom you named the Fortunate on account of his success
διὰ τοῦτο δίκαιοι ἐσκύλευσαν ἀσεβεῖς, καὶ ὕμνησαν, Κύριε, τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιόν σου, τήν τε ὑπέρμαχόν σου χεῖρα ᾔνεσαν ὁμοθυμαδόν·	Because of this, the righteous plundered the ungodly, and they sang hymns, Lord, to your holy name, and they praised your defending hand with one accord;
τὸν δ’ ὑπολαβόντ’ εἰπεῖν, καὶ σὺ εἴπερ ἀνθρώποις ᾔδεις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν τούτοις τοῖς λαχάνοις ἐχρῶ.	Thereupon Theodorus retorted, And you, if you had known how to associate with men, would have had no use for these vegetables.

Καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν τοῖς Βααλεὶμ καὶ ταῖς Ἀσταρὼθ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Ἀρὰδ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Σιδῶνος καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Μωὰβ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Φυλιστιείμ· καὶ ἐνκατέλιπον τὸν κύριον καὶ οὐκ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτῷ.	The children of Israel continued to do evil before the face of the Lord, and they served the Baalim and the Astartes, the gods of Arad and the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab and the gods of the descendants of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned the Lord and did not serve him.
καλῶς δὴ αὐτὰ διάλαβε, καὶ διὰ μνήμης ἔχων ὀξέως αὐτὰ περιόδευε μετὰ τῶν λοιπῶν ὧν ἐν τῇ μικρᾷ ἐπιτομῇ πρὸς Ἡρόδοτον ἀπεστείλαμεν.	So you will do well to take and learn them and get them up quickly along with the short epitome in my letter to Herodotus.

So Delilah put Samson to sleep upon her knee. Then she summoned a man, and he shaved the seven locks of his head. As she began to humble him, his strength departed from him.
ἐνδέχεται μὲν καὶ παρὰ τὸ κύκλῳ κινούμενα ἐξ ἀρχῆς οὕτω κατηναγκάσθαι, ὥστε τὰ μὲν κατὰ τὴν αὐτὴν δίνην φέρεσθαι ὁμαλῆ οὖσαν, τὰ δὲ κατά τιν’ ἄλλην τισὶν ἀνωμαλίαις χρωμένην.	may be accounted for by saying that they originally moved in a circle and were constrained, some of them to be whirled round with the same uniform rotation and others with a whirling motion which varied
Φαῖδρον, Γνιφωνίδην, Ἰσόνομον, Ἡφαιστόδωρον, Κηφισόδωρον, ἑαυτόν, Διόγνητον, Σμινδυρίδην, Φιλοκράτη, Ἀντιφῶντα, Τείσαρχον, Παντακλέα.	phaedrus, gniphonides, isonomus, hephaestodorus, cephisodorus, himself, diognetus, smindyrides, philocrates, antiphon, teisarchus, pantacles.

Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Βάλετε εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ μέρη τοῦ πλοίου τὸ δίκτυον, καὶ εὑρήσετε. Ἔβαλον οὖν, καὶ οὐκέτι αὐτὸ ἑλκύσαι ἴσχυσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους τῶν ἰχθύων.	And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.
θαρσοῦντες οὖν καὶ κυβερνῆται καὶ ναῦται τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἕκαστος ἕπεσθε, χώραν μὴ προλείποντες ᾗ ἄν τις προσταχθῇ.	Steersmen and sailors may, therefore, confidently attend to their several duties, none quitting the station assigned to them
πάντων ἄρ’ ἀνθρώπων ῥᾳθυμότατοι ἔσεσθε, καὶ ἥκιστα ἐπὶ τοῖς δεινοῖς ὀργιζόμενοι.	If you do not it will show an apathy and lack of righteous indignation completely without parallel.
αἰσχυνθείησαν καὶ ἐντραπείησαν οἱ ζητοῦντές μου τὴν ψυχήν, ἀποστραφείησαν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ καταισχυνθείησαν οἱ βουλόμενοί μοι κακά·	May those who seek my soul be put to shame, and may they be turned about. May those who want evil things for me be turned backwards, and may they be disgraced.
Γρηγορεῖτε οὖν· οὐκ οἴδατε γὰρ πότε ὁ κύριος τῆς οἰκίας ἔρχεται, ὀψέ, ἢ μεσονυκτίου, ἢ ἀλεκτοροφωνίας, ἢ πρωΐ·	"Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming -- in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning --
ἐπῄνει τοὺς μέλλοντας γαμεῖν καὶ μὴ γαμεῖν, καὶ τοὺς μέλλοντας καταπλεῖν καὶ μὴ καταπλεῖν, καὶ τοὺς μέλλοντας πολιτεύεσθαι καὶ μὴ πολιτεύεσθαι, καὶ τοὺς παιδοτροφεῖν καὶ μὴ παιδοτροφεῖν, καὶ τοὺς παρασκευαζομένους συμβιοῦν τοῖς δυνάσταις καὶ μὴ προσιόντας.	He would praise those who were about to marry and refrained, those who intending to go a voyage never set sail, those who thinking to engage in politics do no such thing, those also who purposing to rear a family do not do so, and those who make ready to live with potentates, yet never come near them after all.
κληρονομίαν Ἰσραὴλ δούλῳ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.	an inheritance to Israel, his servant, because forever is his mercy;
ἠθύμει δὲ δεινῶς διὰ τὸ μηδαμοῦ φανερὰν τὴν ἔλαφον ἐκείνην εἶναι· μηχανῆς γὰρ ἐπὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους ἐστέρητο θαυμαστῆς, τότε δὴ μάλιστα παραμυθίας δεομένους, εἶτα μέντοι νυκτὸς ἄλλως πλανώμενοί τινες ἐπιτυγχάνουσιν αὐτῇ, καί γνωρίσαντες ἀπὸ τῆς χρόας λαμβάνουσιν.	He was now greatly disheartened because that doe of his was nowhere to be found; for he was thus deprived of a wonderful contrivance for influencing the Barbarians, who at this time particularly stood in need of encouragement. Soon, however, some men who were roaming about at night on other errands came upon the doe, recognized her by her colour, and caught her.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ὑψώθησαν αἱ θυγατέρες Σειών, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὑψηλῷ τραχήλῳ καὶ ἐν νεύμασιν ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ τῇ πορείᾳ τῶν ποδῶν ἅμα σύρουσαι τοὺς χιτῶνας καὶ τοῖς ποσὶν ἅμα παίζουσαι,	This is what the Lord says: “Instead of these things, the daughters of Zion were exalted, and they went with a high neck and with winks of the eyes and with the gait of the feet, trailing their shirts and at the same time playing amorously with their feet.”
καὶ νῦν ἐπικαλέσασθε αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔκδοσθε τὴν πόλιν πᾶσαν εἰς προνομὴν τῷ λαῷ Ὀλοφέρνου καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ.	Now, call them and surrender the whole city to the men of Holofernes and all of his army for plunder.

Χῖ λαμβάνεται πρὸς τὰς λέξεις καὶ τὰ σχήματα καὶ ὅλως τὴν Πλατωνικὴν συνήθειαν·	The cross X is taken to indicate peculiar expressions and figures of speech, and generally any idiom of Platonic usage
καὶ ἡ ἵππος ἐσκορπίσθη ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Ἄζωτον, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς Βηθδαγὼν τὸ εἰδώλιον αὐτῶν τοῦ σωθῆναι.	And the cavalry was dispersed on the plain. And they fled to Ashdod and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, for deliverance.

δέομαι δ᾽ ὑμῶν, ὦ ἄνδρες, τῶν μεγίστων κριταὶ καὶ κύριοι, ἐλεήσαντας τὴν ἀτυχίαν μου ἰατροὺς γενέσθαι αὐτῆς, καὶ μὴ συνεπιβάντας τῇ τούτων ἐπιθέσει περιιδεῖν ἀδίκως καὶ ἀθέως διαφθαρέντα με ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν. ἥ τε ἀτυχία ἀδικεῖται ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἣν προϊστάμενος τῆς κακουργίας ἀφανίσαι τὴν αὑτοῦ μιαρίαν ζητεῖ· ὑπό τε ὑμῶν οὐκ ἄξιος ἐλεεῖσθαί ἐστιν, ἀκούσιον μὲν τῷ παθόντι περιθεὶς τὴν συμφοράν, ἑκουσίως δὲ αὐτὸς εἰς τοὺς κινδύνους καταστάς.	instead, i entreat you, gentlemen, you who are empowered to decide the most critical of issues; take pity on my misfortune and remedy it; do not join my opponents in their attack; do not allow them to make an end of me without regard to justice or the powers above. it is an outrage to " misfortune " that he should use it to cloak his crime, in the hope of concealing his defilement. neither does he deserve your " pity " he did not consult his victim's wishes
οὐκοῦν καὶ ἰατρικήν, οἵαν εἴπομεν, μετὰ τῆς τοιαύτης δικαστικῆς κατὰ πόλιν νομοθετήσεις, αἳ τῶν πολιτῶν σοι τοὺς μὲν εὐφυεῖς τὰ σώματα καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς θεραπεύσουσι, τοὺς δὲ μή, ὅσοι μὲν κατὰ σῶμα τοιοῦτοι, ἀποθνῄσκειν ἐάσουσιν, τοὺς δὲ κατὰ τὴν ψυχὴν κακοφυεῖς καὶ ἀνιάτους αὐτοὶ ἀποκτενοῦσιν;	Then will you not establish by law in your city such an art of medicine as we have described in conjunction with this kind of justice? And these arts will care for the bodies and souls of such of your citizens as are truly well born, but of those who are not, such as are defective in body they will suffer to die and those who are evil-natured and incurable in soul they will themselves put to death.

Now then, Glaucon, is the time for us like huntsmen to surround the covert and keep close watch that justice may not slip through and get away from us and vanish from our sight. It plainly must be somewhere hereabouts.
πάσαισι γὰρ πολίεσι λόγος ὁμιλεῖ Ἐρεχθέος ἀστῶν, Ἄπολλον, οἳ τεόν γε δόμον Πυθῶνι δίᾳ θαητὸν ἔτευξαν.	For in all cities the story of the citizens of Erechtheus makes the rounds, Apollo, how they made your dwelling in divine Pytho a marvel to see.
ἀλλὰ καὶ Πολέμωνος. Ἑκάτων δέ φησι καὶ Ἀπολλώνιος ὁ Τύριος ἐν πρώτῳ περὶ Ζήνωνος, χρηστηριασαμένου αὐτοῦ τί πράττων ἄριστα βιώσεται, ἀποκρίνασθαι τὸν θεόν, εἰ συγχρωτίζοιτο τοῖς νεκροῖς·	It is stated by Hecato and by Apollonius of Tyre in his first book on Zeno that he consulted the oracle to know what he should do to attain the best life, and that the god’s response was that he should take on the complexion of the dead.
καὶ λέγει ἡ ὄνος τῷ Βαλαάμ Οὐκ ἐγὼ ἡ ὄνος σου, ἐφ᾽ ἧς ἐπέβαινες ἀπὸ νεότητός σου ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας; μὴ ὑπεροράσει ὑπεριδοῦσα ἐποίησά σοι οὕτως; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Οὐχί.	But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, upon which you have been riding from your youth until this very day? Have I ever treated you with utter contempt, disregarding you in this way?” And Balaam said, “No.”
καὶ τὴν ἔρημον, καὶ τὰ περίχωρα Ἰερειχώ, πόλιν φοινίκων, ἕως Σήγωρ.	and the wilderness and the country around Jericho, city of date palms, as far as Zoar.
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ τοῖς ὑπάτοις προσεγένοντο ἱππεῖς Κελτίβηρες, ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰβηρίᾳ στρατηγῶν ἀπεσταλμένοι, καὶ γενομένης παρὰ τὸν Γλάνιν ποταμὸν ἱππομαχίας ὁ μὲν Σύλλας ἔκτεινεν ἐς πεντήκοντα τῶν πολεμίων, διακόσιοι δὲ καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα τῶνδε τῶν Κελτιβήρων ηὐτομόλησαν ἐς Σύλλαν·	In the meantime a body of Celtiberian horse, sent by the prætors in Spain, had joined the consuls, and there was a cavalry fight on the banks of the river Glanis.
Μετανοήσατε, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνομίας ὑμῶν: εἶπον τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ μου. Ἐὰν ὦσιν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ὑμῶν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐὰν ὦσιν πυρρότεραι κόκκου καὶ μελανώτεραι σάκκου, καὶ ἐπιστραφῆτε πρός με ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας καὶ εἴπητε: Πάτερ: ἐπακούσομαι ὑμῶν ὡς λαοῦ ἁγίου.	Repent, O house of Israel, from your iniquity. Say to the sons of my people. If your sins reach from the earth to Heaven, and if they be redder than scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth, and ye turn to me with all your hearts and say ‘Father,’ I will listen to you as a holy people.
φασὶ δὲ καὶ πρὸ ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν αὐτοῦ τελευτῆσαι πεντηκοστὸν τρίτον ἔτος ἄγοντα, καὶ αὐτὸς Ἐπίκουρος ἐν ταῖς προειρημέναις διαθήκαις, ὡς προαπεληλυθότος αὐτοῦ δηλονότι, ἐπισκήπτει περὶ τῆς ἐπιμελείας αὐτοῦ τῶν παίδων.	He died, we learn, seven years before Epicurus in his fiftythird year, and Epicurus himself in his will already cited clearly speaks of him as departed, and enjoins upon his executors to make provision for Metrodorus’s children.
Ἀγάθων, ἐπειδὴ σαυτὸν ἐπιδοῦναι φθονεῖς, ἀλλ᾽ ἱμάτιον γοῦν χρῆσον ἡμῖν τουτῳὶ καὶ στρόφιον·	agathon, you refuse to devote yourself to helping me; but at any rate lend me a tunic and a belt.
αὖθις δ’ ᾤκισαν ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν, ἀγχοτάτω μάλιστα τῆς προτέρας, ὡς εὔκαιρον ἐπὶ Λιβύῃ χωρίον.	But another city was built subsequently by their own people, very near the former one, for convenience in governing Africa.
Κλέων δὲ ἐνταῦθα δὴ πολὺς ἐνέκειτο, λέγων γιγνώσκειν μὲν καὶ πρότερον οὐδὲν ἐν νῷ ἔχοντας δίκαιον αὐτούς, σαφὲς δ’ εἶναι καὶ νῦν,οἵτινες τῷ μὲν πλήθει οὐδὲν ἐθέλουσιν εἰπεῖν, ὀλίγοις δὲ ἀνδράσι ξύνεδροι βούλονται γίγνεσθαι· ἀλλὰ εἴ τι ὑγιὲς διανοοῦνται, λέγειν ἐκέλευσεν ἅπασιν.	Hereupon Cleon violently assailed them, saying that he knew from the first that they had no right intentions, and that it was clear enough now by their refusing to speak before the people, and wanting to confer in secret with a committee of two or three. No! if they meant anything honest let them say it out before all.
νουμηνίας δὲ ἔτους ἐς τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν ἡμέραν οὔσης, φυλάξας ὁ Λεύκιος τὴν ἑορτὴν ὡς ἀμελείας τοῖς πολεμίοις αἰτίαν ἐξέθορε νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὰς πύλας αὐτῶν ὡς διεκπαίσων αὐτοὺς καὶ στρατιὰν ἐπαξόμενος ἑτέραν·	On the day preceding the Calends of January, Lucius thought to avail himself of the holiday, under the belief that the enemy would be off their guard, to make a sally by night against their gates, hoping to break through them and bring in his other forces, of which he had abundance in many places.
οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ παραλογισμοί, εἰς πρᾶξιν ἐπιθυμίας ἀδίκων.	His words are frauds, for acting on desires for unrighteous things.
Ἔρχεται Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ ἀπαγγέλλουσα τοῖς μαθηταῖς ὅτι ἑώρακεν τὸν κύριον, καὶ ταῦτα εἶπεν αὐτῇ.	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.
ἐκ τούτου πρέσβεις ἀφίκοντο περὶ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων οἱ περὶ Γάιον Φαβρίκιον, οὗ πλεῖστον ἔφη Ῥωμαίους λόγον ἔχειν ὁ Κινέας ὡς ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ καὶ πολεμικοῦ, πένητος δὲ ἰσχυρῶς τοῦτον οὖν ὁ Πύρρος ἰδίᾳ φιλοφρονούμενος ἔπειθε λαβεῖν χρυσίον, ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ δῆθεν αἰσχρῷ, φιλίας δέ τι καὶ ξενίας ἐπονομάζων τοῦτο σύμβολον.	After this, an embassy came from the Romans to treat about the prisoners that had been taken. The embassy was headed by Caius Fabricius, who, as Cineas reported, was held in highest esteem at Rome as an honourable man and good soldier, but was inordinately poor. To this man, then, Pyrrhus privately showed kindness and tried to induce him to accept gold, not for any base purpose, indeed, but calling it a mark of friendship and hospitality.
καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀγγέλοις υἱοῦ Ἁδέρ Λέγετε τῷ κυρίῳ ὑμῶν Πάντα ὅσα ἀπέσταλκας πρὸς τὸν δοῦλόν σου ἐν πρώτοις ποιήσω, τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι· καὶ ἀπῆραν οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν αὐτῷ λόγον.	He said to the messengers of the son of Hadad, “Say to your lord, ‘All that you send to your servant on the first occasion I will do, but this matter I will not be able to do.’ ” The men left and returned to him the word.
ὡς οὖν τάχιστα προσηγάγετο τοῦτον ὁ Ἆγις, εὐθὺς ἐπιχειρεῖ μετ’ αὐτοῦ τὴν μητέρα πείθειν, ἀδελφὴν οὖσαν τοῦ Ἀγησιλάου, πλήθει δὲ πελατῶν καὶ φίλων καὶ χρεωστῶν μέγα δυναμένην ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ πολλὰ τῶν κοινῶν διαπραττομένην.	As soon, then, as Agis had won over Agesilaüs, he straightway sought with the aid of his uncle to persuade his mother, who was a sister of Agesilaüs, and owing to the multitude of her retainers, friends, and debtors, had great influence in the state and took a large part in public affairs.
τοῖς μὲν οὖν Πελοποννησίοις γενομένου τούτου ἀπροσδοκήτου τε καὶ παρὰ λόγον φόβος ἐμπίπτει, καὶ ἅμα ἀτάκτως διώκοντες διὰ τὸ κρατεῖν αἱ μέν τινες τῶν νεῶν καθεῖσαι τὰς κώπας ἐπέστησαν τοῦ πλοῦ, ἀξύμφορον δρῶντες πρὸς τὴν ἐξ ὀλίγου ἀντεφόρμησιν, βουλόμενοι τὰς πλείους περιμεῖναι, αἱ δὲ καὶ ἐς βράχεα ἀπειρίᾳ χωρίων ὤκειλαν.	An exploit so sudden and unexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians; and having fallen out of order in the excitement of victory, some of them dropped their oars and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up—an unsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy's prows; while others ran aground in the shallows, in their ignorance of the localities.
Κυνίσκας δὲ ὕστερον γυναιξὶ καὶ ἄλλαις καὶ μάλιστα ταῖς ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος γεγόνασιν Ὀλυμπικαὶ νῖκαι, ὧν ἐπιφανεστέρα ἐς τὰς νίκας οὐδεμία ἐστὶν αὐτῆς.	After Cynisca other women, especially women of Lacedaemon, have won Olympic victories, but none of them was more distinguished for their victories than she.
ὡς δ’ ᾔσθετο τῶν προαπεσταλμένων ἐν ἀσφαλεῖ γεγονότων, ἐξίππευσεν ἐς αὐτοὺς μετὰ καταφρονήσεως, ὀξέως οὕτως ὡς μηδ’ αἰσθέσθαι τοὺς διώκοντας ὅποι διέδραμεν.	When he judged that those who had been sent before had reached a place of safety, he darted after them with such disregard of the enemy and such swiftness that his pursuers did not know whither he had gone.
καὶ τῆς εὐμορφίας τῶν γυναικῶν ἐπερεθισμὸν τοῦ σπερματικοῦ κινήματος ἐμποιησάσης. τῶν δὲ ζῴων πάντων τὰ γένη διακριθῆναι διὰ τὰς ποιὰς κράσεις τὰ μὲν οἰκειότερα εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ τὴν ὁρμὴν ἔχειν, τὰ δ’ εἰς ἀέρα ἀναπνεῖν, ὅσ’ ἂν πυρῶδες ἔχῃ τὸ πλέον, τὰ δὲ βαρύτερα ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, τὰ δ’ ἰσόμοιρα τῇ κράσει πᾶσι τοῖς θώραξι πεφωνηκέναι.	All sorts of animals are discriminated by their proper temperament and constitution some are carried by a proper appetite and inclination to water some, which partake of a more fiery quality, to breathe in the air those that are heavier incline to the earth but those animals whose parts are of a just and equal temperament are fitted equally for all places.
μετὰ ταῦτα ἤδη διεξῄει περὶ τοῦ πράγματος καὶ μάλα εἰδότως καὶ σαφῶς.	After he had given you this information, “What is it, fellow citizens,” said he, “that I advise?
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς μέ Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰ ζήσεται τὰ ὀστᾶ ταῦτα; καὶ εἶπα Κύριε, σὺ ἐπίστῃ ταῦτα.	And he said to me, “Son of man, will these bones live?” And I said, “O Lord, you know these things.”
ἀλλ’ ἀνέβα χεῖλος ποτ’ ὀδόντας ἐρείσας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα συνδακών.	But he soared aloft with his lip tightly pressed against his teeth And holding his breath withal.
οὐ μὴν οὐδ’ οἱ Ῥωμύλον τῷ δικαιοτάτῳ τῶν λόγων ἀποφαίνοντες ἐπώνυμον τῆς πόλεως ὁμολογοῦσι περὶ τοῦ γένους αὐτοῦ.	and others still that it was Romis, tyrant of the Latins, after he had driven out the Tuscans, who passed from Thessaly into Lydia, and from Lydia into Italy. Moreover, even those writers who declare, in accordance with the most authentic tradition, that it was Romulus who gave his name to the city, do not agree about his lineage.
ὅσον δ’ ἑκάτερον τούτων ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων διέστηκε καὶ ὡς πολὺ διαφέρει, ἐν τοῖς ἐφεξῆς ὑμᾶς πειράσομαι λόγοις διδάσκειν.	How wide indeed is the distinction between these two acts and how great the difference, I will try to show you in what I shall next say.
ὅσα δὲ ἐξ ἐπιμελείας καὶ ἀσκήσεως καὶ διδαχῆς οἴονται γίγνεσθαι ἀγαθὰ ἀνθρώποις, ἐάν τις ταῦτα μὴ ἔχῃ, ἀλλὰ τἀναντία τούτων κακά, ἐπὶ τούτοις που οἵ τε θυμοὶ γίγνονται καὶ αἱ κολάσεις καὶ αἱ νουθετήσεις.	But as to all the good things that people are supposed to get by application and practice and teaching, where these are lacking in anyone and only their opposite evils are found, here surely are the occasions for wrath and punishment and reproof.
καὶ ὅλως δηλοῖ ἀεὶ προαιρούμενος τί τε καὶ τίνος ἕνεκα προαιρεῖται, ἔστι δὲ τὸ μὲν τίνος, οὗ ἕνεκα προαιρεῖται ἄλλο, τὸ δὲ τί, ὃ προαιρεῖται ἕνεκα ἄλλου.	and generally, one who makes a choice always makes it clear both what his choice is and what its object is, 'object' meaning that for the sake of which he chooses something else and 'choice' meaning that which he chooses for the sake of something else.
ἐκεῖναι γὰρ ἅμα θεοῦ παρουσίᾳ παραγιγνόμεναι τοῖς σώμασι κατὰ λογισμὸν ἰσχυράν τε καὶ καλὴν φύσιν ἔχουσι.	Nay, those two also, since they enter into human bodies at the very same time with God himself, claim by reason a vigorous and incomparable nature.
ἄκακοι καὶ εὐθεῖς ἐκολλῶντό μοι, ὅτι ὑπέμεινά σε, Κύριε.	Innocent ones and upright ones joined fast together to me, because I awaited you, O Lord.
καί τὸ μὲν πλῆθος ἐπῄνεσεν, ὡς πρὸς αὐτὸν εὔνουν καί πρόθυμον, ὀλίγους δέ τινας οὐκ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ φήσας ὑποικουρεῖν, διαβάλλοντας αὐτοῦ τὴν μετριότητα καί τὴν ἐκείνων εὐστάθειαν, ἠξίου συναγανακτεῖν καί συγκολάζειν.	There he commended the great body of the soldiers for their goodwill and zeal in his service, but said that there were a few of them who were intriguing to no good purpose, thereby bringing his moderation and their fidelity into disrepute, and he demanded that they share his resentment against these and assist him in punishing them.
καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτὸς ἐν πύλῃ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος παρ᾽ ᾧ κατέλυεν Σαρουιὰ υἱὸς Σελεμίου υἱοῦ Ἁνανίου, καὶ συνέλαβεν τὸν Ἰερεμίαν λέγων Πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους σὺ φεύγεις;	And he was at the gate of Benjamin; and there was a person with whom he had lodged—Zeruiah, son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah—and he captured Jeremiah, saying, “You are fleeing to the Chaldeans!”
ὅτι οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐκρύβη τὰ ἀδικήματα αὐτῶν ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου.	because my eyes are upon all their ways, and their wrongs have not been were hidden ⌊from⌋ my eyes.
ὅτι δὲ τοσαῦτά ἐστι τἀμὰ σὺν τοῖς τοῦ ἐκποιήτου ὑέος, καὶ ψευδομαρτυριῶν ἐνεστᾶσι δίκαι περὶ τῶν Ἁγνίου, λαβὲ τὰς μαρτυρίας καὶ ἀνάγνωθι. Μαρτυρίαι	To prove that this is the amount of my property, including that of my son who has been adopted into another family, and that suits for perjury in connection with Hagnias's estate are still pending, take and read the depositions.Depositions
διὸ εὐθὺς τὰ ὅμοια ἀλλήλοις χαίρει, καὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ἥδιστον ἄνθρωπος.	By nature at all events the absolutely good is absolutely pleasant, and the relatively good is pleasant to those for whom it is good. Hence ipso facto like takes pleasure in like, and man is the thing most pleasant to man
ἴθι δὴ σὺ περιδοῦ καὶ ταχέως ἀνὴρ γενοῦ·	come, look sharp, on with your beard and become a man.
παρεγένοντο δὲ καὶ Βοιωτῶν ἑπτακόσιοι ἐκ Θεσπείας καὶ ἐκ Θηβῶν τετρακόσιοι.	of the Boeotians there mustered seven hundred from Thespiae and four hundred from Thebes.
τοῖς δὲ Πάρθοις παρακεκριμένοις λόγου κρείττων ἡ τάξις ἐφαίνετο τῶν Ῥωμαίων, καὶ κατεθεῶντο παρεξιόντας ἐν διαστήμασιν ἴσοις ἀθορύβως καὶ σιωπῇ τοὺς ὑσσοὺς κραδαίνοντας.	To the Parthians in their parallel array, the discipline of the Romans seemed to beggar description, and they watched them marching past at equal distances from one another, without confusion, and in silence, brandishing their javelins.
καὶ γὰρ καὶ δυνατωτάτη πάντα ξυμπαθέα ποιῆσαι, καὶ νεῦρα, καὶ γνώμην.	for it is very potent to make the other parts sympathise with it, as the nerves and the understanding
οὐ παιδευθήσεται ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν πανοῦργος· ἔστιν πανουργία πληθύνουσα πικρίαν.	Whoever is not crafty will not be disciplined. There is a craftiness that increases bitterness.
ἐκ δὲ Κυρτώνων ὑπερβάλλοντι τὸ ὄρος πόλισμά ἐστι Κορσεία, ὑπὸ δὲ αὐτῷ δένδρων ἄλσος οὐχ ἡμέρων· πρῖνοι τὸ πολύ εἰσιν.	Going out of Cyrtones, as you cross the mountain you come to Corseia, under which is a grove of trees that are not cultivated, being mostly evergreen oaks.
καὶ γὰρ εἶναι τῶν ἠϊθέων ἕνα Μενέσθην Σκίρου θυγατριδοῦν. μαρτυρεῖ δὲ τούτοις ἡρῷα Ναυσιθόου καὶ Φαίακος εἱσαμένου Θησέως Φαληροῖ πρὸς τῷ τοῦ Σκίρου ἱερῷ, καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τὰ Κυβερνήσιά φασιν ἐκείνοις τελεῖσθαι.	And there is evidence for this in the memorial chapels for Nausithous and Phaeax which Theseus built at Phalerum near the temple of Scirus, and they say that the festival of the Cybernesia, or Pilot’s Festival, is celebrated in their honor.
εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ μικροῦ, ὁ αὐτὸς ἐκείνῳ ἔσται τῷ τῶν ἰδεῶν [ ἐξ ἄλλου δέ τινος μικροῦ καὶ μεγάλου τὰ [γὰρ] μεγέθη ποιεῖ ]·	for if it is composed of the great and small, it will be the same as the former, i. e. ideal, number. but of what other great and small can it be composed? for plato makes spatial magnitudes out of a great and small.
ἢν δὲ ὀλίγοι τε στρατηγοὶ γένωνται ἔμπειροι καὶ ἐν τῷ χειμῶνι τούτῳ παρασκευάσωσι τὸ ὁπλιτικόν, οἷς τε ὅπλα μὴ ἔστιν ἐκπορίζοντες, ὅπως ὡς πλεῖστοι ἔσονται, καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ μελέτῃ προσαναγκάζοντες, ἔφη κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς κρατήσειν σφᾶς τῶν ἐναντίων, ἀνδρείας μὲν σφίσιν ὑπαρχούσης, εὐταξίας δ’ ἐς τὰ ἔργα προσγενομένης·	But if they were to have a few skilful generals, and used this winter in preparing their heavy infantry, finding arms for such as had not got any, so as to make them as numerous as possible, and forcing them to attend to their training generally, they would have every chance of beating their adversaries, courage being already theirs and discipline in the field having thus been added to it.
χρυσοστεφάνου δέ οἱ Ἥβας καρπὸν ἀνθήσαντ’ ἀποδρέψαι ἔθελον.	They wanted to pluck the flowering fruit of golden-crowned Youth.
εἰπὼν οὖν ταῦτα πολλοῖς θόρυβον παρέσχεν καὶ ἔπαινον τῶν ἀκουόντων·	This speech of his won a clamorous approval from many of his hearers
προπτερ θυε δεξετ τιμερε ηυιυσμοδι, ιν αλιις αυτεμ μυλτο διλιγενξιυς οβσεθυι θυαμ σι εμπτα ϝενισσετ αδ δομυμ. μαγνο ενιμ πρεξιο εμπτα φυιτ, σοξιετατε ναμθυε ϝιτε ετ προτεξτιονε λιβερορυμ, θυιβυς νιλ μαιυς νεξ σανξτιυς φιερετ. αδηυξ ινσυπερ σι θυιδεμ ξυμ φελιξι ϝιρο ϝιχισσετ, νον θυοθυε σιμιλιτερ φιερετ διϝυλγατα. ετ θυιδεμ νον μοδιξυμ εστ υτι βενε προσπεριτατε ετ νον ηυμιλιτερ, ϝερυμ εξιαμ αδϝερσιτατεμ βενε συφφερρε μυλτο μαγις μεριτο ηονορατυρ.	wherefore, whilst careful to avoid such misplaced obedience, in other respects she will serve him more assiduously than if she had been a bondwoman bought and taken home.
ὅπου γὰρ τὸ τοῦ ἡλίου φῶς ἀνακλώμενον ἀπὸ τῆς σελήνης τὴν μὲν θερμότητα πᾶσαν ἀποβάλλει, τῆς δὲ λαμπρότητος αὐτοῦ λεπτὸν ἀφικνεῖται μόλις πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀδρανὲς λείψανον·	and of his brightness, there comes to us with much ado but a small remainder, and that very languishing and weak?
Διόπερ πρῶτος ὁ Ζήνων ἐν τῷ Περὶ ἀνθρώπου φύσεως τέλος εἶπε τὸ ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει ζῆν, ὅπερ ἐστὶ κατ’ ἀρετὴν ζῆν· ἄγει γὰρ πρὸς ταύτην ἡμᾶς ἡ φύσις.	This is why Zeno was the first (in his treatise On the Nature of Man) to designate as the end life in agreement with nature (or living agreeably to nature), which is the same as a virtuous life, virtue being the goal towards which nature guides us.
πλὴν ἑνός γε τῶν συνήθων ἐν τῷ δωματίῳ παρόντος ἀναπτύσας δίαιμον, ἰδόντος ἐκείνου καὶ θαυμάσαντος, ταῦτα, εἶπεν, ὦ Κεφάλων, ἐπίχειρα τῆς βασιλικῆς φιλίας.	However, when one of his intimate companions who was with him in his chamber saw him spit blood, and expressed surprise, Such, my dear Cephalo, said Aratus, are the wages of royal friendship.
ὅτι διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἀπαροῦσιν, τὴν φυλακὴν Κυρίου ἣν ἐφυλάξαντο διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ.	For through the command of the Lord they set out; the charge of the Lord, which they kept through the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
ἦν δὲ φόνος ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τῶν ἁλισκομένων, καὶ δισχίλιοι Λακεδαιμονίων ἥκοντες ἐπίκουροι νεωστὶ συγκατεκόπησαν.	Those who were taken prisoners in the camp were slaughtered, and two thousand Lacedaemonians who had recently come as auxiliaries were cut to pieces along with them.
Ὁ τρώγων μου τὴν σάρκα καὶ πίνων μου τὸ αἷμα, ἐν ἐμοὶ μένει, κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ.	"He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.
ἐνέπεσε μὲν ἐς τὸ στράτευμα ἡ ταραχὴ περὶ βαθεῖαν τὴν ἑσπέραν, καὶ ὀλίγοι τὸ κατ’ ἀρχὰς ἐγένοντο οἱ παραχθέντες ἐκ τοῦ νοῦ, ἐδόξαζόν τε οὗτοι κτύπου τε ἐπελαυνομένων ἵππων καὶ ἐφόδου πολεμίων αἰσθάνεσθαι·	It was when evening was turning to night that the confusion fell on the army, and at first only a few became mad, and these imagined that they heard the trampling of horses at a gallop, and the attack of advancing enemies
πεινάσουσιν γὰρ νεώτεροι, καὶ κοπιάσουσιν νεανίσκοι, καὶ ἐκλεκτοὶ ἀνίσχυες ἔσονται·	For young men will hunger, and youths will grow weary, and the choice men will be weak,
ἐθαυμαστώθη ἡ γνῶσίς σου ἐξ ἐμοῦ· ἐκραταιώθη, οὐ μὴ δύνωμαι πρὸς αὐτήν.	Your knowledge was magnified from me. I was strengthened; never would I be strong enough for it.
ἀνθ’ ὧν βασιλεὺς ὀργισθεὶς ἡμῖν, σύμμαχος γενόμενος Λακεδαιμονίοις, παρέσχεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον πεντακισχίλια τάλαντα, ἕως κατέλυσεν ἡμῶν τὴν δύναμιν.	The king in his anger replied by allying himself with Sparta, and furnished her with five thousand talents with which to prosecute the war nor was he satisfied until he had overthrown our empire.
καὶ εἰ μὴ πρῶτον μὲν θεῶν τις ἔσωσε τὸ στρατόπεδον, ἔπειθ’ οἱ στρατιῶται οἱ ὑμέτεροι καὶ οἱ πεζοὶ καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς ἄνδρες ἐγένοντο ἀγαθοί, καὶ παρὰ τὸν ἱππόδρομον τὸν ἐν Ταμύναις ἐκ παρατάξεως μάχῃ κρατήσαντες ὑποσπόνδους ἀφεῖσαν τοὺς πολεμίους, ἐκινδύνευσεν ἂν ἡ πόλις αἴσχιστα παθεῖν·	And had not, in the first place, some god saved the army, and had not then your soldiers, horse and foot, showed themselves brave men, and conquered the enemy in a pitched battle by the hippodrome at Tamynae, and brought them to terms and sent them back, our city would have been in danger of the greatest disaster.
Ἰόβα δ’ ἐπιόντος δόξα ψευδὴς προεπήδησεν, ἀμφὶ τὸν Βαγράδαν ποταμὸν οὐ πολὺ διεστῶτα ὑπεστροφέναι τὸν Ἰόβαν, πορθουμένης αὐτῷ τῆς ἀρχῆς ὑπὸ τῶν γειτόνων, Σαβούρραν στρατηγὸν σὺν ὀλίγοις ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καταλιπόντα.	Meantime, while Juba was advancing a false report preceded him, that he had turned back at the river Bagradas, which was not far distant, because his kingdom had been invaded by his neighbors, and that he had left Saburra, his general, with a small force at the river.
ἄγγελον δ᾽ οὐ μέμψεται πόλις γέρονθ᾽, ἡβῶντα δ᾽ εὐγλώσσῳ φρενί.	the city will find no fault with a messenger, old in years, but with youth in his heart and on his tongue.
διὰ δὴ ταῦτ’ ἐπενόει μεγάλοις καὶ χρονίοις πράγμασι τὴν πατρίδα περιβαλών, καὶ καταστήσας ἐς ἀσχολίας καὶ φόβους, τὸ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τὰ τῶν φίλων ἐν ἀδεεῖ θέσθαι.	For these reasons he thought that, if he could involve his country in arduous and protracted undertakings and plunge it into doubts and fears, he would place his own affairs and those of his friends in a secure position.
νῦν δέ μοι, φίλον κάρα, ἔκβαιν᾽ ἀπήνης τῆσδε, μὴ χαμαὶ τιθεὶς τὸν σὸν πόδ᾽, ὦναξ, Ἰλίου πορθήτορα.	and now, i pray you, my dear lord, dismount from your car, but do not set on common earth the foot, my king, that has trampled upon ilium.
ταύτης γὰρ ἕξιν οὔτ’ ἀνὴρ οὔτε πόλις λαβεῖν ἂν δύναιτο σπουδαιοτέραν οὐδ’ ἀσφαλεστέραν οὐδὲ πλείονος ἀξίαν·	And it was because they acquired just this position that our ancestors in the time of the Persian Wars did not live in the manner of freebooters, now having more than enough for their needs, again reduced to a state of famine and siege and extreme misfortune
εἶτα παρὰ τούτου ὁ ἡμέτερος θεῖος ἠξίωσεν ἂν ἐγγυήσασθαι τὴν ἀδελφήν, ὃς αὐτὸς ξενίας φεύγων ὑπὸ ἑνὸς τῶν φρατόρων ὧν φησιν αὑτοῦ εἶναι, παρὰ τέτταρας ψήφους μετέσχε τῆς πόλεως;	Further, would our uncle have thought of marrying the sister of a man, who, when he was accused of usurping the rights of citizenship by a member of the ward to which he claimed to belong, obtained those rights by a majority of only four votes?
Ὄρθον μὲν πρῶτον κύνα γείνατο Γηρυονῆι· δεύτερον αὖτις ἔτικτεν ἀμήχανον, οὔ τι φατειὸν Κέρβερον ὠμηστήν, Ἀίδεω κύνα χαλκεόφωνον, πεντηκοντακέφαλον, ἀναιδέα τε κρατερόν τε·	first she bore Orthus the hound of Geryones, and then again she bore a second, a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong.
εὐθέτως δὲ καὶ πρὸ ὁδοῦ ἄνθρωπος ὤν φύσει γὰρ αὐτῷ ἀγαθὰ τὰ ἁπλῶς ἀγαθἄ, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀντὶ γυναικὸς καὶ εὐφυὴς ἀφυοῦς, διὰ τοῦ ἡδέος δὲ ἡ ὁδός·	And one who is a human being is well adapted to this and on the way to it (for by nature things that are absolutely good are good to him), and similarly a man rather than a woman and a gifted man rather than a dull one
ῥηθέντων δὲ τούτων, ψήφισμα ἔγραψεν ὁ Φιλοκράτης ἑλέσθαι πρέσβεις πρὸς Φίλιππον ἄνδρας δέκα, οἵτινες διαλέξονται Φιλίππῳ περὶ εἰρήνης καὶ τῶν κοινῇ συμφερόντων Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Φιλίππῳ.	Next Philocrates moved that ten ambassadors be chosen to go to Philip and discuss with him both the question of peace and the common interests of the Athenians and Philip.
φοιτῶντές τε πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἠξίουν αὐτοὺς ἡγεμόνας σφῶν γίγνεσθαι κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς καὶ Παυσανίᾳ μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν, ἤν που βιάζηται.	These resorted to the Athenians and requested them as their kinsmen to become their leaders, and to stop any attempt at violence on the part of Pausanias.
ἔτι γὰρ καὶ νῦν ἁπάντων τῶν περὶ τὴν αἵρεσιν καὶ τὴν δοκιμασίαν κατημελημένων ἴδοιμεν ἂν τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις πράγμασιν οὐκ ἀνεκτοὺς ὄντας, ἐπειδὰν εἰς Ἄρειον πάγον ἀναβῶσιν, ὀκνοῦντας τῇ φύσει χρῆσθαι καὶ μᾶλλον τοῖς ἐκεῖ νομίμοις ἢ ταῖς αὑτῶν κακίαις ἐμμένοντας.	for even now, when everything connected with the election and the examination of magistrates has fallen into neglect, we shall find that those who in all else that they do are insufferable, yet when they enter the Areopagus hesitate to indulge their true nature, being governed rather by its traditions than by their own evil instincts.
Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πάσχα τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς ἀπὸ ἑσπέρας, ἀπὸ δυσμῶν Ἰερειχὼ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ·	And the children of Israel performed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month from evening, from the sunset at Jericho in the area beyond the Jordan on the plain.
καὶ τῇ σοφίᾳ σου κατεσκεύασας ἄνθρωπον ἵνα δεσπόζῃ τῶν ὑπὸ σοῦ γενομένων κτισμάτων,	and by your wisdom made humankind that it might have mastery of the creation you made
ὅμως δ’ οὖν τοιοῦτος ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ὑπάρχων ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις πρᾳότατος ἦν.	And yet, though he was so violent in debate, he was as mild as possible in his conduct.
ἐν δὲ τῷ περιϊέναι καὶ θεᾶσθαι τὰ κατὰ τὴν πόλιν ἐρομένου τινὸς αὐτόν εἰ βούλεται τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου λύραν ἰδεῖν, ἐλάχιστα φροντίζειν ἐκείνης ἔφη, τὴν δὲ Ἀχιλλέως ζητεῖν, ᾗ τὰ κλέα καὶ τὰς πράξεις ὕμνει τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκεῖνος.	As he was going about and viewing the sights of the city, someone asked him if he wished to see the lyre of Paris. For that lyre, said Alexander, I care very little; but I would gladly see that of Achilles, to which he used to sing the glorious deeds of brave men.
ταῦτα δὲ ἐπίστασθε μὲν καὶ αὐτοί, καὶ οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅ τι δεῖ μάρτυρας παρασχέσθαι· ὅμως δέ· ἐγώ τε γὰρ δέομαι ἀναπαύσασθαι, ὑμῶν τ’ ἐνίοις ἥδιον ὡς πλείστων τοὺς αὐτοὺς λόγους ἀκούειν.	But these facts you comprehend of yourselves, and I doubt if I need provide any witnesses. Some, however, I will; for not only am I in need of a rest, but some of you will prefer to hear the same statements from as many persons as possible.
τοσαῦτα δὲ εἰπὼν ἀπῆλθεν· οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς προτείναντες τὰς χεῖρας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν διὰ παντὸς ὑπέρμαχον τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν, ταῦτα λέγοντες	Then, after speaking such great threats, he departed. But the priests stretched forth their hands to heaven and called upon the ⌊constant⌋ defender of our nation and were saying these things:
ἐτάχυναν, ἐπελάθοντο τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, οὐχ ὑπέμειναν τὴν βουλὴν αὐτοῦ·	They were quickened. They forgot his works. They did not wait for his counsel.
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καλέσαι τὸν Ἀβειμέλεχ υἱὸν Ἀχιτὼβ καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοὺς ἐν Νόμμα· καὶ παρεγένοντο πάντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.	And the king sent to call for Abimelech son of Ahitub and all his father’s sons, the priests in Nob, and all came to the king.
μουσικὰ ἐν πένθει ἄκαιρος διήγησις, μάστιγες καὶ παιδεία ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ σοφίας.	Music in mourning is like an ill-timed story; whips and discipline are at all times wisdom.
εἰ δέ τινες ἐξαρθέντες ὑπὸ μεγαλαυχίας ὥς φησιν ὁ Πλάτων ἅμα νεότητι καὶ ἀνοίᾳ φλεγόμενοι τὴν ψυχὴν μεθ’ ὕβρεως ἐδέξαντο θεῶν ἐπωνυμίας καὶ ναῶν ἱδρύσεις, βραχὺν ἤνθησεν ἡ δόξα χρόνον, εἶτα κενότητα καὶ ἀλαζονείαν μετ’ ἀσεβείας καὶ παρανομίας προσοφλόντες.	And if some, puffed up with excessive vain-glory (as Plato speaks), having their minds enflamed at once with both youthful blood and folly, have with an unruly extravagancy taken upon them the style of Gods and had temples erected in their honor, yet this opinion of them flourished but for a short season, and they afterwards underwent the blame of great vanity and arrogancy, conjoined with the highest impiety and wickedness
τὸν δὲ φάναι, ἃ μὲν συνῆκα, γενναῖα· οἶμαι δὲ καὶ ἃ μὴ συνῆκα· πλὴν Δηλίου γέ τινος δεῖται κολυμβητοῦ.	but it needs a Delian diver to get to the bottom of it. He took care to exercise his body and kept in good condition.
ἀνθρώπων δὲ ψυχαῖς ἐνταυθοῖ μὲν ὑπὸ σωμάτων καὶ παθῶν περιεχομέναις οὐκ ἔστι μετουσία τοῦ θεοῦ, πλὴν ὅσον ὀνείρατος ἀμαυροῦ θιγεῖν νοήσει διὰ φιλοσοφίας·	But men’s souls encompassed here with bodies and passions, have no communication with God, except what they can reach to in conception only, by means of philosophy, as by a kind of an obscure dream.
καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνήν, λέγοντες, Ἰησοῦ, ἐπιστάτα, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς.	And they lifted up their voices and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
καὶ τηλικαῦθ’ ὑφ’ ὑμῶν εὖ πεπονθότες οἱ Χαλκιδεῖς οὐ τὰς ὁμοίας ὑμῖν ἀπέδοσαν, ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ διέβητε εἰς Εὔβοιαν Πλουτάρχῳ βοηθήσοντες, τοὺς μὲν πρώτους χρόνους ἀλλ’ οὖν προσεποιοῦνθ’ ὑμῖν εἶναι φίλοι, ἐπειδὴ δὲ τάχιστα εἰς Ταμύνας παρήλθομεν, καὶ τὸ Κοτύλαιον ὀνομαζόμενον ὄρος ὑπερεβάλομεν, ἐνταῦθα Καλλίας ὁ Χαλκιδεύς, ὃν Δημοσθένης μισθαρνῶν ἐνεκωμίαζεν,	After receiving such benefits at your hands, the Chalcidians did not requite you with like treatment, but as soon as you had crossed over to Euboea to help Plutarchus, while at first they did pretend to be friends to you, yet as soon as we had come to Tamynae and had crossed the mountain called Cotylaeum, then Callias the Chalcidian, who had been the object of Demosthenes' hired praises,
ἀπὸ δὲ θεσφάτων τίς ἀγαθὰ φάτις βροτοῖς τέλλεται;	but from prophecies what word of good ever comes to mortals?
ὃ δὴ ἔγωγε καὶ ἀγανακτῶ, εἰ ταύτῃ τῇ ἐλπίδι εἰς ὑμᾶς ἥκει πιστεύων, ὥσπερ ἄλλων μέν τινων ὄντων τῶν ἠδικημένων, ἑτέρων δὲ τῶν ταῦτα διαψηφιουμένων, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἀμφότερα τῶν αὐτῶν καὶ πεπονθότων καὶ ἀκουσομένων.	Well, for my part I am quite indignant that he should come before you in the confidence of this hope, as though the persons whom he had wronged were different and distinct from those who are to give their verdict on these matters, and as though it were not the same people that have been his victims and are also to be his hearers. It is yourselves who are responsible for this
καὶ ἔστη ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν τεθνηκότων καὶ τῶν ζώντων, καὶ ἐκόπασεν ἡ θραῦσις ἐν τῷ λαῷ.	And he stood among the dead and the living, and the plague stopped among the people.
καὶ εἶδον οἱ ἄνδρες Ἀζώτου ὅτι οὕτως, καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι Οὐ καθήσεται κιβωτὸς τοῦ θεοῦ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν, ὅτι σκληρὰ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ Δαγὼν θεὸν ἡμῶν.	And the men of Ashdod saw that it was so and said, “The ark of God cannot stay with us because his hand is hard upon us and upon Dagon, our god.”
κἀκεῖνον ἐκφερέτω τις ὡς ἐπὶ τὴν τέχνην, ἵν᾽ ἴδωσιν αὐτὸν οἷς ἐλωβᾶθ᾽ οἱ ξένοι.	let him go sell his sausages in full view of the foreigners, whom he used formerly to insult so wantonly.
ταύτης ἕδνα τῶν γάμων βοῦς ὁ Νηλεὺς ᾔτει τὰς Ἰφίκλου.	As her bride-price Neleus asked for the oxen of Iphiclus.
τῇ δὲ σορῷ περιπεσεῖν καὶ κωκῦσαι τηλικοῦτον, ὥστε τῶν παίδων τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν νεώτερον ἐκθανεῖν, τὸν δὲ πρεσβύτερον μεθ’ ἑαυτῆς ἔχουσαν καὶ τὴν σορὸν εἰς πλοῖον ἐνθεμένην ἀναχθῆναι.	but she, having the elder in her own possession, took both him and the ark, and carried them on shipboard, and so took sail.
Καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν τοὺς γραμματεῖς, Τί συζητεῖτε πρὸς αὐτούς;	And He asked the scribes, "What are you discussing with them?"
ὁ δὲ καὶ τὴν ἀδελφὴν τῆς γαμηθείσης ἐπεχείρησε βιάζεσθαι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο φυγαδευθεὶς μετὰ Ἰσμάρου τοῦ παιδὸς πρὸς Τεγύριον ἧκε, Θρᾳκῶν βασιλέα, ὃς αὐτοῦ τῷ παιδὶ τὴν θυγατέρα συνῴκισεν.	But he tried to force his wife's sister, and being banished on that account, he went with his son Ismarus to Tegyrius, king of Thrace, who gave his daughter in marriage to Eumolpus's son.
τὸν οὖν Σωκράτη ἀκούσαντα πάλιν τε κελεῦσαι τὴν πρώτην ὑπόθεσιν τοῦ πρώτου λόγου ἀναγνῶναι, καὶ ἀναγνωσθείσης, πῶς, φάναι, ὦ Ζήνων, τοῦτο λέγεις; εἰ πολλά ἐστι τὰ ὄντα, ὡς ἄρα δεῖ αὐτὰ ὅμοιά τε εἶναι καὶ ἀνόμοια, τοῦτο δὲ δὴ ἀδύνατον·	Socrates listened to the end, and then asked that the first thesis of the first treatise be read again. When this had been done, he said Zeno, what do you mean by this?
οἶδα δὲ καὶ ὑπὸ Ἰώνων, ὁπότε ἴδοιέν τινα πονοῦντα ἐπὶ οὐδενὶ ὄνησιν φέροντι, ὑπὸ τούτων εἰρημένον ὡς ὁ ἀνὴρ οὗτος συνάγει τοῦ Ὄκνου τὴν θώμιγγα.	I know also that the Ionians, whenever they see a man labouring at nothing profitable, say that such an one is plaiting the cord of Ocnus.
Καθήμενος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου καὶ δοξάζων τὸν κύριον περὶ πάντων ὧν ἑωράκειν καὶ συζητῶν περὶ τῶν ἐντολῶν, ὅτι καλαὶ καὶ δυναταὶ καὶ ἱλαραὶ καὶ ἔνδοξοι καὶ δυνάμεναι σῶσαι ψυχὴν ἀνθρώπου, ἔλεγον ἐν ἐμαυτῷ:	While I was seated in my house, and was glorifying the Lord for all that I had seen, and enquiring about the commandments because they were beautiful and joyful and glorious, and able to save the soul, of man, I said in myself
ἥ τε γὰρ χώρα σχολάζειν ἔμελλε, καὶ πολὺν πόλεμον ἐκ Λιβύης προσεδέχοντο, πυνθανόμενοι τοὺς Καρχηδονίους τοῦ μὲν Μάγωνος ἑαυτὸν ἀνελόντος ἀνεσταυρωκέναι τὸ σῶμα διὰ τὴν στρατηγίαν ὀργισθέντας, αὐτοὺς δὲ συνάγειν μεγάλην δύναμιν ὡς ἔτους ὥρᾳ διαβησομένους εἰς Σικελίαν.	For otherwise the land was likely to lie uncultivated, and they expected a great war from Africa, since they learned that the Carthaginians, after Mago’s suicide, had impaled his dead body, in their rage at his conduct of the expedition, and that they were assembling a great force with the intention of crossing into Sicily in the summer.
νῦν δ’ ἐν αἱμακουρίαις ἀγλααῖσι μέμικται, Ἀλφεοῦ πόρῳ κλιθείς, τύμβον ἀμφίπολον ἔχων πολυξενωτάτῳ παρὰ βωμῷ.	Now he has a share in splendid blood-sacrifices, resting beside the ford of the Alpheus, where he has his attendant tomb beside the altar that is thronged with many visitors.
κἄν τινα ἀποχειροτονήσωσιν, κρίνουσιν ἐν τῷ δικαστηρίῳ, κἂν μὲν ἁλῷ, τιμῶσιν ὅ τι χρὴ παθεῖν ἢ ἀποτεῖσαι, ἂν δ᾽ ἀποφύγῃ, πάλιν ἄρχει.	and if this vote goes against any officer he is tried in the jury - court, and if convicted, the penalty or fine to be imposed on him is assessed, but if he is acquitted he resumes office.
ἐλθόντος δὲ Περικλέους πάλιν ταῖς ναυσὶ κατεκλῄσθησαν.	But on the arrival of Pericles they were once more shut up.
τὸ δὲ ὄνομα λέγουσι τῇ χώρᾳ Νεμέαν δοῦναι θυγατέρα Ἀσωποῦ καὶ ταύτην.	The land was named, they say, after Nemea, who was another daughter of Asopus.
νομίσαντες δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ συνοδίᾳ εἶναι, ἦλθον ἡμέρας ὁδόν, καὶ ἀνεζήτουν αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς συγγενέσιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς γνωστοῖς·	but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
Καὶ τοῖς Λευείταις λαλήσεις καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς Ἐὰν λάβητε παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τὸ ἐπιδέκατον ὃ δέδωκα ὑμῖν παρ᾽ αὐτῶν ἐν κλήρῳ, καὶ ἀφελεῖτε ὑμεῖς ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίῳ ἐπιδέκατον ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐπιδεκάτου.	“And you will speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘Whenever you receive the tithe from the children of Israel, which I have given to you from them as a share, then you yourselves will separate out from it a portion to the Lord, a tithe of the tithe.
καὶ ἔτυχεν ἡμῶν ἡ φυλὴ Ἀντιοχὶς πρυτανεύουσα ὅτε ὑμεῖς τοὺς δέκα στρατηγοὺς τοὺς οὐκ ἀνελομένους τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ναυμαχίας ἐβουλεύσασθε ἁθρόους κρίνειν, παρανόμως, ὡς ἐν τῷ ὑστέρῳ χρόνῳ πᾶσιν ὑμῖν ἔδοξεν.	and it happened that my tribe held the presidency when you wished to judge collectively, not severally, the ten generals who had failed to gather up the slain after the naval battle
καὶ εἶπεν Χουσεὶ πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλώμ Οὐκ ἀγαθὴ αὕτη ἡ βουλὴ ἣν ἐβουλεύσατο Ἀχειτόφελ τὸ ἅπαξ τοῦτο.	And Hushai said to Absalom, “It is not good, this counsel that Ahithophel has given this one time.”
καὶ τὸ ζητεῖν ἡμῖν καὶ εὔχεσθαι πολλοὺς φίλους, ἅμα δὲ λέγειν ὡς οὐθεὶς φίλος ᾧ πολλοὶ φίλοι, ἄμφω λέγεται ὀρθῶς.	As to seeking for ourselves and praying for many friends, and at the same time saying that one who has many friends has no friend, both statements are correct.
Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται τοῦ κυρίου, καὶ διαμερισθήσεται τὰ σκῦλά σου ἐν σοί·	Behold, the days of the Lord are coming, and your spoils will be divided among you.
εἷς μέν γε Νεοκλείδης, ὅς ἐστι μὲν τυφλός, κλέπτων δὲ τοὺς βλέποντας ὑπερηκόντικεν·	yes. firstly, neoclides, who is blind, but steals much better than those who see clearly;
πράττοντας, φαμέν, ἀνθρώπους μιμεῖται ἡ μιμητικὴ βιαίους ἢ ἑκουσίας πράξεις, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ πράττειν ἢ εὖ οἰομένους ἢ κακῶς πεπραγέναι, καὶ ἐν τούτοις δὴ πᾶσιν ἢ λυπουμένους ἢ χαίροντας.	Mimetic poetry, we say, imitates human beings acting under compulsion or voluntarily, and as a result of their actions supposing themselves to have fared well or ill and in all this feeling either grief or joy.
ἐβούλετο μὲν οὖν ἴσον ἔχειν τιμῆς καὶ παρέχειν ὁ Κάσσιος, ἔφθανε δ’ ὁ Βροῦτος ὡς τὰ πολλὰ φοιτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν ἡλικίᾳ τε προὔχοντα καὶ σώματι πονεῖν ὁμοίως μὴ δυναμένῳ χρώμενον.	Now, Cassius was desirous that Brutus and he should have equal honour, but Brutus forestalled this by coming to him generally, since he was an older man and unable to endure the same amount of hardship.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλεισαῖε Ἄκουσον λόγον Κυρίου Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὕτη αὔριον, μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου ἐν ταῖς πύλαις Σαμαρείας.	Elisha said, “Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: ‘About this time tomorrow, a measure of flour will be sold for a shekel in the gates of Samaria.’ ”
κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὅρασιν ταύτην, οὕτως ἐλάλησεν Ναθὰν πρὸς Δαυείδ.	According to all these words and according to this entire vision, this is what Nathan said to David.
λοιδορεῖσθαι δ᾽ οὐ πρέπει ἄνδρας ποιητὰς ὥσπερ ἀρτοπώλιδας.	it's just not proper for poets to abuse each other like fishwives.
ἡ γὰρ ὄντως οὖσα σοφία ταύτῃ πῃ φαίνεται τῷ καὶ σμικρὰ συννοίας ὀρθῆς θείας τε μετειληφότι.	For real wisdom shows herself in some such way as this to him who has got even a little share of right and divine meditation.
πυθόμενος δὲ Καῖσαρ, καὶ τοῦ φθόνου μᾶλλον Ἄρειον ἢ τοῦ δέους Φιλόστρατον ἀπαλλάξαι βουλόμενος, διῆκε.	When Caesar learned of this, he pardoned him, wishing rather to free Areius from odium than Philostratus from fear.
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἕτερόν ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ὁρισμῷ πλὴν τὸ πρῶτον λεγόμενον γένος καὶ αἱ διαφοραί· τὰ δ᾽ ἄλλα γένη ἐστὶ τό τε πρῶτον καὶ μετὰ τούτου αἱ συλλαμβανόμεναι διαφοραί, οἷον τὸ πρῶτον ζῷον, τὸ δὲ ἐχόμενον ζῷον δίπουν, καὶ πάλιν ζῷον δίπουν ἄπτερον·	thus such parts as are material, and into which the whole is resolved as into matter, are posterior to the whole; but such as are parts in the sense of parts of the formula and of the essence as expressed in the formula, are prior; either all or some of them. and since the soul of animals ( which is the substance of the living creature ) is their substance in accordance with the formula, and the form and essence of that particular kind of body ( at least each part, if
τῷ δ᾽ ἐναντίῳ κύτει ἐλπὶς προσῄει χειρὸς οὐ πληρουμένῳ. καπνῷ δ᾽ ἁλοῦσα νῦν ἔτ᾽ εὔσημος πόλις.	filled it was not. by smoke the captured city is still conspicuous:
διὸ τὴν σελήνην οὐκ ἄγει τὸ βάρος, ὑπὸ τῆς περιφορᾶς τὴν ῥοπὴν ἐκκρουόμενον.	Wherefore the moon does not move according to the motion of her weight, her inclination being stopped and hindered by the violence of a circular revolution.
καὶ εἶπεν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ Εἴπατε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντι ὑμᾶς πρὸς μέ	She said, “This is what the Lord the God of Israel says: ‘Speak to the man who sent you to me.
ἐν δὲ τῇ πορείᾳ παρακελεύεσθαί με φησὶν αὑτῷ, ὅπως τὸ θηρίον κοινῇ φυλάξομεν, τὸν Φιλοκράτην, πρᾶγμα λέγων πεπλασμένον.	And he asserts that on the journey I urged him to join me in guarding against the beast—meaning Philocrates. But the whole story was a fabrication
ἦν δὲ ἐν τῇ γραφῇ, ὡς τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν ἐκέλευσεν ὁ προφήτης χρηματισμοῦ γενηθέντος αὐτῷ συνακολουθεῖν, ὡς δὲ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος οὗ ὁ Μωυσῆς ἀναβὰς ἐθεάσατο τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ κληρονομίαν.	And it stands in the written report that the prophet ordered the tabernacle and the ark to accompany them, an oracle being received by him, and that he went out to the mountain from which Moses, upon ascending, beheld the inheritance of God.
ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἄπειμι γῆς ὑπὸ ζόφον κάτω.	as for me, I depart to the darkness beneath the earth.
εὗρον δὲ ἑκάστου τῶν τεθνηκότων ὑπὸ τοὺς χιτῶνας ἱερώματα τῶν ἀπὸ Ἰαμνίας εἰδώλων, ἀφ᾽ ὧν ὁ νόμος ἀπήργει τοὺς Ἰουδαίους· τοῖς δὲ πᾶσι σαφὲς ἐγένετο διὰ τήνδε τὴν αἰτίαν τούσδε πεπτωκέναι.	But they discovered under the shirts of each of those who died amulets of the idols from Jamnia. The law kept the Judeans away from these. And it became clear to everyone that on account of this reason these men had fallen.
καὶ εἶδον ἀετὸν κατελθόντα ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἁρπάσαντα ἀπ’ ἔμπροσθεν ἐμοῦ τε καὶ τοῦ βασιλέως δύο πέρδικας, οὓς εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ καρδίαν·	and I saw an eagle come down from heaven and carry off from before me and the king two partridges, which he set against his heart
ἐγὼ δὲ προσδοκῶν γε τρισμυριόπαλαι βδελύττομαί σφω καὶ προπαλαιπαλαίπαλαι.	very long, infinitely long, long, long that i have cursed you.
τοὺς μὲν γὰρ ἄλλους συνοίκους ἔχειν ἐν τῇ πόλει τοὺς στασιάσαντας καὶ κοινωνοὺς ἁπάντων πλὴν τῶν ἀρχῶν καὶ τῶν τιμῶν· οὓς οὐκ εὖ φρονεῖν ἡγεῖσθαι Σπαρτιατῶν τοὺς νοῦν ἔχοντας, εἰ νομίζουσιν ἀσφαλῶς πολιτεύεσθαι μετὰ τούτων οἰκοῦντες, περὶ οὓς τὰ μέγιστα τυγχάνουσιν ἐξημαρτηκότες·	For the latter suffered the opposing party to live with them and share in all the privileges of the state, excepting the offices and the honors, whereas the intelligent class among the Spartans held that such men were foolish in thinking that they could live in the same city with those against whom they had committed the greatest wrongs and yet govern the state in security
οἶδε μὲν γὰρ οὐδεὶς τὸν θάνατον οὐδ’ εἰ τυγχάνει τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ πάντων μέγιστον ὂν τῶν ἀγαθῶν, δεδίασι δ’ ὡς εὖ εἰδότες ὅτι μέγιστον τῶν κακῶν ἐστι.	For no one knows whether death be not even the greatest of all blessings to man, but they fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.
ἐπεὶ οὖν ἐν αἷς μὲν αὐτὰ φέρεται σφαίραις αἱ μὲν ὀκτὼ αἱ δὲ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσίν εἰσιν, τούτων δὲ μόνας οὐ δεῖ ἀνελιχθῆναι ἐν αἷς τὸ κατωτάτω τεταγμένον φέρεται, αἱ μὲν τὰς τῶν πρώτων δύο ἀνελίττουσαι ἓξ ἔσονται, αἱ δὲ τὰς τῶν ὕστερον τεττάρων ἑκκαίδεκα·	therefore since the forces by which the planets themselves are moved are 8 for jupiter and saturn, and 25 for the others, and since of these the only ones which do not need to be counteracted are those by which the lowest planet is moved, the counteracting spheres for the first two planets will be 6, and those of the remaining four will be 16;
εἴ τις αὐτὸν ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἔχει, νοησάτω ὃ θέλω, καὶ συμπαθείτω μοι εἰδὼς τὰ συνέχοντά με.	If any man have him within himself, let him understand what I wish, and let him sympathise with me, knowing the things which constrain me.
καμνόντων δὲ λόγου μειζόνως τῶν Κελτῶν καὶ ἅτε ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ μικρὰ μὲν δρώντων, διπλάσια δὲ καὶ τετραπλάσια πασχόντων, ἀναχωρεῖν ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐσήμαινόν σφισιν οἱ ἡγεμόνες.	The Celts were in unspeakable distress, and as in the confined space they inflicted few losses but suffered twice or four times as many, their captains gave the signal to retire to their camp.
Ἦν δέ τις ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Λευεὶ ὃς ἔλαβεν τῶν θυγατέρων Λευεί.	And there was a certain man from the tribe of Levi who took one of the daughters of Levi.
Καὶ ὑπέστρεψαν οἱ ποιμένες, δοξάζοντες καὶ αἰνοῦντες τὸν θεὸν ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἷς ἤκουσαν καὶ εἶδον, καθὼς ἐλαλήθη πρὸς αὐτούς.	Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.
ὅταν δέ τις τὸ μὲν ἀπολίπῃ, τὸ δὲ ἐκβάλῃ ὁμοίως σύμφωνον ὂν τῷ φαινομένῳ, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ ἐκ παντὸς ἐκπίπτει φυσιολογήματος ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν μῦθον καταρρεῖ.	But when we pick and choose among them, rejecting one equally consistent with the phenomena, we clearly fall away from the study of nature altogether and tumble into myth.
τότε μὲν ταῦτ’ ἐκήρυττεν,	and he would utter that proclamation so honorable and so incentive to valor “These young men, whose fathers showed themselves brave men and died in war, have been supported by the state until they have come of age and now, clad thus in full armour by their fellow citizens, they are sent out with the prayers of the city, to go each his way and they are invited to seats of honor in the theater.”
ἐν δὲ Μαντινείᾳ οἱ δημιουργοὶ καὶ ἡ βουλὴ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαί, ἐξορκούντων δὲ οἱ θεωροὶ καὶ οἱ πολέμαρχοι·	at Mantinea by the Demiurgi, the Senate, and the other magistrates, the Theori and Polemarchs administering it
δαῖμον, ὃς ἐμπίτνεις δώμασι καὶ διφυί - οισι Τανταλίδαισιν, κράτος τ᾽ ἰσόψυχον ἐκ γυναικῶν καρδιόδηκτον ἐμοὶ κρατύνεις.	daimon, who fallest upon this household and the double - raced tantalidai, a rule, minded like theirs displaced, thou rulest me with, now, whose heart thou gallest!
Ὀδυσσέα πλανώμενον μετὰ ἅλωσιν τὴν Ἰλίου κατενεχθῆναί φασιν ὑπὸ ἀνέμων ἔς τε ἄλλας τῶν ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ καὶ Σικελίᾳ πόλεων, ἀφικέσθαι δὲ καὶ ἐς Τεμέσαν ὁμοῦ ταῖς ναυσί·	Odysseus, so they say, in his wanderings after the capture of Troy was carried down by gales to various cities of Italy and Sicily, and among them he came with his ships to Temesa.
καὶ καταβήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν θρόνων αὐτῶν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀφελοῦνται τὰς μίτρας ἀπὸ τῶν κεφαλῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν τὸν ποικίλον αὐτῶν ἐκδύσονται· ἐκστάσει ἐκστήσονται, ἐπὶ γῆν καθεδοῦνται καὶ φοβηθήσονται τὴν ἀπωλίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ στενάξουσιν ἐπὶ σέ·	And all the rulers from the nations of the sea will step down from their thrones, and remove the headdresses from their heads, and take off their many-colored clothing. They will be amazed with amazement; they will sit down on the earth, and they will be frightened by their destruction, and they will sigh over you.
Ἀιδωνεὺς δ᾽ ἀναπομ - πὸς ἀνείης, Ἀιδωνεύς, θεῖον ἀνάκτορα Δαριᾶνα.	o aidoneus, aidoneus, who convey shades to the upper air, permit our divine lord darius to come forth!

ἐς ταύτην λέγουσιν ὑδρευομένην ἐσπεσεῖν παρθένον, ἀφανισθείσης δὲ τὸ κάλυμμα ἀναφανῆναι τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἐν ἑτέρᾳ πηγῇ Λαγκίᾳ.	Into it they say a maiden fell when she was drawing water, and when she had disappeared the veil on her head reappeared in another spring, Lancia.
τῶν δὲ παίδων Τῶν τρισμυρίων, οὓς ἀσκουμένους καὶ μανθάνοντας ἀπέλιπε, τοῖς τε σώμασιν ἀνδρείων φανέντων καὶ τοῖς εἴδεσιν εὐπρεπῶν, ἔτι δὲ καὶ ταῖς μελέταις εὐχέρειαν καὶ κουφότητα θαυμαστὴν ἐπιδειξαμένων, αὐτὸς μὲν ἥσθη, τοῖς δὲ Μακεδόσι δυσθυμία παρέστη καὶ δέος, ὡς ἧττον αὐτοῖς τοῦ βασιλέως προσέξοντος.	The thirty thousand boys whom he had left behind him under instruction and training were now so vigorous in their bodies and so comely in their looks, and showed besides such admirable dexterity and agility in their exercises, that Alexander himself was delighted; his Macedonians, however, were filled with dejection and fear, thinking that their king would now pay less regard to them.
τοῦτο δ’ ἐστὶν ἱερωσύνης εἶδος, ᾧ μάλιστα τὴν ἀπ’ οἰωνῶν μαντικὴν ἐπιβλέπειν καὶ παραφυλάττειν νόμος δέδωκεν.	This is a species of priesthood, to which the law particularly assigns the observation and study of prophetic signs from the flight of birds.
ἐξελυσάμην βροτοὺς τὸ μὴ διαρραισθέντας εἰς Ἅιδου μολεῖν.	i saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of hades.

οὐ μόνον τοίνυν διετρίψαμεν τὰς λοιπὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ μηνός, ἀλλὰ Μουνιχιῶνος ἐξωρμήσαμεν. καὶ τούτου τὴν βουλὴν μάρτυρα ὑμῖν παρέξομαι· ἔστι γὰρ αὐτῆς ψήφισμα, ὃ κελεύει ἀπιέναι τοὺς πρέσβεις ἐπὶ τοὺς ὅρκους. καί μοι λέγε τὸ τῆς βουλῆς ψήφισμα.Ψήφισμαπαρανάγνωθι δὴ καὶ τὸν χρόνον, ὅστις ἦν.Χρόνος	Now not only did we delay all the rest of that month, but it was Munichion when we set out. As witness of this I will present the senate, for there is a decree of theirs which commands the ambassadors to set out in order to receive the oaths. Please read the decree of the senate.DecreeNow read also the date of the decree.Date
Πᾶς ὁ μισῶν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἀνθρωποκτόνος ἐστίν· καὶ οἴδατε ὅτι πᾶς ἀνθρωποκτόνος οὐκ ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον ἐν ἑαυτῷ μένουσαν.	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
Τότε ἀνέβη Ἁζαὴλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐπὶ Γέθ, καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτήν. καὶ ἔταξεν Ἁζαὴλ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀναβῆναι ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ.	Then Hazael, king of Aram, came up and made war at Gath. He seized it. Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
ἀπωσαμένου δὲ Νηλέως αὐτὸν διὰ τὴν πρὸς Εὔρυτον φιλίαν, εἰς Ἀμύκλας παραγενόμενος ὑπὸ Δηιφόβου τοῦ Ἱππολύτου καθαίρεται.	And when Neleus rejected his request on the score of his friendship with Eurytus, he went to Amyclae and was purified by Deiphobus, son of Hippolytus.
ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Οὐχ οὕτως ἰσχυρὸς ὑμῶν ἐστιν ὁ τρόπος, ὦ μιεροὶ διάκονοι, ὥστε μου τὸν λογισμὸν ἄξαι. τέμνετέ μου μέλη, καὶ πυροῦτε τὰς σάρκας, καὶ στρεβλοῦτε τὰ ἄρθρα·	He said, “Your way is not mighty in such a way, O depraved servants, so as to break my reason! Cut off my arms and legs! And burn up flesh! And twist my limbs out of joint!
Εὐθέως δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα ἐπελάβετο αὐτοῦ, καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Ὀλιγόπιστε, εἰς τί ἐδίστασας;	And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
ἐκείνων δὲ καταγιγνώσκομεν ὡς καὶ τοὺς ἐξ αὑτῶν γεγονότας περιεῖδον οὕτως ἀσεβεῖς καὶ παρανόμους ὄντας.	yet we condemn the gods by believing that they permitted their own offspring to be so impious and lawless.
ἔστι γὰρ δένδρον πεφυκὸς ἔκτοπόν τι Καρδίας ἀ - πωτέρω Κλεώνυμος, χρήσιμον μὲν οὐδέν, ἄλλως δὲ δειλὸν καὶ μέγα. τοῦτο τοῦ μὲν ἦρος ἀεὶ βλαστάνει καὶ συκοφαντεῖ, τοῦ δὲ χειμῶνος πάλιν τὰς ἀσπίδας φυλλορροεῖ.	there is a tree called cleonymus belonging to an unknown species; it has no heart, is good for nothing and is as tall as it is cowardly. in springtime it shoots forth calumnies instead of buds and in autumn it strews the ground with bucklers in place of leaves.
οἱ Στωικοὶ ἐξ ὀκτὼ μερῶν φασι συνεστάναι, πέντε μὲν τῶν αἰσθητικῶν, ὁρατικοῦ ἀκουστικοῦ ὀσφρητικοῦ γευστικοῦ ἁπτικοῦ, ἕκτου δὲ φωνητικοῦ, ἑβδόμου δὲ σπερματικοῦ, ὀγδόου δ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ, ἀφ’ οὗ ταῦτα πάντα ἐπιτέταται διὰ τῶν οἰκείων ὀργάνων προσφερῶς ταῖς τοῦ πολύποδος πλεκτάναις.	they divide the unreasonable part into the concupiscible and the irascible. The Stoics say the soul is constituted of eight parts five of which are the senses, hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling, the sixth is the faculty of speaking, the seventh of generating, the eighth of commanding this is the principal of all, by which all the other are guided and ordered in their proper organs, as we see the arms of a polypus aptly disposed.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ Προσθείη Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ὡς αὐτοὶ ἑκατονταπλασίως, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως βλέποντες· πάντες τῷ κυρίῳ μου παῖδες· ἵνα τί ζητεῖ κύριός μου τοῦτο; ἵνα μὴ γένηται εἰς ἁμαρτίαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.	Joab said, “May the Lord add to his people a hundred times as much as they are, and may the eyes of my Lord, the king, see all the servants of my Lord, for why does my master seek this?” ⌊He said this lest⌋ it become sin to Israel.
Ταπεινώθητε ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου, καὶ ὑψώσει ὑμᾶς.	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.
οὕτως καὶ τὰ πολλαπλάσια λέγεται·	the divisible, is more easily perceptible than the indivisible;
τὸ δ’ ἄλλο τὸ μετρίως παχὺ σὺν τῷ κατειργάσθαι πάντη φέρεται.	the other part which is only moderately thick, after being elaborated [in the liver], is carried all over the body.
ἀλλὰ περὶ τὰ δύο τῶν αἰσθητῶν ταῦτα, περὶ ἅπερ καὶ τἆλλα θηρία μόνον τυγχάνει αἰσθητικῶς ἔχοντα, καὶ χαίροντα καὶ λυπούμενα, περὶ τὰ γευστὰ καὶ ἁπτά. περὶ δὲ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων αἰσθητῶν ἡδέα σχεδὸν ὁμοίως ἅπαντα φαίνεται ἀναισθήτως διακείμενα, οἷον περὶ εὐαρμοστίαν ἢ κάλλος.	temperance and profligacy have to do with those two sorts of sensory objects in relation to which alone the lower animals also happen to be sensitive and to feel pleasure and pain - the objects of taste and of touch, whereas about virtually all the pleasures of the other senses alike animals are clearly so constituted as to be insensitive - e. g. harmonious sound, or beauty;
οὐ γὰρ ἐγὼ κρατῶ τῆς τύχης, ἀλλ’ ἡ τύχη τοῦ βίου, δι’ ἣν κινδυνεύει.	it is Fortune which controls life and gives it its danger.
Ζητήσωμεν δέ, εἰ ἐμέλησεν τῷ κυρίῳ προφανερῶσαι περὶ τοῦ ὕδατος καὶ περὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ.	But let us enquire if the Lord took pains to foretell the water of baptism and the cross.
τὸν δὲ ἀνδριάντα ἐποίησε Σικυώνιος Κάνθαρος, Ἀλέξιδος μὲν πατρός, διδασκάλου δὲ ὢν Εὐτυχίδου.	The statue was made by Cantharus of Sicyon, whose father was Alexis, while his teacher was Eutychides.
οὔτε γὰρ τῶν χρησίμων δεῖσθαι αὐτάρκους οὔτε τῶν εὐφρανούντων οὔτε τοῦ συζῆν· αὐτὸς γὰρ αὑτῷ ἱκανὸς συνεῖναι.	for it does not belong to the self - sufficing man to need either useful friends or friends to amuse him and society, for he is sufficient society for himself.
ὅταν δὲ γράψωσιν, ἀφελόντες τὸ βιβλίον ἄνευ τοῦ ξύλου πρὸς τὸν στρατηγὸν ἀποστέλλουσι.	and when they have written their message, they take the parchment off and send it, without the piece of wood, to the commander.
πρὸς ὃ δεῖ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀποβλέποντας μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τοῖς ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος λέγουσιν·	Let it be your pattern, and, like it, do not give way to speakers who digress from the point.
ἐνταῦθα ἑκατέρα τῶν πιτύων τὸν δεθέντα ἐφ’ αὑτὴν εἷλκε, καὶ τοῦ δεσμοῦ μηδετέρωσε εἴκοντος ἀλλ’ ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐπ’ ἴσης βιαζομένου διεσπᾶτο ὁ δεδεμένος.

καὶ τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις πᾶσιν, ὁπηνίκα διεσκοποῦντο τὴν πρᾶξιν, ἤρεσκεν Ἀντώνιον ἐπισφάττειν Καίσαρι, μοναρχικὸν ἄνδρα καὶ ὑβριστὴν, ἰσχύν τε πεποιημένον ὁμιλίᾳ καὶ συνηθείᾳ πρὸς τὸ στρατιωτικόν, καὶ μάλισθ’ ὅτι τῷ φύσει σοβαρῷ καὶ μεγαλοπράγμονι προσειλήφει τὸ τῆς ὑπατείας ἀξίωμα τότε Καίσαρι συνάρχων.	All the rest of the conspirators, indeed, when they were discussing their enterprise, had been minded to kill Antony as well as Caesar, since he was a lawless man and in favour of a monarchy, and had acquired strength by familiar association with the soldiery; and particularly because to his natural arrogance and ambition he had added the dignity of the consulship, and was at that time a colleague of Caesar.
ἀλλ’ εἴ σοι εἶπεν· ὦ Θρασύμαχε, πῶς λέγεις;	Suppose he had said to you, Thrasymachus, what do you mean?
καὶ ὁ ποιῶν ἐλεημοσύνην θυσιάζων αἰνέσεως.	and the one who gives alms is one who offers a sacrifice of praise.

καὶ ἔσται ἡ χώρα τῶν Ἰουδαίων τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις εἰς φόβηθρον· πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν ὀνομάσῃ αὐτὴν αὐτοῖς, φοβηθήσονται διὰ τὴν βουλὴν ἣν βεβούλευται Κύριος ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν.	And the region of the Judeans will be a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone who mentions it to them, they will be frightened because of the plan that the Lord has planned against it.
Ἀρίστων δὲ ἐπῶν τῶν ἐν Ἰλιάδι ἐς τὴν Εὐρυσθέως γένεσιν πεποιημένος λήθην ἢ μηδὲ ἀρχὴν συνεὶς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔφη τῶν μηνῶν ἕνεκα αὑτοῦ τὸν παῖδα εἶναι.	Ariston, forgetting the lines in the Iliad about the birth of Eurystheus, or else never having understood them at all, declared that because of the number of months the child was not his.
οἰκονομίαι δέ εἰσι τέσσαρες, ὡς ἐν τύπῳ διελέσθαι τὰς γὰρ ἄλλας εἰς τοῦτο ἐμπιπτούσας εὑρήσομεν, βασιλική σατραπική πολιτική ἰδιωτική.	of such administrations there are four main types, under which all others may be classified. we have the administration of a king; of the governors under him; of a free state; and of a private citizen.
ἑκόντα μὲν οὖν οὐκ ἐπικαλῶ ἀποκτεῖναι, ἄκοντα δέ. ἐμοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἐλάσσω τοῦ ἑκόντος ἄκων τὴν συμφορὰν κατέστησε.	i accuse him not of killing my son deliberately, but of killing him by accident - though the loss which i have suffered is not thereby lessened.
καὶ ὑπὸ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τοῦ θέρους τελευτῶντος Ῥαμφίας καὶ Αὐτοχαρίδας καὶ Ἐπικυδίδας Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία βοήθειαν ἦγον ἐνακοσίων ὁπλιτῶν, καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Ἡράκλειαν τὴν ἐν Τραχῖνι καθίσταντο ὅτι αὐτοῖς ἐδόκει μὴ καλῶς ἔχειν.	About the same time three Lacedaemonians—Ramphias, Autocharidas, and Epicydidas—led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry to the towns in the direction of Thrace, and arriving at Heraclea in Trachis reformed matters there as seemed good to them.
καὶ οὐ τοῦτο μόνον αὐτῶν ἀπέλαυσε τῆς πλεονεξίας Λούκουλλος, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ἀπορρήτων τοῦ βασιλέως ὄντα Καλλίστρατον ὁ μὲν ἄγειν ἐκέλευσεν, οἱ δ’ ἄγοντες αἰσθόμενοι πεντακοσίους χρυσοῦς ὑπεζωσμένον ἀπέκτειναν. οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ τούτοις μὲν ἐπέτρεψε τὸν χάρακα πορθῆσαι.	Nor was this the only fruit of their greed which Lucullus reaped. He had given orders that Callistratus, who was in charge of the king’s private papers, should be brought alive to him, but his conductors, finding that he had five hundred pieces of gold in his girdle, slew him. However, Lucullus allowed such soldiers as these to plunder the enemy’s camp.
οἳ δ’ ἐξαπίνης ἐφάνησαν ξουθῇσι πτερύγεσσι δι’ αἰθέρος ἀίξαντες, αὐτίκα δ’ ἀργαλέων ἀνέμων κατέπαυσαν ἀέλλας, κύματα δ’ ἐστόρεσαν λευκῆς ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσι, σήματα καλά, πόνου ἀπονόσφισιν·	Forthwith they allay the blasts of the cruel winds and still the waves upon the surface of the white sea fair signs are they and deliverance from toil.
δηλώσει δέ σοι Ἀρχέδημος, ἐπειδὰν ἔλθῃ.	and Archedemus will point it out to you when he arrives.
ἐπιστὰς γὰρ ἐπὶ τὰς αὐτὰς διανοίας εἱλόμην μὴ πονεῖν γλιχόμενος τὰ δεδηλωμένα καλῶς ἑτέρως εἰπεῖν·	For, coming to the same thoughts, I have preferred not to go through the effort of striving to phrase differently what has already been well expressed.
ἧττόν τι οὖν οἴει ἡμᾶς εὖ λέγειν τούτου ἕνεκα, ἐὰν μὴ ἔχωμεν ἀποδεῖξαι ὡς δυνατὸν οὕτω πόλιν οἰκῆσαι ὡς ἐλέγετο;	Do you think, then, that our words are any the less well spoken if we find ourselves unable to prove that it is possible for a state to be governed in accordance with our words?
τέκνα δὲ μοιχῶν ἀτέλεστα ἔσται, καὶ ἐκ παρανόμου κοίτης σπέρμα ἀφανισθήσεται.	But children of adulterers will be unable to reach maturity, and the seed of unlawful intercourse will perish.
ἐὰν δὲ θυσία ἀπὸ τηγάνου τὸ δῶρόν σου, σεμίδαλις πεφυραμένη ἐν ἐλαίῳ, ἄζυμά ἐστιν·	And when your offering is a sacrifice from a baking tray, it is the finest wheat flour kneaded with olive oil and unleavened.
Καὶ ὡς ἐτελέσθη ταῦτα, ἤγγισαν πρὸς μὲ οἱ ἄρχοντες λέγοντες Οὐκ ἐχωρίσθη ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευεῖται ἀπὸ λαῶν τῶν γαιῶν ἐν μακρύμμασιν αὐτῶν· τῷ Χανανεί, ὁ Ἑθεί, ὁ Φερεσθεί, ὁ Ἰεβουσεί, ὁ Ἀμμωνεί, ὁ Μωάβ, ὁ Μοσερεὶ καὶ ὁ Ἀμορεί·	Now when these things were completed, the rulers approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites were not separated from the peoples of the land with their abominations, in reference to the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonite, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
τὰ δὲ ἐφεξῆς ταύτῃ, τὰ μὲν ἀγάλματα τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος Ἐπιδαύριοι τὸ ἕτερον οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀργολίδι ἀπὸ Μήδων, τὸ δὲ αὐτῶν Μεγαρεῖς ἀνέθεσαν Ἀθηναίους μάχῃ πρὸς Νισαίᾳ κρατήσαντες·	The offerings next to Phryne include two images of Apollo, one dedicated from Persian spoils by the Epidaurians of Argolis, the other dedicated by the Megarians to commemorate a victory over the Athenians at Nisaea.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος τοῖς εὐνούχοις ὅσοι ἐὰν φυλάξωνται τὰ σάββατά μου καὶ ἐκλέξωνται ἃ ἐγὼ θέλω καὶ ἀντέχωνται τῆς διαθήκης μου,	This is what the Lord says to the eunuchs: “As many as should keep my Sabbaths and choose the things that I wish and cleave to my covenant,
τίς ὧδε τλησικάρδιος θεῶν, ὅτῳ τάδ’ ἐπιχαρῆ; τίς οὐ ξυνασχαλᾷ κακοῖς τεοῖσι, δίχα γε Διός; ὁ δ’ ἐπικότως ἀεὶ θέμενος ἄγναμπτον νόον δάμναται Οὐρανίαν γένναν, οὐδὲ λήξει, πρὶν ἂν ἢ κορέσῃ κέαρ ἢ παλάμᾳ τινὶ τὰν δυσάλωτον ἕλῃ τις ἀρχάν.	Who of the gods is so hard of heart as to exult in this? Who does not sympathize with your woes—save only Zeus? But he in malice, has set his soul inflexibly and keeps in subjection the race sprung from Uranus; nor will he stop, until he has satiated his soul or another seizes his impregnable empire by some device of guile.
καὶ ἐὰν ὑπενέγκῃ τὰς θλίψεις τὰς ἐπερχομένας αὐτῷ, πάντως σπλαγχνισθήσεται ὁ τὰ πάντα κτίσας καὶ ἐνδυναμώσας καὶ ἴασίν τινα δώσει αὐτῷ:	And if he endure the afflictions which come upon him he who created all things, and gave them power will have compassion in all ways upon him, and will give him some measure of healing
Πυριλάμπους γὰρ τοῦ σοῦ θείου οὐδεὶς τῶν ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ λέγεται καλλίων καὶ μείζων ἀνὴρ δόξαι εἶναι, ὁσάκις ἐκεῖνος ἢ παρὰ μέγαν βασιλέα ἢ παρὰ ἄλλον τινὰ τῶν ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ πρεσβεύων ἀφίκετο, σύμπασα δὲ αὕτη ἡ οἰκία οὐδὲν τῆς ἑτέρας ὑποδεεστέρα.	and then, your mother’s house is famous in the same way, for of Pyrilampes, your uncle, it is said that no one in all the continent was considered to be his superior in beauty or stature, whenever he came as envoy to the great king or anyone else in Asia, and his house as a whole is no whit inferior to the other.
καὶ οἱ πέντε σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἑώρων, καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν εἰς Ἀσκάλωνα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.	And the five leaders of the Philistines were watching and returned to Askalon on that day.
ἢ ὅτε τὸν Ψευδομάριον λαβὼν ἐπιβουλεύοντα ἀπέκτεινε καὶ ἐπῃνέσατε πάντες καὶ τοῦτο μόνον δι’ ὑμᾶς οὐ διέβαλε Κικέρων;	Was it when he seized that conspirator, the false Marius, and put him to death, and you all applauded?
εἰς τιμὴν οὖν ἐκείνου τοῦ θελήσαντος ἡμᾶς πρέπον ἐστὶν ἐπακούειν κατὰ μηδεμίαν ὑπόκρισιν: ἐπεὶ οὐχ ὅτι τὸν ἐπίσκοπον τοῦτον τὸν βλεπόμενον πλανᾷ τις, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀόρατον παραλογίζεται. τὸ δὲ τοιοῦτον οὐ πρὸς σάρκα ὁ λόγος, ἀλλὰ πρὸς θεὸν τὸν τὰ κρύφια εἰδότα.	For the honour therefore of him who desired us, it is right that we yield obedience without hypocrisy, for a man does not merely deceive this bishop who is seen, but is dealing wrongly with him who is invisible. And in this matter his reckoning is not with flesh, but with God, who knows the secret things.
ἐξέπεσον αὖθις οἱ πολλοὶ τῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν εὐνοίας, εἰς τὸ νεμεσᾶν καὶ φθονεῖν ὑποφερόμενοι.	the multitude fell away again from their good will towards him, and drifted into feelings of resentment and envy.
καὶ τῷ Γεδεὼν ἦσαν ἑβδομήκοντα υἱοὶ ἐκπεπορευμένοι ἐκ μηρῶν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι γυναῖκες πολλαὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ.	And Gideon had seventy sons, ⌊his own offspring⌋, because ⌊he had many wives⌋.
ὃ δὴ καὶ νῦν οὑμὸς λόγος πᾶσιν παρακελεύεται, τοῖς μὲν τυραννίδος ἐφιεμένοις ἀποτρέπεσθαι καὶ φεύγειν φυγῇ ἀπλήστως πεινώντων εὐδαιμόνισμα ἀνθρώπων καὶ ἀνοήτων, εἰς βασιλέως δ’ εἶδος πειρᾶσθαι μεταβάλλειν καὶ δουλεῦσαι νόμοις βασιλικοῖς, τὰς μεγίστας τιμὰς κεκτημένους παρ’ ἑκόντων τε ἀνθρώπων καὶ τῶν νόμων·	Those of you who are rushing after despotic power I exhort to change their course and to flee betimes from what is counted as bliss by men of insatiable cravings and empty heads, and to try to transform themselves into the semblance of a king, and to become subject to kingly laws, owing their possession of the highest honors to the voluntary goodwill of the citizens and to the laws.
ἐγὼ δ’ ὅσα τελευτῶν ὡμολόγησεν ἔχειν αὐτὸς χρήματα, ἑπτὰ τάλαντα καὶ τετταράκοντα μνᾶς, ἐκ τούτων αὐτῷ λογιοῦμαι, πρόσοδον μὲν οὐδεμίαν ἀποφαίνων, ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἀναλίσκων, καὶ θήσω ὅσον οὐδεὶς πώποτ’ ἐν τῇ πόλει, εἰς δύο παῖδας καὶ ἀδελφὴν καὶ παιδαγωγὸν καὶ θεράπαιναν χιλίας δραχμὰς ἑκάστου ἐνιαυτοῦ,	I will now base my reckoning against him on the sum which he did eventually confess to holding,—seven talents and forty minae not counting in any income, I will put down, as spent out of capital, a larger amount than anyone in the city has ever spent,—for two boys and their sister, an attendant and a maid, a thousand drachmae a year, a little less than three drachmae a day.
ἔδοξεν οὖν περὶ μέσας νύκτας εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν παραγαγόντας ἀναδεικνύειν αὐτοκράτορα τὸν Νυμφίδιον.	It was decided, therefore, to bring Nymphidius into the camp about midnight and proclaim him emperor.
ἀήττητοι γὰρ ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὑπό γε ἐκείνων ἐσμέν, ἡμεῖς δὲ αὐτοὶ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐνικήσαμεν καὶ ἡττήθημεν.	And in truth it was by our own dissensions that we were brought down and not by the hands of other men for by them we are still to this day undefeated, and it is we ourselves who have both defeated and been defeated by ourselves.
Οὐκ ἔστι τὸν λάθρᾳ τι κινοῦντα ὧν συνέθεντο πρὸς ἀλλήλους εἰς τὸ μὴ βλάπτειν μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι, πιστεύειν ὅτι λήσει, κἂν μυριάκις ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος λανθάνῃ.	35. It is impossible for the man who secretly violates any article of the social compact to feel confident that he will remain undiscovered, even if he has already escaped ten thousand times
τὸ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων αἴτιον ἀγαθῶν πάντων ἡμῖν αὐτὸν γεγονέναι πάντες ἂν ὁμολογοῖμεν·	That it has been the cause of all the other good things we have, we shall all admit
μεστοί τε ὁσίας βουλῆς, ἐν ἀγαθῇ προθυμίᾳ μετ̓ εὐσεβοῦς πεποιθήσεως ἐξετείνετε τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν πρὸς τὸν παντοκράτορα θεόν, ἱκετεύοντες αὐτὸν ἵλέως γενέσθαι, εἴ τι ἄκοντες ἡμάρτετε.	You were full of holy plans, and with pious confidence you stretched out your hands to Almighty God in a passion of goodness, beseeching him to be merciful towards any unwilling sin.
καὶ παρεβιάζετο αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν πρὸς αὐτόν. καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πότον καὶ ἀζύμους ἔπεψεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔφαγον	And he constrained them, and they turned aside to him and entered into his house. And he made them a drink and baked them unleavened loaves, and they ate before they fell asleep.
ἀναβλέψας εἶδον κριὸν ἕνα μέγαν ἑστῶτα ἀπέναντι τῆς πύλης, καὶ εἶχε κέρατα, καὶ τὰ κέρατα ὑψηλά· καὶ τὸ ἓν ὑψηλότερον τοῦ ἑτέρου, καὶ τὸ ὑψηλότερον ἀνέβαινε.	when I looked up, I saw a large ram standing before the gate, and it had horns, and the horns were lifted up, and one was higher than the other one, and the higher one was continuing to grow higher.
λέγεται γὰρ ἐξίστασθαι τὰ ἐπιληπτικὰ καὶ νοσώδη πρὸς τὸν ἄκρατον ἀποσφακελίζοντα, τὰ δ’ ὑγιεινὰ μᾶλλον στομοῦσθαι καὶ κρατύνεσθαι τὴν ἕξιν.	For it is said that epileptic and sickly infants are thrown into convulsions by the strong wine and loose their senses, while the healthy ones are rather tempered by it, like steel, and given a firm habit of body.
νῦν δ᾽ αὖτε σωτὴρ ἴσθι καὶ παιώνιος, ἄναξ Ἄπολλον.	but now, in other mood, be our preserver and our healer, o lord apollo.
καὶ ἐὰν διψήσωσιν, δι᾽ ἐρήμου ἄξει αὐτοῖς ὕδωρ, ἐκ πέτρας ἐξάξει αὐτοῖς, σχισθήσεται πέτρα καὶ ῥυήσεται ὕδωρ, καὶ πίεται ὁ λαός μου.	And if they thirst, he will bring them water through the desert; he will bring it out for them from a rock. A rock will split open, and water will flow, and my people will drink.
τὰ μὲν οὖν ἐν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς γεγραμμένα τοιαῦτα ἐστι.	Such, then, is the purport of his letters.
εἰ δ’ ἐξ ἅπαντος ἀγαπᾶς ἀσφάλειαν καὶ ἡσυχίαν, καὶ δέδιας Ἀλκιβιάδην μὲν ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος, ἐν δὲ Πύλῳ Λακεδαιμονίους, Περδίκκαν δ’ ἐν Θρᾴκῃ, πολλὴν εὐρυχωρίαν ἡ πόλις ἔχει σχολῆς ἐκ μέσου γενόμενον καθῆσθαι πλέκοντα τῆς ἀταραξίας σεαυτῷ στέφανον, ὡς ἔνιοι σοφισταὶ λέγουσιν.	But if, like Nicias, you set your heart above all else on security and quiet, and fear Alcibiades on the bema, and the Lacedaemonians at Pylos, and Perdiccas in Thrace, then there is ample room in the city where you can sit at leisure, removed from all activity, and weaving for yourself, as sundry Sophists say, a crown of tranquillity.
οἳ δ’ ἐπεὶ οὖν λεχέων εὐποιήτων ἐπέβησαν, κόσμον μέν οἱ πρῶτον ἀπὸ χροὸς εἷλε φαεινόν, πόρπας τε γναμπτάς θ’ ἕλικας κάλυκάς τε καὶ ὅρμους. λῦσε δέ οἱ ζώνην ἰδὲ εἵματα σιγαλόεντα ἔκδυε καὶ κατέθηκεν ἐπὶ θρόνου ἀργυροήλου Ἀγχίσης·	And when they had gone up upon the well-fitted bed, first Anchises took off her bright jewelry of pins and twisted brooches and earrings and necklaces, and loosed her girdle and stripped off her bright garments and laid them down upon a silver-studded seat.
ἐν δὲ τῇ μάχῃ, καίπερ ἔχοντα δυσχρήστως καὶ κωλυόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων, ἵππον αὑτῷ κελεῦσαι τῶν φορέων προσαγαγεῖν καὶ περιβάντα συμμῖξαι τοῖς ἐπὶ τῆς φάλαγγος ἀθωράκιστον·	He says further that in the battle, although he was in a wretched plight, and although his friends tried to deter him, the king ordered a pack-horse to be brought to him, mounted it, and joined his troops in the phalanx without a breastplate
τὰ δὲ κιβώτια τὰ δέκα κεῖται ἐν τ̣ῷ ἔμπροσθεν τ̣ῆς εἰσόδου καθ᾽ ἑκάστην τὴν φυλήν. ἐπιγέγραπται δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν τὰ στ̣ο̣ιχεῖα μέχρι τοῦ κ.	the ten boxes lie in front of the entrance for each tribe. they have inscribed on them the letters as far as kappa.
ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα φράσω σοι πάντα τἄνω πράγματα, τουτὶ λαβών μου τὸ σκιάδειον ὑπέρεχε ἄνωθεν, ὡς ἂν μή μ᾽ ὁρῶσιν οἱ θεοί.	but, if you want me to tell you how things are going in heaven, take this umbrella and shield me, so that the gods don't see me.
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Σαμψών Ἐὰν δήσωσίν με ἐν ἑπτὰ νευρέαις ὑγραῖς μὴ διεφθαρμέναις, καὶ ἀσθενήσω καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων.	Samson said to her, “If they should bind me with seven moist cords, not desiccated, then I will be weak and will be like one of humankind.”
τί δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις προσήκοι ἂν πάσχειν, ἓν εἰ ἔστιν, ἆρα οὐ σκεπτέον;	Must we not consider what is likely to happen to the other things, if the one exists?
ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς δι᾽ ἀβύσσου ὡς ἵππον δι᾽ ἐρήμου, καὶ οὐκ ἐκοπίασαν,	He led them through the deep like a horse through the desert, and they did not grow weary.
ἔστι δὲ οὐκ ἀτρεκηΐη πρηγμάτων οὐδ’ ὑπίσχομαι τἀληθὲς εἰδέναι·	The facts are not absolutely correct, nor do I claim to have discovered the truth, but merely such things as one who inquires about the gods picks up.
ἐποίησε δὲ ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν ταῦτα ὁ Ἀλκαμένης, Πειρίθουν τε εἶναι Διὸς ἐν ἔπεσι τοῖς Ὁμήρου δεδιδαγμένος καὶ Θησέα ἐπιστάμενος ὡς εἴη τέταρτος ἀπὸ Πέλοπος.	Alcamenes, I think, carved this scene, because he had learned from Homer's poem that Peirithous was a son of Zeus, and because he knew that Theseus was a great grandson of Pelops.
καὶ διαρρήδην μαρτυρήσας γνησίους τοὺς παῖδας εἶναι, οἴεται ἐξαρκέσειν ὑμῖν παρεκβάσεις, ἐὰν δὲ τοῦτο μὲν μηδ’ ἐγχειρήσῃ ἐπιδεικνύναι ἢ καὶ κατὰ μικρόν τι ἐπιμνησθῇ, ἡμῖν δὲ λοιδορήσηται μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ καὶ λέγῃ ὡς εἰσὶν οἵδε μὲν πλούσιοι αὐτὸς δὲ πένης, διὰ δὲ ταῦτα δόξειν τοὺς παῖδας εἶναι γνησίους.	now he is depriving everyone else of their right to claim. Having explicitly stated in his evidence that the children are legitimate, he thinks that you will be satisfied with rhetorical digressions, and that if he does not attempt to prove his point or dwells only very lightly upon it, but rails against us in a loud voice and says that my clients are rich, while he is poor—all this will make it appear that the children are legitimate.
καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετο φάσεχ ὅμοιον αὐτῷ ἐν Ἰσραήλ· ἀπό ἡμερῶν Σαμουὴλ τοῦ προφήτου καὶ παντὸς βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἐποίησαν ὡς τὸ φάσεχ ὃ ἐποίησεν Ἰωσείας καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευεῖται καὶ πᾶς Ἰουδὰ καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὁ εὑρεθεὶς καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῷ κυρίῳ	There had been no Passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, and for every king of Israel they had not made such a Passover like Josiah and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel, the ones who were found there and the ones who dwelled in Jerusalem, made to the Lord,
Λευκίῳ δὲ ὄντι δημοτικῷ καὶ δυσχεραίνοντι τῇ τῶν τριῶν ἀρχῇ, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τῷ χρόνῳ παύσεσθαι νομιζομένῃ, προσκρούσματα ἐς τὸν Καίσαρα ἐγίγνετο καὶ διαφοραὶ μείζους·	Lucius Antonius, who was a republican and ill affected toward the triumvirate, which seemed not likely to come to an end at the appointed time, fell into controversy, and even graver differences, with Octavius.
καὶ συνάξουσιν συναγωγὴν αὐτῆς εἰς δεσμωτήριον καὶ ἀποκλείσουσιν εἰς ὀχύρωμα, διὰ πολλῶν γενεῶν ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται αὐτῶν.	And they will gather a company from the land into a prison and shut them up in a fortress; the examination of them will last for many generations.
ἄλλοι δὲ λίθοι πολλοὶ κύκλῳ τοῦ πύργου ἔκειντο, καὶ οὐκ ἐχρῶντο αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκοδομήν: ἦσαν γάρ τινες ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐψωριακότες, ἕτεροι δὲ σχισμὰς ἔχοντες, ἄλλοι δὲ κεκολοβωμένοι, ἄλλοι δὲ λευκοὶ καὶ στρογγύλοι, μὴ ἁρμόζοντες εἰς τὴν οἰκοδομήν.	And many other stones were lying round the tower, and they did not use them for the building, for some of them were rotten, and others had cracks, and others were too short, and others were white and round and did not fit into the building.
ἰδεῖν μὲν γὰρ ψυχὴν ἔφη τήν ποτε Ὀρφέως γενομένην κύκνου βίον αἱρουμένην, μίσει τοῦ γυναικείου γένους διὰ τὸν ὑπ’ ἐκείνων θάνατον οὐκ ἐθέλουσαν ἐν γυναικὶ γεννηθεῖσαν γενέσθαι·	He saw the soul that had been Orpheus’, he said, selecting the life of a swan, because from hatred of the tribe of women, owing to his death at their hands, it was unwilling to be conceived and born of a woman.
Μασσανάσσης μὲν οὖν, οἷα πλεονεκτῶν καὶ Ῥωμαίοις ἀεὶ θαρρῶν, ἐπέτρεπεν, οἱ Καρχηδόνιοι δ’ ὑπώπτευον, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοὺς πρότερον ᾔδεσαν οὐκ εὖ δικάσαντας.	Masinissa, who was grabbing more than his share and who had confidence in the Romans, consented. The Carthaginians hesitated, because their former experience had led them to fear that they should not receive justice.
ἀλλ’ οὐ νῦν, ἀλλὰ παραστησάμενος τὸν τῆς ὀρφανίας τοῖς παισὶν αἴτιον, τί ποτ’ ἀνερεῖ, ἢ τί φθέγξεται;	For when the herald has led forward the man who is responsible for making the children orphans, what will he proclaim?
καὶ ὅσον οὔπω παρακελευομένων ἀλλήλοις ἐνάρχεσθαι παίει τις αὐτῶν τὸν ἕτερον κατὰ τῆς κεφαλῆς ξίφει, καὶ πεσόντος οὔθ’ ὁ παίσας ἔμεινεν οὔδ’ ὁ μετὰ τοῦ πληγέντος ἥκων, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνος μὲν, ὥσπερ εἶχε τὸ ξίφος, φεύγων πρός τινα πέτραν ὑψηλὴν ἀνεπήδησεν, ἅτερος δὲ τοῦ βωμοῦ λαβόμενος ἄδειαν ᾐτεῖτο παρὰ τοῦ Τιμολέοντος ἐπὶ τῷ πάντα μηνῦσαι.	And as they were just on the point of exhorting one another to begin their work, somebody smote one of them on the head with a sword and laid him low, whereupon neither he who had struck the blow nor the companion of him who had received it kept his place; but the one, with his sword still in his hand, fled to a lofty rock and sprang upon it, while the other laid hold of the altar and begged immunity from Timoleon on the condition of his revealing everything.
Κόρινθος δὲ καὶ ἡ ἐπὶ τῷ ἰσθμῷ χώρα τροφὸς τῷ Οἰδίποδι ἐγένετο·	Corinth and the land at the Isthmus were the scene of his upbringing.
πυρῶν δὲ καιομένων πρὸς αὐταῖς πολεμίων ἀπογνόντες ἐκείνην τὴν ὁδὸν αὖθις ἀνεχώρησαν εἰς τὸν αὐτὸν τόπον, οὔτε πάντες ἔνιοι γὰρ ἀπέδρασαν οὔτε ὁμοίως οἱ παραμένοντες πρόθυμοι·	In the passes, however, the enemy were burning fires, so the fugitives despaired of this road and once more returned to their place in the forest-not all of them, for some had run away nor was the remnant as willing as before.
οὐδεμία γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπισκοπεῖ καθόλου περὶ τοῦ ὄντος ᾗ ὄν, ἀλλὰ μέρος αὐτοῦ τι ἀποτεμόμεναι περὶ τούτου θεωροῦσι τὸ συμβεβηκός, οἷον αἱ μαθηματικαὶ τῶν ἐπιστημῶν.	this science is not the same as any of the so - called particular sciences, for none of the others contemplates being generally qua being;
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἐλιακεὶμ τὸν οἰκονόμον καὶ Σόμναν τὸν γραμματέα καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν ἱερέων περιβεβλημένους σάκκους πρὸς Ἠσαίαν τὸν προφήτην υἱὸν Ἀμώς,	He sent Eliakim the steward, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν συναγάγετε μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν ὑμῶν καὶ φάγετε κρέα.	This is what the Lord says: “Gather your whole burnt offerings with your sacrifices and eat meat.
οἱ δὲ παραλαβόντες, ἐὰν μὴ δύνωνται διαλῦσαι, γιγνώσκουσι, κἂν μὲν ἀμφοτέροις ἀρέσκῃ τὰ γνωσθέντα καὶ ἐμμένωσιν, ἔχει τέλος ἡ δίκη.	these take over the cases, and if they are unable to effect a compromise, they give judgement, and if both parties are satisfied with their judgement and abide by it, that ends the suit.
ταύτην ἀποδίδωσι τῷ κυρίῳ τῷ ἐπιχορηγοῦντι αὐτῷ.	And the rich man likewise provides the poor, without hesitating, with the wealth which he received from the Lord
συμβουλεύω σοι ἀγοράσαι χρυσίον παρ' ἐμοῦ πεπυρωμένον ἐκ πυρός, ἵνα πλουτήσῃς, καὶ ἱμάτια λευκά, ἵνα περιβάλῃ, καὶ μὴ φανερωθῇ ἡ αἰσχύνη τῆς γυμνότητός σου· καὶ κολλύριον ἵνα ἐγχρίσῃ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, ἵνα βλέπῃς.	"I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.
περὶ δὲ τοῦ Βρούτου τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἦν ἀκούειν ὅτι μόνος τῶν ἐπὶ Καίσαρα συναραμένων ἕνα προὔθετο σκοπὸν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ἄχρι τέλους τὴν πάτριον ἀποδοῦναι Ῥωμαίοις πολιτείαν.	but the enemies of Brutus were wont to say that of all the conspirators against Caesar he alone had one aim from first to last, namely the restoration to the Romans of their ancient form of government.
Ἔλεγεν δὲ αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι Οὐκ ἔστιν προφήτης ἄτιμος, εἰ μὴ ἐν τῇ πατρίδι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς συγγενέσιν καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ.	But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house."
διὸ δὴ καὶ φιλοσοφοῦσιν οἱ οὔτε ἀγαθοὶ οὔτε κακοί πω ὄντες, ὅσοι δὲ κακοὶ οὐ φιλοσοφοῦσιν, οὐδὲ οἱ ἀγαθοί·	It follows, then, that those who are as yet neither good nor bad are lovers of wisdom, while all who are bad, and all the good, are not
Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἡ Μυγδονία ὀρθρίσασα ἀπῄει εἰς ἀσπασμὸν Ἰούδα Θωμᾶ τοῦ ἀποστόλου. κατέλαβεν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁμιλοῦντα μετὰ τοῦ στρατηλάτου καὶ τοῦ παντὸς ὄχλου·	And likewise Mygdonia rose up early and went to salute Judas Thomas the apostle, and she found him discoursing with the captain and all the multitude, and he was advising them and speaking of the woman which had received the Lord in her soul, whose wife she was
ὃ καὶ Πύρρον φασὶν εἰπεῖν πρὸ αὐτοῦ, τὸν Ἠπείρου βασιλέα, Ῥωμαίων κἀκεῖνον ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ κρατοῦντα σὺν ὁμοίᾳ ζημίᾳ.	It is said that Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, made the same exclamation aforetime, when he too gained a victory over the Romans in Italy, with like loss to himself.
ἐν δὲ τῇ πρὸς Ἀργείους καὶ Κλεωναίους μάχῃ τῶν Κορινθίων ὁ μὲν Τιμολέων ἔτυχεν ἐν τοῖς ὁπλίταις τεταγμένος, τὸν δὲ Τιμοφάνην τῶν ἱππέων ἡγούμενον καταλαμβάνει κίνδυνος ὀξύς.	In the battle fought by the Corinthians against the Argives and Cleonaeans, Timoleon was stationed among the men-at-arms, and Timophanes, who commanded the cavalry, was overtaken by extreme peril.
Καὶ ὁ λαλῶν μετ' ἐμοῦ εἶχεν μέτρον κάλαμον χρυσοῦν, ἵνα μετρήσῃ τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῆς.	And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
ἐκδεξάμενος τὸ ἀργύριον παρὰ Διονυσίου, Πλάτωνος ἄραντος βιβλίον, πρὸς τὸν αἰτιασάμενον, ἐγω μὲν γάρ, εἶπεν, ἀργυρίων, Πλάτων δὲ βιβλίων ἐστὶν ἐνδεής.	He received a sum of money from Dionysius at the same time that Plato carried off a book and, when he was twitted with this, his reply was,, Well, I want money, Plato wants books.
μόριον γὰρ εἶναί πως ψυχῆς οἴονται τὸν νοῦν, οὐδὲν ἧττον ἐκείνων·	For they imagine that the understanding is a part of the soul, but they err in this no less than those who make the soul to be a part of the body
καὶ ὁ Κλαύδιος πανούργως διῄρει καὶ ἐπυνθάνετο αὐτῶν παρὰ μέρος, εἰ δοκεῖ Καίσαρι πέμπειν διαδόχους καὶ εἰ Πομπήιον τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφαιρεῖσθαι.	"Shall successors be sent to Caesar?" and again, "Shall Pompey be deprived of his command?"
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς Ἰσμαήλ, αὐτοὶ ἐπορεύοντο καὶ ἔκλαιον, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Εἰσέλθετε πρὸς Γοδολίαν.	And Ishmael came out to meet them. They kept going and weeping, and he said to them, “Enter to Gedaliah.”
οὗτοι δὲ ἐκεῖνον ἀποφαίνουσιν, ἐν ᾧ πρὸς ἡμᾶς οἰκειότατα διέκειτο, μᾶλλον βεβαιοῦν τὴν διαθήκην βουλόμενον, ἣν ὀργιζόμενος ἐποιήσατο.	Cleonymus is represented by my opponents as desirous, when he was on terms of the closest affection with us, still further to confirm the will which he made in anger.
οἱ δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐκέλευον ἐκδοῦναί τε αὐτοῖς Λασθένη τὸν πολεμήσαντα Ἀντωνίῳ, καὶ τὰ σκάφη τὰ λῃστικὰ πάντα παραδοῦναι, καὶ ὅσα Ῥωμαίων εἶχον αἰχμάλωτα, καὶ ὅμηρα τριακόσια καὶ ἀργυρίου τάλαντα τετρακισχίλια.	The Romans ordered them to surrender Lasthenes, the author of the war against Antonius, and to deliver up all their pirate ships and all the Roman prisoners in their hands, together with 300 hostages, and to pay 4000 talents of silver.
δικάζουσι δ᾽ οἱ λαχόντες ταῦτ᾽ ἐφέται πλὴν τῶν ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ γιγνομένων, εἰσάγει δ᾽ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ δικάζουσιν ἐν ἱερῷ καὶ ὑπαίθριοι, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὅταν δικάζῃ περιαιρεῖται τὸν στέφανον.	commissioners appointed by lot try these cases, except those that are held on the areopagus; the cases are introduced by the king, and the court sits within the sacred precinct in the open air, and when the king is acting in a case he takes off his crown.
καὶ ἐξαποστέλλουσιν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς Ἀσκάλωνα. καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς εἰσῆλθεν κιβωτὸς θεοῦ εἰς Ἀσκάλωνα, καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ Ἀσκαλωνεῖται λέγοντες Τί ἀπεστρέψατε πρὸς ἡμᾶς τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, θανατῶσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὸν λαὸν ἡμῶν;	So they sent away the ark of God to Askalon, and it happened that as the ark of God entered Askalon and the people of Ekron cried out saying, “Why do you bring back to us the ark of God of Israel to kill us and our people?”
τοῦτον τὸν Τῖσιν ἐπανιόντα ἐκ Δελφῶν λοχῶσιν ἄνδρες Λακεδαιμονίων ἀπὸ τῆς ἐν Ἀμφείᾳ φρουρᾶς·	While he was returning from Delphi men from the Lacedaemonian garrison at Ampheia laid an ambush for him.
εἰ ἄρα πάντα τὰ μέρη ἐν ὅλῳ τυγχάνει ὄντα, ἔστι δὲ τά τε πάντα τὸ ἓν καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ ὅλον, περιέχεται δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὅλου τὰ πάντα, ὑπὸ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἂν περιέχοιτο τὸ ἕν, καὶ οὕτως ἂν ἤδη τὸ ἓν αὐτὸ ἐν ἑαυτῷ εἴη.	Then if all the parts are in the whole and all the parts are the one and the one is also the whole, and all the parts are included in the whole, the one will be included in the one, and thus the one will be in itself.
Καὶ εἰσήγαγέν με εἰς τὸ αἰλὰμ τοῦ οἴκου. καὶ διεμέτρησεν τὸ αἲλ τοῦ αἰλὰμ πηχῶν πέντε τὸ πλάτος ἔνθεν καὶ πηχῶν πέντε ἔνθεν, καὶ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ θυρώματος πηχῶν δέκα τεσσάρων, καὶ ἐπωμίδες τῆς θύρας τοῦ αἰλὰμ πηχῶν τριῶν ἔνθεν καὶ πηχῶν τριῶν ἔνθεν.	And he led me into the Elam of the house. And he measured the doorpost of the Elam: five cubits in width on the one side and five cubits on the other side, and the width of the doorway fourteen cubits, and the side walls of the door of the Elam three cubits on the one side and three cubits on the other side,
κατασκευασθῆναι δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ μὲν ὑπὸ Ἡρακλέους τοῦ Ἰδαίου λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ ἡρώων τῶν ἐπιχωρίων γενεαῖς δύο ὕστερον τοῦ Ἡρακλέους.	Some say that it was built by Idaean Heracles, others by the local heroes two generations later than Heracles.
Ὅτι οὓς προέγνω, καὶ προώρισεν συμμόρφους τῆς εἰκόνος τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν πρωτότοκον ἐν πολλοῖς ἀδελφοῖς·	For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.
ἔπειτα τοὺς πρεπόντως καὶ δικαίως ὁμιλοῦντας τοῖς ἀεὶ πλησιάζουσι, καὶ τὰς μὲν τῶν ἄλλων ἀηδίας καὶ βαρύτητας εὐκόλως καὶ ῥᾳδίως φέροντας, σφᾶς δ’ αὐτοὺς ὡς δυνατὸν ἐλαφροτάτους καὶ μετριωτάτους τοῖς συνοῦσι παρέχοντας·	next, those who are decent and honorable in their intercourse with all with whom they associate, tolerating easily and good-naturedly what is unpleasant or offensive in others and being themselves as agreeable and reasonable to their associates as it is possible to be
ἁπάντων οὖν τούτων ἀναμνησθέντες ἐρρωμενέστερον ἀντιλαβώμεθα τοῦ πολέμου, καὶ μὴ περιμένωμεν ὡς ἄλλων τινῶν τὰς παρούσας ἀτυχίας ἰασομένων, ἀλλ’ ἐπειδή περ ἐφ’ ἡμῶν γεγόνασιν, ἡμεῖς αὐτὰς καὶ διαλῦσαι πειραθῶμεν.	Let us, then, remembering all these things, take up the war with greater vigor, and let us not delay in the expectation that others will remedy our present misfortunes, but since these have occurred in our own time, let us ourselves endeavor also to end them.
ταὐτὸν δὴ καὶ πόλει, εἴτε αὐτῆς εἷς εἴη κύριος εἴτε καὶ πλείους, εἰ μὲν κατὰ τρόπον ὀρθῇ πορευομένης ὁδῷ τῆς πολιτείας συμβουλεύοιτό τι τῶν προσφόρων, νοῦν ἔχοντος τὸ τοῖς τοιούτοις συμβουλεύειν·	So too with a State, whether it has one ruler or many, if so be that it asks for some salutary advice when its government is duly proceeding by the right road, then it is the act of a judicious man to give advice to such people.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαίας πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν Λάβε παλάθην ἐκ σύκων καὶ τρίψον καὶ κατάπλασαι, καὶ ὑγιὴς ἔσῃ.	And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Take a cake of figs and crush it and apply it as a plaster, and you will be healthy.”
καί τινος αὐτῷ τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ δήμου ἀντειπόντος κατὰ τὸ στασιωτικὸν ὅτι οὐκ ἐπέξεισιν οὐδὲ δέοιτο πολεμεῖν, καὶ ὡς ἀντεῖπεν ἐπισπασθέντος τε τῇ χειρὶ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ θορυβηθέντος, ὁ δῆμος εὐθὺς ἀναλαβὼν τὰ ὅπλα περιοργὴς ἐχώρει ἐπί τε Πελοποννησίους καὶ τοὺς τὰ ἐναντία σφίσι μετ’ αὐτῶν πράξαντας.	At this moment one of the popular party answered him factiously that they would not go out and did not want a war, and for thus answering was dragged by the arm and knocked about by Polydamidas. Hereupon the infuriated commons at once seized their arms and rushed at the Peloponnesians and at their allies of the opposite faction.
ἀετοὶ δὲ καὶ γλαῦκες καὶ ἱέρακες ζῶντα κόπτουσι τὰ ὁμόφυλα καὶ φονεύουσι·	But eagles, owls, and hawks smite their own kind when alive, and kill them.
πῶς δ’ ἂν ἠδύνατο Ῥᾳδίως αἱματοῦσθαι μὴ προπαρασκευασθέντα τῇ τοιαύτῃ μεταβολῇ;	How could it easily become blood if it were not previously prepared by means of a change of this kind?
ὅσοι δὲ βουλήσονται τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπινον τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι, ὠφέλιμα κρίνειν αὐτὰ ἀρκούντως ἕξει.	but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it, I shall be content.
Καὶ ἤρξατο Σαλωμὼν τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐν ὄρει τοῦ Ἁμορειά, οὗ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Δαυεὶδ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ ἡτοίμασεν Δαυεὶδ ἐν ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου.	Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, at the mountain of Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father, David, in the place where David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ζοροβαβὲλ καὶ Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν πατριῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ Οὐχ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἡμεῖς ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ οἰκοδομήσομεν τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ ἡμῶν, ὡς ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν Κῦρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν.	And Zerubbabel and Joshua and the rest of the chiefs of the paternal families of Israel said to them, “It is not for us and for you to build a house to our God, for we will build it to the Lord, our God, as Cyrus, king of Persia, commanded us.”
εὐλογῶ σε, ὅτι ἠξίωσάς με τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ ὥρας ταύτης, τοῦ λαβεῖν με μέρος ἐν ἀριθμῷ τῶν μαρτύρων ἐν τῷ ποτηρίῳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ σου εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς αἰωνίου ψυχῆς τε καὶ σώματος ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ πνεύματος ἁγίου:	I bless thee, that Thou hast granted me this day and hour, that I may share, among the number of the martyrs, in the cup of thy Christ, for the Resurrection to everlasting life, both of soul and body in the immortality of the Holy Spirit.
πρῶτος δὲ Ἀναξαγόρας καὶ βιβλίον ἐξέδωκε συγγραφῆς.	Anaxagoras was also the first to publish a book with diagrams.
καὶ ὑπὸ μὲν τὴν βούλησιν εὔνοιαν, εὐμένειαν, ἀσπασμόν, ἀγάπησιν·	Thus under wishing they bring well-wishing or benevolence, friendliness, respect, affection
καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτοῖς τοῦτο πρῶτον ἀντεκεκρούκει, ἐλπίσασιν ἀμαχὶ λήψεσθαι τὴν πόλιν.	Thus they met a rebuff at the very beginning, in expecting to take the city without fighting.
ὅπως ἐνδοξασθῇ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν αὐτῷ, κατὰ τὴν χάριν τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ.	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ἀλλὰ νὴ Δία ἄλλον τινὰ ποιησάμενος τῶν συγγενῶν ἔδωκεν ἂν ἔχειν τὸν κλῆρον καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα τὴν ἑαυτοῦ.	But, it may be urged, he might have adopted some other kinsman and given him the possession of his estate and his daughter.
φῶμεν ἄρα τὸ ἐναντίον τῷ ἐναντίῳ μάλιστα φίλον εἶναι;	Then are we to say that the opposite is most friendly to its opposite?
Ἀθηναίους δὲ καὶ πλέον τι τῶν ἄλλων εἰκὸς τοῦτο δρᾶσαι, οἳ ἄρχειν τε τῶν ἄλλων ἀξιοῦσι καὶ ἐπιόντες τὴν τῶν πέλας δῃοῦν μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν αὑτῶν ὁρᾶν.	The Athenians are the very people of all others to do this, as they aspire to rule the rest of the world, and are more in the habit of invading and ravaging their neighbors' territory, than of seeing their own treated in the like fashion.
κακοῦ δὲ χαλκοῦ τρόπον τρίβῳ τε καὶ προσβολαῖς μελαμπαγὴς πέλει δικαιωθείς, ἐπεὶ διώκει παῖς ποτανὸν ὄρνιν, πόλει πρόστριμμ᾽ ἄφερτον ἐνθείς.	like base metal beneath the touchstone's rub, when tested he shows the blackness of his grain [ for he is like a child who chases a winged bird ] and upon his people he brings a taint against which there is no defence.
ἐπὶ τῷ ὕδατι αὐτῆς, καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται, ὅτι γῆ τῶν γλυπτῶν ἐστιν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς νήσοις οὗ κατεκαυχῶντο.	over her water, so that they will be disgraced, for it is a land of graven images; and among the islands where they were boasting.

δυσφορῶν οὖν ὁ Παυσανίας τοῖς παροῦσιν, ἄλλα τοῦ μάντεως ἐπ’ ἄλλοις ἱερεῖα καταβάλλοντος, τρέπεται πρὸς τὸ Ἡραῖον τῇ ὄψει δεδακρυμένος, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας ἀνασχὼν εὔξατο Κιθαιρωνίᾳ Ἥρᾳ καὶ θεοῖς ἄλλοις, οἳ Πλαταιΐδα γῆν ἔχουσιν, εἰ μὴ πέπρωται τοῖς Ἕλλησι νικᾶν, ἀλλὰ δράσαντάς γέ τι παθεῖν καὶ δείξαντας ἔργῳ τοῖς πολεμίοις, ὡς ἐπ’ ἄνδρας ἀγαθοὺς καὶ μάχεσθαι μεμαθηκότας ἐστράτευσαν.	Then, in distress at this state of affairs, while the seer slew victim after victim, Pausanias turned his face, all tears, toward the Heraeum, and with hands uplifted prayed Cithaeronian Hera and the other gods of the Plataean land that, if it was not the lot of the Hellenes to be victorious, they might at least do great deeds before they fell, and show to a certainty that their enemies had marched out against men who were brave and who knew how to fight.
πρῶτα μὲν αὐτῶν τὰς οἰνάνθας οἱ πάρνοπες οὐ κατέδονται, ἀλλὰ γλαυκῶν λόχος εἷς αὐτοὺς καὶ κερχνῄδων ἐπιτρίψει. εἶθ᾽ οἱ κνῖπες καὶ ψῆνες ἀεὶ τὰς συκᾶς οὐ κατέδονται, ἀλλ᾽ ἀναλέξει πάντας καθαρῶς αὐτοὺς ἀγέλη μία κιχλῶν.	firstly, the locusts shall not eat up their vine - blossoms; a legion of owls and kestrels will devour them. moreover, the gnats and the gallbugs shall no longer ravage the figs; a flock of thrushes shall swallow the whole host down to the very last.

ἐπερωτηθεὶς γὰρ αὐτὸς ὁ κύριος ὑπό τινος, πότε ἥξει αὐτοῦ ἡ βασιλεία, εἶπεν:	For when the Lord himself was asked by someone when his kingdom would come, he said

Some time after this, Pittalacus came to me and said that he wished to send to Hegesandrus and come to such settlement with him that the suits should be dropped, both his own suit against Hegesandrus and Timarchus, and the suit of Hegesandrus for his enslavement. And they came to a settlement.Amphisthenes testifies to the same effect.
ὅτε δὲ οὐκέτι εἶχεν οὐδέν, ἔλεγον οἱ ἄνθρωποι δείλαιος Ἀκταίων, ὃς ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων κυνῶν κατεβρώθη, ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἐάν τις πορνοβοσκῶν ἀτυχήσῃ, λέγειν εἰώθαμεν ὑπὸ τῶν πορνῶν κατεβρώθη.	When he had nothing left, people would say, Wretched Actaion - he has been consumed by his own dogs!. It's just like how even today, when someone wastes their fortune in brothels, we say, He has been consumed by prostitutes.

καθ’ ὅσον δ’ ἐκ τῶν προειρημένων δυνατὸν ἐφικνεῖσθαι τῆς φύσεως αὐτοῦ, τῇδ’ ἄν τις ὀρθότατα λέγοι·	In so far as it is possible to arrive at the nature of this kind from the foregoing account, one may state it most correctly in this way.
Οὐρίατθος δὲ Καιπίωνι περὶ συμβάσεων τοὺς πιστοτάτους αὑτῷ φίλους ἐπέπεμπεν, Αὔδακα καὶ Διτάλκωνα καὶ Μίνουρον, οἳ διαφθαρέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ Καιπίωνος δώροις τε μεγάλοις καὶ ὑποσχέσεσι πολλαῖς ὑπέστησαν αὐτῷ κτενεῖν τὸν Οὐρίατθον.

And there he struck him in the loins and he died for the blood of Asahel the brother of Joab.
τούτοις τοῖς πρέσβεσι πλεύσασιν ἐς Ἰβηρίαν, καὶ ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἀναβαίνουσιν, ὁ Ἀννίβας ἀπηγόρευσε μὴ προσιέναι.	When they arrived in Spain and were approaching his camp from the sea, Hannibal forbade their coring.
τὴν δὲ ἐφ’ ἡμῶν πεποιήκασιν, ὄνομα δέ ἐστιν τῷ χωρίῳ Λειμών, ὅθεν ῥεῖ τὸ ὕδωρ ἐς αὐτήν.	Another well they made in our own day, and the name of the place from which the water flows into it is Leimon (Meadow).
ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀποστρέψαι δίκαιον ἐκ τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ καὶ ποιῆσαι ἀδικίαν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας ἃς ἐποίησεν ὁ ἄνομος, πᾶσαι αἱ δικαιοσύναι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐποίησεν οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν· ἐν τῷ παραπτώματι αὐτοῦ ᾧ παρέπεσεν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ αἷς ἥμαρτεν, ἐν αὐταῖς ἀποθανεῖται.	But when a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice according to all the transgressions that the lawless do, all his righteousness which he did shall certainly not be remembered. He will die in his transgression by which he transgressed and in his sins by which he sinned.
τοῖς δὲ ἀνθρώποις τότε θεασαμένοις τὰ ξύλα θαυμαστὰ ἐφαίνετο, καὶ ἔφασαν Ὀρφεὺς κιθαρίζων ἄγει ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους καὶ τὴν ὕλην.	People watching were amazed by the foliage and said, Even the forest comes down from the mountain when Orpheus plays his cithara.
καὶ ἔλαβεν Μωυσῆς τὸ ἀργύριον, τὰ λύτρα τῶν πλεοναζόντων, εἰς τὴν ἐκλύτρωσιν τῶν Λευειτῶν·	And so Moses received the ransom money for the excess numbers beyond the redemption provided by the Levites.
Δαυλιεῦσι δὲ Ἀθηνᾶς ἱερὸν καὶ ἄγαλμά ἐστιν ἀρχαῖον·	At Daulis is a sanctuary of Athena with an ancient image.
ἀναβήσεται γὰρ οἶμαι δεῦρο πιστεύων τῷ ἑαυτοῦ βίῳ ἀνὴρ καλὸς κἀγαθὸς καὶ μισοπόνηρος, καὶ τὸν Λεωδάμαντα ὅστις ἦν οὐ γιγνώσκων, ἐφ’ ᾧ ὑμεῖς ἐθορυβήσατε τῆς μαρτυρίας ἀναγιγνωσκομένης.	For he will come up here to the witness stand, I suppose, trusting in his record, honorable and upright man that he is, an enemy of all evil-doing, a man who does not know who Leodamas was—Leodamas, at whose name you yourselves raised a shout as the affidavit was being read.
καὶ καταβήσονται πάντες οἱ παῖδές σου οὗτοι πρὸς μὲ καὶ προσκυνήσουσίν με λέγοντες Ἔξελθε σὺ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός σου οὗ σὺ ἀφηγῇ· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξελεύσομαι. ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ Φαραὼ μετὰ θυμοῦ.	And all these, your servants, will come down to me and will reverence me, saying, “Go forth, you and all your people, whom you are leading forth!” And after these things I will go forth.’ ” Then Moses went forth from Pharaoh with anger.
Πορευθέντες δὲ μάθετε τί ἐστιν, Ἔλεον θέλω, καὶ οὐ θυσίαν· οὐ γὰρ ἦλθον καλέσαι δικαίους, ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλοὺς εἰς μετάνοιαν.	"But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
πάντα τὰ ξύλινά σου καὶ τὰ γενήματα τῆς γῆς σου ἐξαναλώσει ἡ ἐρυσίβη.	The blight shall destroy all your wood and the produce of your land.
μετά τε τὴν Ἀντιγόνου ναυμαχίαν πολλῶν προσιόντων καὶ ἐπιστόλια παρακλητικὰ γραφόντων αὐτὸς ἐσιώπησεν.	And after the battle at sea, when many went to Antigonus or wrote him flattering letters, he held his peace.
ὅπερ ἐπὶ τῶν μετεώρων οὐχ ὑπάρχει, ἀλλὰ ταῦτά γε πλεοναχὴν ἔχει καὶ τῆς γενέσεως αἰτίαν καὶ τῆς οὐσίας ταῖς αἰσθήσεσι σύμφωνον κατηγορίαν.	these at any rate admit of manifold causes for their occurrence and manifold accounts, none of them contradictory of sensation, of their nature.
νωθής τε γὰρ καὶ βραδὺς παρὰ τὴν αὑτοῦ φύσιν ἐν ἅπασι γεγονὼς παρεσκευάζετο ἄκων ἐς μάχην ἐπὶ κακῷ τε αὑτοῦ καὶ τῶν αὐτὸν ἀναπειθόντων.	He had now become, contrary to his nature, sluggish and dilatory in all things, and he prepared for battle against his will, to his own hurt and that of the men who had persuaded him to it.
χωρὶς γὰρ ἢ ὅσους αὐτῶν κατέλεξα ἤδη, τοσοίδε ἄλλοι τῶν ἐκ Σπάρτης ἱπποτρόφων μετὰ τὴν εἰκόνα ἀνάκεινται τοῦ Ἀκαρνᾶνος ἀθλητοῦ, Ξενάρκης καὶ Λυκῖνος Ἀρκεσίλαός τε καὶ ὁ παῖς τοῦ Ἀρκεσιλάου Λίχας.	For beside those I have already mentioned, the following horse-breeders from Sparta have their statues set up after that of the Acarnanian athlete Xenarces, Lycinus, Arcesilaus, and Lichas his son.
καὶ πλησθήσονταί σου αἱ οἰκίαι καὶ αἱ οἰκίαι τῶν θεραπόντων σου καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ οἰκίαι ἐν πάσῃ γῇ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, ἃ οὐδέποτε ἑωράκασιν οἱ πατέρες σου οὐδὲ οἱ πρόπαπποι αὐτῶν, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας γεγόνασιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. καὶ ἐκκλίνας Μωυσῆς ἐξῆλθεν ἀπὸ Φαραώ.	And your houses and the houses of your attendants and all the houses in the entire land of the Egyptians will be filled with such things as neither your fathers nor their grandfathers have ever seen, from the day that they have been upon the land until this day.’ ” And Moses turned around and went forth from Pharaoh.
Δήμητρος δὲ Ἄρτεμιν θυγατέρα εἶναι καὶ οὐ Λητοῦς, ὄντα Αἰγυπτίων τὸν λόγον Αἰσχύλος ἐδίδαξεν Εὐφορίωνος τοὺς Ἕλληνας.	That Artemis was the daughter, not of Leto but of Demeter, which is the Egyptian account, the Greeks learned from Aeschylus the son of Euphorion.
ξηρῇ γὰρ διαίτῃ ὑγρὸν ἀξύμφορον. τοιάδε μὲν, στῦψαι καὶ ψῦξαι εἰ ἐθέλεις ·	These are the proper things, provided you wish to astringe and cool.
οὗ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ κατέκαυσεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους αὐτοῦ ἔπεψεν ἐν τοῖς ἄνθραξιν ἄρτους, καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ κρέας ὀπτήσας ἔφαγεν καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη, καὶ θερμανθεὶς εἶπεν Ἡδύ μοι ὅτι ἐθερμάνθην καὶ εἶδον πῦρ·	He burned ⌊half of the wood⌋ up by fire, and with half of it he baked bread in the coals, and when he had roasted meat on it, he ate and was satisfied; and when he had warmed himself, he said, “It was nice for me that I was warmed and saw fire.”
αἰτίαν δ’ ἔχω τῆς τοῦδε μητρὸς τοῦ φόνου.	I am responsible for the murder of his mother.
ἀπεκρίθησαν δὲ ἐκ δευτέρου λέγοντες Βασιλεῦ, τὸ ὅραμα εἰπόν, καὶ οἱ παῖδές σου κρινοῦσι πρὸς ταῦτα.	But they replied a second time, saying, “O King, tell us the thing you saw, and your servants will render a discerning judgment concerning these things.”
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσῆλθον οἱ Λευεῖται λειτουργεῖν τὴν λειτουργίαν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἔναντι Ἀαρὼν καὶ ἔναντι τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ· καθὼς συνέταξεν Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ περὶ τῶν Λευειτῶν, οὕτως ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς.	And after these things, the Levites entered to perform religious duties, their public religious service in the tent of testimony before Aaron and before his sons, just as the Lord had charged Moses with respect to the Levites, just so they did concerning them.
ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ βαπτίσματος Ἰωάννου, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἀνελήφθη ἀφ' ἡμῶν, μάρτυρα τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ γενέσθαι σὺν ἡμῖν ἕνα τούτων.	"beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection."
ὅθεν αἱ μὲν εἰκόνες αὐτοῦ σχεδὸν ἅπασαι κράνεσι περιέχονται, μὴ βουλομένων, ὡς ἔοικε, τῶν τεχνιτῶν ἐξονειδίζειν.	For this reason the images of him, almost all of them, wear helmets, because the artists, as it would seem, were not willing to reproach him with deformity.
εὐθὺς γὰρ τὸ πρῶτον τοῦ ᾄσματος μανικὸν ἂν φανείη, εἰ βουλόμενος λέγειν ὅτι ἄνδρα ἀγαθὸν γενέσθαι χαλεπόν, ἔπειτα ἐνέβαλε τὸ μέν.	The opening of the ode must at once appear crazy if, while intending to say that it is hard for a man to become good, he inserted indeed.
τὸ δὲ ὅμοιον τῷ ὁμοίῳ ἆρ’ οὐ μεγάλη ἀνάγκη ἑνὸς τοῦ αὐτοῦ μετέχειν;	And must not necessarily the like partake of the same idea as its like?
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐκεῖνος τοὺς τυράννους ἔπαυσε καὶ τοὺς ὑβρίζοντας ἐκώλυσεν, ἀγῶνα μὲν σωμάτων ἐποίησε, φιλοτιμίαν δὲ πλούτου, γνώμης δ’ ἐπίδειξιν ἐν τῷ καλλίστῳ τῆς Ἑλλάδος, ἵνα τούτων ἁπάντων ἕνεκα εἰς τὸ αὐτὸ συνέλθωμεν, τὰ μὲν ὀψόμενοι, τὰ δ’ ἀκουσόμενοι· ἡγήσατο γὰρ τὸν ἐνθάδε σύλλογον ἀρχὴν γενήσεσθαι τοῖς Ἕλλησι τῆς πρὸς ἀλλήλους φιλίας.	But he, when he had crushed despotism and arrested outrage, founded a contest of bodily strength, a challenge of wealth, and a display of intelligence in the fairest part of Greece, that we might meet together for all these enjoyments alike of our eyes and of our ears, because he judged that our assembly here would be a beginning of mutual amity amongst the Greeks.
ἔστι γὰρ καὶ τὸ ἁπλῶς ἡδὺ τῷ τέλει ὁριστέον καὶ τῷ χρόνῳ.	For absolute pleasantness is a thing to be defined by the End it effects and the time it lasts.
ἐς δὲ τὸ χωρίον, ὃ Κήπους ὀνομάζουσι, καὶ τῆς Ἀφροδίτης τὸν ναὸν οὐδεὶς λεγόμενός σφισίν ἐστι λόγος· οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ ἐς τὴν Ἀφροδίτην, ἣ τοῦ ναοῦ πλησίον ἕστηκε.	Concerning the district called The Gardens, and the temple of Aphrodite, there is no story that is told by them, nor yet about the Aphrodite which stands near the temple.
καὶ εἶπαν οἱ διάκονοι τοῦ βασιλέως Ζητηθήτω τῷ βασιλεῖ κοράσια ἄφθορα καλὰ τῷ εἴδει·	And the servants of the king said, “Let uncorrupt and beautiful maidens be sought for the king.
ἐπιβάλλει γὰρ ἡ σκιὰ τοῦ ὄρους, ὡς ἔοικε, χαλκῷ τινι βοιδίῳ, μῆκος ἀποτείνουσα διὰ τῆς θαλάττης οὐκ ἔλαττον ἑπτακοσίων σταδίων, τὸ κατασκιάζον ὕψος εἶναι διὰ τὴν αἰτίαν ὅτι πολλαπλασίους αἱ τοῦ φωτὸς ἀποστάσεις τῶν σωμάτων τὰς σκιὰς ποιοῦσι.	The mountain which makes the shadow causes it, because the distance of the light renders the shadow of bodies manifoldly greater than the bodies themselves.
πάρεστι γᾶς ὀμφαλὸν προσδρακεῖν αἱμάτων βλοσυρὸν ἀρόμενον ἄγος ἔχειν.	I can see the center-stone of the earth defiled with a terrible pollution of blood.
τοὶ μὲν γὰρ ποτὶ πύργους πανδαμεὶ πανομιλεὶ στείχουσιν. τί γένωμαι;	For against our fortifications some are advancing with all their men, all in formation. Ah, what will become of me?
διὰ τἀργύριον πολεμοῦμεν γάρ;	is gold then the cause of the war?
ἀπολείπει δὲ καὶ τρίτην τινὰ μεταξὺ φύσιν οὐκ ἄψυχον οὐδ’ ἄλογον οὐδ’ ἀκίνητον ἐξ αὑτῆς, ὥσπερ ἔνιοι νομίζουσιν , ἀλλ’ ἀνακειμένην ἀμφοῖν ἐκείναις, ἐφιεμένην δὲ τῆς ἀμείνονος ἀεὶ καὶ ποθοῦσαν καὶ διώκουσαν, ὡς τὰ ἐπιόντα δηλώσει τοῦ λόγου, τὴν Αἰγυπτίων θεολογίαν μάλιστα ταύτῃ τῇ φιλοσοφίᾳ συνοικειοῦντος.	He also leaves a certain third nature in the midst between, which is neither without soul nor without reason, nor void of a self-moving power (as some suppose), but rests upon both of the preceding principles, but yet so as still to affect, desire, and pursue the better of them as I shall make out in the ensuing part of this discourse, in which I design to reconcile the theology of the Egyptians principally with this sort of philosophy.
χώρει πρόβαιν᾽ ἐρρωμένως.	march on, advance boldly and bravely!
ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς ὑποτάσσησθε τοῖς τοιούτοις, καὶ παντὶ τῷ συνεργοῦντι καὶ κοπιῶντι.	that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us.
οὐ μόνον οὖν ἄρα καλόν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀγαθόν ἐστιν.	And we conclude that it is not only honorable, but good also.
Μακάριοι οἱ ἐλεήμονες· ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐλεηθήσονται.	Blessed are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy.
οἱ δ’ ἱερεῖς ἀπέχονται πάντων·	But the priests abstain from all in general.
ᾧ δὴ καὶ μάλιστα αὐτοῦ τὴν διάνοιαν προπεσεῖν τινες ἐν τῷ φόβῳ νομίζοντες ἡγοῦντο οὐδ’ ἂν Πομπήιον κρατήσαντα μεθεῖναι τὴν μοναρχίαν.	In this remark some people thought his real intentions escaped him, involuntarily expressed in a moment of fright, and they inferred that if Pompey had been victorious he would not have laid down the supreme power.
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον αἰτησάμενοι μακρότερα εἰπεῖν καὶ προτάξαντες σφῶν αὐτῶν Ἀστύμαχόν τε τὸν Ἀσωπολάου καὶ Λάκωνα τὸν Αἰειμνήστου πρόξενον ὄντα Λακεδαιμονίων· καὶ ἐπελθόντες ἔλεγον τοιάδε.	The Plataeans asked leave to speak at greater length, and deputed two of their number to represent them; Astymachus, son of Asopolaus, and Lacon, son of Aeimnestus, Proxenus of the Lacedaemonians, who came forward and spoke as follows:—
ἀναχθέντες δὲ Διομήδης καὶ Νέστωρ καὶ Μενέλαος ἅμα, οἱ μὲν εὐπλοοῦσιν, ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος χειμῶνι περιπεσών, τῶν λοιπῶν ἀπολομένων σκαφῶν, πέντε ναυσὶν ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον ἀφικνεῖται.	When they put to sea, Diomedes, Nestor, and Menelaus in company, the two former had a prosperous voyage, but Menelaus was overtaken by a storm, and after losing the rest of his vessels, arrived with five ships in Egypt.
πρῶτον μὲν περὶ Κορίνθου διδαξάτω μέ τις, Βοιωτῶν μὴ συμπολεμούντων, εἰρήνην δὲ ποιουμένων πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους, τίνος ἐστὶν ἡμῖν ἀξία Κόρινθος. ἀναμνήσθητε γάρ, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ὅτε Βοιωτοῖς τὴν συμμαχίαν ἐποιούμεθα, τίνα γνώμην ἔχοντες ταῦτα ἐπράττομεν. οὐχ ὡς ἱκανὴν οὖσαν τὴν Βοιωτῶν δύναμιν μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν γενομένην κοινῇ πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἀμύνασθαι; νῦν δὲ βουλευόμεθα, Βοιωτῶν εἰρήνην ποιουμένων πῶς δυνατοὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις πολεμεῖν ἐσμεν ἄνευ Βοιωτῶν.	first as to corinth. i should like to be informed of the value of corinth to us, if boeotia leaves our ranks and makes peace with sparta. recall the day on which we concluded our alliance with boeotia, gentlemen: recall the assumption on which we acted. we imagined, did we not, that once boeotia joined forces with us we could face the whole world. yet here we are considering how we can continue fighting sparta without her help, now that she is making peace.
ἀφρὸν δὲ ἀποπτύουσι ὥσπερ ἐπὶ τοῖσι μεγάλοισι πνεύμασι ἡ θάλασσα τὴν ἄχνην·	and if along with the humours the spirit be mixed, it appears like the relief of all the former feelings of suffocation. They accordingly spit out foam, as the sea ejects froth in mighty tempests
παρέσται δὲ ὁ δημόσιος καὶ βασανιεῖ ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, ἂν κελεύητε.	The officer shall come in and administer the torture in your presence, gentlemen of the jury, if you so order.
τὸ μὲν οὖν μέγιστον μαρτύριον αὐτὸς εἶπεν, ὅτι οἱ Ἴωνες αἰεί ποτε πολέμιοι τοῖς Δωριεῦσιν εἰσίν.	The best proof of this the speaker himself furnished, when he called the Ionians eternal enemies of the Dorians.
ὁ δὲ Ἀννίβας ὡς ἀπέρρηξεν ἑαυτὸν τοῦ Μαρκέλλου, χρώμενος ὥσπερ λελυμένῳ τῷ στρατεύματι, πᾶσαν ἀδεῶς ἐν κύκλῳ περιϊὼν ἔφλεγε τὴν Ἰταλίαν καὶ κακῶς ἤκουσεν ἐν Ῥώμῃ Μάρκελλος, οἱ δὲ ἐχθροὶ Πουβλίκιον Βίβλον, ἕνα τῶν δημάρχων, ἀνέστησαν ἐπὶ τὴν κατηγορίαν αὐτοῦ, δεινὸν εἰπεῖν ἄνδρα καὶ βίαιον·	But Hannibal, now that he had torn himself away from Marcellus, made free use of his army, and going fearlessly round about, wasted all Italy with fire. Meantime, at Rome, Marcellus was in ill repute, and his enemies incited Publicius Bibulus, one of the tribunes of the people, a powerful speaker and a man of violence, to bring a denunciation against him.
ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς περιστεραὶ ἐπὶ πληρώματα ὑδάτων λελουσμέναι ἐν γάλακτι, καθήμεναι ἐπὶ πληρώματα.	His eyes are like doves on an abundance of water, bathed in milk, sitting on an abundance.
καὶ ἐὰν ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἐὰν κακόν, τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν, οὗ ἡμεῖς ἀποστέλλομέν σε πρὸς αὐτόν, ἀκουσόμεθα, ἵνα βέλτιον ἡμῖν γένηται, ὅτι ἀκουσόμεθα τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν.	And whether good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God ⌊to whom we are sending you⌋, that it might become better for us, for we will listen to the voice of the Lord our God.”
ὥστ’ οὐδὲν προσδεῖται πραγμάτων ἀγῶνας κεκτημένων.	Hence he has no longer any need of things which are not to be won save by labour and conflict.
Καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλεεῖτε διακρινόμενοι·	And on some have compassion, making a distinction;
τὸ δὲ δέρμα μου ἐσκότωται μεγάλως, τὰ δὲ ὀστᾶ μου ἀπὸ καύματος.	And my skin has been darkened greatly, and my bones from burning heat.
καὶ τὸν Μιξολύδιον δὲ τόνον ὅλον προσεξευρῆσθαι λέγεται, καὶ τὸν τῆς ὀρθίου μελῳδίας τρόπον τὸν κατὰ τοὺς ὀρθίους πρός τε τῷ ὀρθίῳ καὶ τὸν σημαντὸν τροχαῖον.	Archilochus also invented the rhythmic composition of the iambic trimeter, the change to rhythms of different character, the melo-dramatic delivery, and the accompaniment proper to each of these.
οἷς ἔδωκεν εἰς διαρπαγὴν Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς προνομεύουσιν αὐτόν. οὐχὶ ὁ θεὸς ᾧ ἡμάρτοσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλοντο ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ πορεύεσθαι οὐδὲ ἀκούειν τοῦ νόμου αὐτοῦ;	by which he gave Jacob and Israel as plunder to those who captured him. Was it not God, against whom they sinned and were unwilling to walk in his ways or to listen to his law?
ἡ γὰρ τοῦ φύσει σπουδαίου ἀρετὴ ἁπλῶς ἀγαθόν, ἡ δὲ τοῦ μὴ ἐκείνῳ. ὁμοίως δὴ ἔχει καὶ τὸ ἡδύ.	consequently the goodness of a thing excellent by nature is good absolutely, but that of a thing not excellent by nature is only good for that thing.The case of the pleasant also, therefore, is similar.
ἐπολιτογραφήθη δὲ ἐν Μιλήτῳ, ὅτε ἦλθε σὺν Νείλεῳ ἐκπεσόντι Φοινίκης·	He was admitted to citizenship at Miletus when he came to that town along with Nileos, who had been expelled from Phoenicia.
Οὐ γὰρ ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα μὴ δυνάμενον συμπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν, πεπειραμένον δὲ κατὰ πάντα καθ' ὁμοιότητα, χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας.	For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.
ὥσπερ οὖν κατηγόρων τὴν ἀντωμοσίαν δεῖ ἀναγνῶναι αὐτῶν·	I must, as it were, read their sworn statement as if they were plaintiffs
χαῖρε, ἄνασσ’, ἥ τις μακάρων τάδε δώμαθ’ ἱκάνεις, Ἄρτεμις ἢ Λητὼ ἠὲ χρυσέη Ἀφροδίτη ἢ Θέμις ἠυγενὴς ἠὲ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη, ἤ πού τις Χαρίτων δεῦρ’ ἤλυθες, αἵτε θεοῖσι πᾶσιν ἑταιρίζουσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι καλέονται, ἤ τις Νυμφάων, αἵτ’ ἄλσεα καλὰ νέμονται ἢ Νυμφῶν, αἳ καλὸν ὄρος τόδε ναιετάουσι καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν, καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα.	Or, maybe, you are one of the Graces come hither, who bear the gods company and are called immortal, or else one of the Nymphs who haunt the pleasant woods, or of those who inhabit this lovely mountain and the springs of rivers and grassy meads.
εἰς δὲ Βαιθὴλ οὐκέτι προσθήσεις τοῦ προφητεῦσαι, ὅτι ἁγίασμα βασιλέως ἐστίν, καὶ οἶκος βασιλείας ἐστίν.	but in Bethel no longer increase prophesying, because it is a sanctuary of the king, and it is a house of the kingdom.”
ἔς τε Λοκροὺς μετὰ ταῦτα ἦλθον, καὶ ὁρμουσῶν αὐτῶν κατέπλευσε μία τῶν ὁλκάδων τῶν ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ἄγουσα Θεσπιῶν ὁπλίτας·	the Syracusan squadron went to Locri, and one of the merchantmen from Peloponnese coming in, while they were at anchor there, carrying Thespian heavy infantry,
θοῦ, Κύριε, φυλακὴν τῷ στόματί μου, καὶ θύραν περιοχῆς περὶ τὰ χείλη μου.	O Lord, set a guard for my mouth and a door of fortification around my lips.
Ἐπειδὴ γὰρ δι' ἀνθρώπου ὁ θάνατος, καὶ δι' ἀνθρώπου ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν.	For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.
οὗτος δὲ ὁ λόγος σημαίνει, τὸ Δίωνα ἐξαίρετον εἶναι, ὅτι οὐκ ἄρχω ἐγὼ τῶν ἐμῶν ἐπιτηδείων·	Now your saying this, that Dion is excepted, implies that I have no control over my friends
ὥσθ’ ἅπασι μὲν βούλεσθαι προσήκει πολλοὺς εἶναι τοὺς ἐκ παιδείας δεινοὺς εἰπεῖν γιγνομένους, μάλιστα δ’ ὑμῖν·	Therefore, it behoves all men to want to have many of their youth engaged in training to become speakers, and you Athenians most of all.
τὰ μὲν γάρ κυριώτατα καὶ μέγιστα πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν πόλεως καὶ ἀρετήν, ἐν τοῖς ἤθεσιν ᾤετο καὶ ταῖς ἀγωγαῖς τῶν πολιτῶν ἐγκατεστοιχειωμένα, μένειν ἀκίνητα καὶ βέβαια, ἔχοντα τὴν προαίρεσιν δεσμὸν ἰσχυρότερον τῆς ἀνάγκης, ἣν ἡ παίδευσις ἐμποιεῖ τοῖς νέοις, νομοθέτου διάθεσιν ἀπεργαζομένη περὶ ἕκαστον αὐτῶν.	For he thought that if the most important and binding principles which conduce to the prosperity and virtue of a city were implanted in the habits and training of its citizens, they would remain unchanged and secure, having a stronger bond than compulsion in the fixed purposes imparted to the young by education, which performs the office of a law-giver for every one of them.
ὁ θεὸς εὖ συνέστησεν αὐτῆς τὴν ὁδόν, αὐτὸς δὲ οἶδεν τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς.	God well contrived its way, and he himself has known its place.
κούρη δ’ Ὠκεανοῦ, Χρυσάορι καρτεροθύμῳ μιχθεῖσ’ ἐν φιλότητι πολυχρύσου Ἀφροδίτης, Καλλιρόη τέκε παῖδα βροτῶν κάρτιστον ἁπάντων, Γηρυονέα, τὸν κτεῖνε βίη Ἡρακληείη βοῶν ἕνεκ’ εἰλιπόδων ἀμφιρρύτῳ εἰν Ἐρυθείῃ.	And the daughter of Ocean, Callirrhoe was joined in the love of rich Aphrodite with stout-hearted Chrysaor and bore a son who was the strongest of all men, Geryones, whom mighty Heracles killed in sea-girt Erythea for the sake of his shambling oxen.
ἔτι καθ᾽ οὓς τρόπους δείκνυται ὅτι ἔστι τὰ εἴδη, κατ᾽ οὐθένα φαίνεται τούτων·	again, not one of the ways in which it is attempted to prove that the forms exist demonstrates their point;
Οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θεὸς νεκρῶν, ἀλλὰ θεὸς ζώντων· ὑμεῖς οὖν πολὺ πλανᾶσθε.	"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken."
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις αὐτὴν μαθήμασιν ἀναπληρούτω καὶ φιλοσοφίαν ἐπιστησάτω παιδαγωγόν· αὕτη γὰρ ἱκανὴ κρῖναι τὸ μουσικῇ πρέπον μέτρον καὶ τὸ χρήσιμον.	let him also adorn it with those other sciences, and make philosophy his tutor, which is sufficient to judge what is iii music decent and useful.
οἱ δ’ ἐν ἄστει ὡσαύτως τὴν ναῦν ἰδόντες καὶ τῆς νίκης περὶ δείλην ἑσπέραν πυθόμενοι ἐς τὰς ὁδοὺς ἐξεπήδων καὶ διενυκτέρευον μετ’ ἀλλήλων, ἡδόμενοι καὶ συμπλεκόμενοι ὡς ἄρτι μὲν ἐλεύθεροι φόβων γεγονότες, ἄρτι δ’ ἄρχοντες ἑτέρων ἀσφαλῶς, ἄρτι δὲ βέβαιον τὴν πόλιν ἔχοντες, καὶ νενικηκότες οἵαν οὔτινα πρότερον ἄλλην νικην.	When the people of Rome saw the ship and heard of the victory early in the evening, they poured into the streets and spent the whole night congratulating and embracing each other like people just now delivered from some great fear, just now confirmed in their world-wide supremacy, just now assured of the permanence of their own city, and winners of such a victory as never before.
πρῶτον μὲν αὐτῶν τούτων, καίπερ ὄντων γενναίων, ἆρ’ οὐκ εἰσί τινες καὶ γίγνονται ἄριστοι;	In the first place, I said, among these themselves, although they are a select breed, do not some prove better than the rest?
ὧν τὰ μὲν τῆς θαλάττης ἐπικεχείρηκεν ἁμωσγέπως ἐξονομάζειν Ὅμηρος ἰοειδέα καλῶν καὶ οἴνοπα πόντον, αὖθις δέ πορφύρεον κῦμα γλαυκήν τ’ ἄλλως θάλασσαν καὶ λευκὴν γαλήνην τὰς δὲ περὶ τὴν γῆν διαφορὰς τῶν ἄλλοτ’ ἄλλως ἐπιφαινομένων χρωμάτων παρῆκεν, ὡς ἀπείρους τὸ πλῆθος οὔσας.	And as for the tincture or colors of the sea, Homer has indeed in some sort endeavored to name and express them, when he sometimes terms the sea violet-colored or red as wine, at other times the waves purple, and again the sea blue, and the calm white. As for the diversities of tinctures and colors appearing upon the earth, he has, I suppose, omitted them, because they are in number infinite. Now it is not probable that the moon has but one superficies all plain and even, as the sea
ἐκ δὲ τούτων τιμᾶν δοκῶν καὶ μεγαλύνειν τὸ ἀξίωμα τῆς ἐκείνων ἀρχῆς, ἐλάνθανεν αὔξων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν καὶ τῇ βασιλείᾳ προστιθέμενος μέγεθος ἐκ τῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν εὐνοίας συγχωρούμενον.	Consequently, while he was thought to be honouring and exalting the dignity of their office, he was unawares increasing his own influence and adding to the power of the king a greatness which was conceded out of good-will towards him.
Αἰτεῖτε, καὶ δοθήσεται ὑμῖν· ζητεῖτε, καὶ εὑρήσετε· κρούετε, καὶ ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν.	" Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
ἐπελθὼν Πατροκλῆς, ἀνὴρ συνετὸς εἶναι δοκῶν καὶ Σελεύκῳ φίλος πιστός, οὐ τὸ τῆς δαπάνης ἔφη πλεῖστον εἶναι τῶν Δημητρίου στρατιωτῶν τρεφομένων, ἀλλ’ ἐνδιατρίβοντα τῇ χώρᾳ Δημήτριον οὐ καλῶς περιορᾶν αὐτόν, ὃς ἀεὶ βιαιότατος ὢν καὶ μεγαλοπραγμονέστατος βασιλέων νῦν ἐν τύχαις γέγονεν αἳ καὶ τοὺς φύσει μετρίους ἐξάγουσι τολμᾶν καὶ ἀδικεῖν.	But Patrocles, a man in repute for wisdom, and a trusted friend of Seleucus, came to him and told him that the expense of maintaining the soldiers of Demetrius was a very small matter, but that it was unwise for him to allow Demetrius to remain in the country, since he had always been the most violent of the kings, and the most given to grand designs, and was now in a state of fortune where even naturally moderate men are led to commit deeds of daring and injustice.
σκεύη ἀποικισμοῦ ποίησον σεαυτῇ, κατοικοῦσα θύγατερ Αἰγύπτου· ὅτι Μέμφις εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἔσται, καὶ κληθήσεται Οὐαί, διὰ τὸ μὴ ὑπάρχειν κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ.	Make implements of exile for yourself, O daughter of Egypt who dwells, for Memphis will become a ruin, and it will be called ‘Woe!’ ⌊because of the lack of people to inhabit it⌋.
Οἱ μὲν οὖν ἱππεῖς ἐξῆλθον σπεύδοντες τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως λεγόμενα ἐπιτελεῖν· ἐξετέθη δὲ τὸ πρόσταγμα καὶ ἐν Σούσοις.	Accordingly, the horsemen went out, hastening to fulfill the orders by the king, and the ordinance was publicized even in Susa.
ἄν τε γὰρ ἐρᾷ, θρασὺς μᾶλλον ἢ δειλός, καὶ ὑπομένει πολλοὺς κινδύνους, ὥσπερ ὁ ἐν Μεταποντίῳ τὸν τύραννον ἀποκτείνας καὶ ὁ ἐν Κρήτῃ μυθολογούμενος·	For if a man is in love he is more daring than cowardly, and endures many dangers, like the man who murdered the tyrant at Metapontium and the person in Crete in the story
κρίνων ἕκαστος τῷ πλησίον βοηθῆσαι καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ, καὶ ἐρεῖ	Each one judging to help his neighbor and his brother will also say,
ἐμὲ δὲ ἐσῆλθεν ἀνάμνησις ὡς Θουκυδίδης ποιήσειεν ἐν τοῖς λόγοις Λοκρῶν τῶν πρὸς τῇ Φωκίδι καὶ ἄλλας πόλεις, ἐν δὲ αὐταῖς εἶναι καὶ Μυονέας.	I happened to remember that Thucydides in his history mentions various cities of the Locrians near Phocis, and among them the Myonians.
ἄξιον δὲ μέμψασθαι τὸν θέντα τὸν νόμον, ὃς ἐναντία τῷ ὅρκῳ τοῦ δήμου καὶ τῆς βουλῆς ἐνομοθέτησεν· ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ ὄμνυτε μηδένα μήτε ἐξελᾶν μήτε δήσειν μήτε ἀποκτενεῖν ἄκριτον, ἐν δὲ τῷδε τῷ καιρῷ οὔτε κατηγορίας γενομένης οὔτε ἀπολογίας ἀποδοθείσης διαψηφισαμένων κρύβδην τὸν ὀστρακισθέντα τοσοῦτον χρόνον δεῖ στερηθῆναι τῆς πόλεως.	Now the legislator responsible for this deserves censure; for the law which he framed violates the oath of the People and Council. Under the terms of that oath you swear to exile no one, to imprison no one, to put no one to death, without trial; whereas on this present occasion, when the person ostracized is to be cut off from his country for so long, no accusation has been made, no defence allowed, and the voting is secret.
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἂν πολλῆς πραγματείας δεήσειεν, ἀλλὰ ταχέως ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐξαναγκάσαιμεν ἐν τοῖς ἡμετέροις καιροῖς ἀλλὰ μὴ τοῖς αὑτῶν ποιήσασθαι τοὺς κινδύνους.	For there would be need of no great effort on our part no, we should quickly force them to give battle, choosing the moment propitious for ourselves and not for them.
πολλαχῇ δ’ ἄν τις λογιζόμενος εὕροι ταύτας τὰς πράξεις μάλιστα λυσιτελούσας ἡμῖν.	You will find, if you weigh the matter carefully, that this undertaking is most desirable for us from many points of view.
Ἔλεγον δὲ τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ παραλαβόντι με ἐκεῖνοι οἱ τὰς ψυχὰς φρουροῦντες τὰς οὔσας ἐν τῷ σκοτεινῷ ἄντρῳ·	And they that kept the souls which were in the dark cave said unto the man that had taken me
τὸ γὰρ ἐξαίφνης τοιόνδε τι ἔοικε σημαίνειν, ὡς ἐξ ἐκείνου μεταβάλλον εἰς ἑκάτερον.	For the instant seems to indicate a something from which there is a change in one direction or the other.
καὶ οἱ μὲν προθύμως ταῦτα ἔπρασσον, οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ξύμμαχοι βραδέως τε ξυνελέγοντο καὶ ἐν καρποῦ ξυγκομιδῇ ἦσαν καὶ ἀρρωστίᾳ τοῦ στρατεύειν.	However, the zeal which they displayed was not imitated by the rest of the confederates, who came in but slowly, being engaged in harvesting their corn and sick of making expeditions.
Ταῦτα τὰ κρίματά μου καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ ὁ νόμος ὃν ἔδωκεν Κύριος ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σεινὰ ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ.	“ ‘These are my judgments and my ordinances and the instruction which the Lord gave between him and between the children of Israel at Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.’ ”
ἐγὼ δέ γ᾽ ἤνυστρον βοὸς καὶ κοιλίαν ὑείαν καταβροχθίσας κᾆτ᾽ ἐπιπιὼν τὸν ζωμὸν ἀναπόνιπτος λαρυγγιῶ τοὺς ῥήτορας καὶ Νικίαν ταράξω.	and i, when i have bolted the tripe of an ox together with a sow's belly and swallowed the broth as well, i am fit, though slobbering with grease, to bellow louder than all orators and to terrify nicias.
ἔτι δὲ Δῆλος ἐκινήθη ὀλίγον πρὸ τούτων, πρότερον οὔπω σεισθεῖσα ἀφ’ οὗ Ἕλληνες μέμνηνται·	Further, some while before this, there was an earthquake at Delos, for the first time in the memory of the Hellenes.
ἐμνήσθην τῶν ἔργων Κυρίου, ὅτι μνησθήσομαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν θαυμασίων σου,	I remembered the works of the Lord, because I will remember your wondrous things from the beginning.
τρίβολοι καὶ παγίδες ἐν ὁδοῖς σκολιαῖς, ὁ δὲ φυλάσσων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχὴν ἀφέξεται αὐτῶν.	Thistles and snares are in crooked ways, but the one who guards his own soul will stay away from them.
καὶ ταῦθ’ ἅμα λέγων ὑπεξῄει βάδην ὡς παραδώσων τινὶ τὸν ἵππον.	and as he spoke, he withdrew slowly, as if he would hand his horse over to somebody.
ἐπανελθὼν δ’ εἰς Ῥώμην Δολοβέλλαν ἔκρινε κακώσεως ἐπαρχίας, καὶ πολλαὶ τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος πόλεων μαρτυρίας αὐτῷ παρέσχον, ὁ μὲν οὖν Δολοβέλλας ἀπέφυγε τὴν δίκην, ὁ δὲ Καῖσαρ ἀμειβόμενος τὴν Ἑλλάδα τῆς προθυμίας συνηγόρευσεν αὐτῇ Πόπλιον Ἀντώνιον διωκούσῃ δωροδοκίας ἐπὶ Λευκούλλου τοῦ Μάρκου Μακεδονίας στρατηγοῦ.	After his return to Rome he impeached Dolabella for maladministration of his province, and many of the cities of Greece supplied him with testimony. Dolabella, it is true, was acquitted, but Caesar, in return for the zealous efforts of the Greeks in his behalf, served as their advocate when they prosecuted Publius Antonius for corruption before Marcus Lucullus, the praetor of Macedonia.
ἴυζε δ᾽ ὀμφὰν οὐρανίαν μέλεα μέλη λιτανὰ θεοῖς·	shriek aloud, with a cry that reaches heaven, strains of supplication to the gods;
ποτὶ γραμμᾷ μὲν αὐτὰν στᾶσε κοσμήσαις τέλος ἔμμεν ἄκρον, εἶπε δ’ ἐν μέσσοις ἀπάγεσθαι, ὃς ἂν πρῶτος θορὼν ἀμφί οἱ ψαύσειε πέπλοις.	He placed her at the goal, when he had arrayed her as the crowning prize, and in their midst he announced that that man should lead her to his home, whoever was the first to leap forward and touch her robes.
οὕτως ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ δαιμόνιον, ὡς δίκαια πράσσουσι, συνεπιλαμβάνει.	So it comes about that the gods favor us because we do what is just.
καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Δαυεὶδ διὰ Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος Οὐκ ἀναβήσει εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν, ἀποστρέφου ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν καὶ παρέσει αὐτοῖς πλησίον τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος.	So David inquired of the Lord and the Lord said, “You must not go up to meet them. Instead you should turn back from them and you will come to them beside the place of weeping.”
διὰ ταῦθ’ ὕστερον Ἀντώνιος Ὁρτήσιον ἐν Φιλίπποις λαβὼν τῷ μνήματι τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ προσέσφαξε.	For this reason, at a later time, when Antony had captured Hortensius at the battle of Philippi, he slew him on the tomb of his brother.
ἀπὸ μάστιγος γλώσσης σε κρύψει, καὶ οὐ μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ κακῶν ἐρχομένων.	He shall hide you from the scourge of a tongue, and you shall not be afraid of evils that come.
Σωσίπολις Ἀντισσαῖος , δεηθείσης τῆς πόλεως χρημάτων, εἰθισμένων αὐτῶν λαμπρῶς ἄγειν Διονύσια, ἐν οἷς ἄλλα τε πολλὰ ἀνήλισκον ἐξ ἐνιαυτοῦ παρασκευάζοντες καὶ ἱερεῖα πολυτελῆ, ὑπογύου δὲ οὔσης ταύτης τῆς ἑορτῆς, ἔπεισεν αὐτοὺς τῷ μὲν Διονύσῳ εὔξασθαι ἐς νέωτα ἀποδώσειν διπλάσια, ταῦτα δὲ συναγαγόντας ἀποδόσθαι.	The city of Antissa had been accustomed to celebrate the festival of Dionysus with great magnificence. Year by year great provision was made for the occasion, and costly sacrifices were prepared. Now one year the city found itself in need of funds
ἑλεῖν δὲ τὰς Ἀθήνας αὐτός φησιν ἐν τοῖς ὑπομνήμασι Μαρτίαις καλάνδαις, ἥτις ἡμέρα μάλιστα συμπίπτει τῇ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ Ἀνθεστηριῶνος μηνός, ἐν ᾧ κατὰ τύχην ὑπομνήματα πολλὰ τοῦ διὰ τὴν ἐπομβρίαν ὀλέθρου καὶ τῆς φθορᾶς ἐκείνης δρῶσιν, ὡς τότε καὶ περὶ τὸν χρόνον ἐκεῖνόν μάλιστα τοῦ κατακλυσμοῦ συμπεσόντος.	He took Athens, as he says himself in his Memoirs, on the Calends of March, a day which corresponds very nearly with the first of the month Anthesterion. In this month, as it happens, the Athenians perform many rites commemorating the destruction and devastation caused by the flood, believing that the ancient deluge occurred at about this time.
Ἕλληνες δὲ οἱ ἐναντία βασιλέως πολεμήσαντες ἀνέθεσαν μὲν Δία ἐς Ὀλυμπίαν χαλκοῦν, ἀνέθεσαν δὲ καὶ ἐς Δελφοὺς Ἀπόλλωνα ἀπὸ ἔργων τῶν ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐπί τε Ἀρτεμισίῳ καὶ ἐν Σαλαμῖνι.	The Greeks who fought against the king, besides dedicating at Olympia a bronze Zeus, dedicated also an Apollo at Delphi, from spoils taken in the naval actions at Artemisium and Salamis.
τὸ πῦρ σου ψυχρὸν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἄπονοι οἱ καταπέλται, καὶ ἀδύνατος ἡ βία σου.	Your fire is cold to us, and your catapult causes no pain, and your force has no strength.
εὐπρεπῆ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου ποιησάμενος αἰτίαν τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἐλευθεροῦν, οὐδὲν δεομένους, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐλευθέρους καὶ αὐτονόμους χάριτι τῇ Ῥωμαίων ἀπὸ Φιλίππου καὶ Μακεδόνων νεωστὶ γεγονότας, διέβη μετὰ δυνάμεως, καὶ σάλον εὐθὺς ἡ Ἑλλὰς εἶχε καὶ μετέωρος ἦν ἐλπίσι διαφθειρομένη βασιλικαῖς ὑπὸ τῶν δημαγωγῶν.	So he crossed into Greece with an army, making the freeing of the Greeks a specious ground for war. This they did not need at all, since they had recently been made free and independent of Philip and the Macedonians by grace of the Romans. Greece was at once a stormy sea of hopes and fears, being corrupted by her demagogues with expectations of royal bounty.
Ζῆνα δέ τις προφρόνως ἐπινίκια κλάζων τεύξεται φρενῶν τὸ πᾶν·	but whoever willingly sings a victory song for zeus, he shall gain wisdom altogether, -
ἑξῆς δὲ τῆς εἰκόνος ταύτης πῦρ καίουσιν ὀνομάζοντες Φορωνέως εἶναι·	Next to this statue is a fire which they keep burning, calling it the fire of Phoroneus.
παυσαμένης δὲ τῆς μάχης εὐθὺς οἱ περὶ τὸν Τεύταμον ἐπρεσβεύοντο περὶ τῆς ἀποσκευῆς.	After the battle was over, Teutamus at once sent an embassy to treat for the baggage.
ἐπεὶ δὲ βοηθήσας τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἀπῄει διὰ Κορίνθου τὴν στρατιὰν ἄγων, ἐνεκάλει Λάχαρτος αὐτῷ πρὶν ἐντυχεῖν τοῖς πολίταις εἰσαγαγόντι τὸ στράτευμα·	After he had given aid to the Lacedaemonians, he was going back home with his forces through the Isthmus of Corinth, when Lachartus upbraided him for having introduced his army before he had conferred with the citizens.
ἅπαντα δὲ ταῦτα μάλιστ’ ἂν εἰδέναι ὅτι γένοιτο, εἰ μὴ ἄνευ τῶν οἰκείων τῶν ἑαυτοῦ τὰς διαθήκας ποιοῖτο, ἀλλὰ πρῶτον μὲν συγγενεῖς παρακαλέσας, ἔπειτα δὲ φράτορας καὶ δημότας, ἔπειτα τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιτηδείων ὅσους δύναιτο πλείστους·	He would be assured that all these intentions would be best effected, not if he made his will without the attestation of any of his friends, but if he summoned first his kinsmen, then the members of his ward and deme, and finally as many as possible of his other acquaintances
Πανύασσις δὲ ὁ Πολυάρχου πεποιηκὼς ἐς Ἡρακλέα ἔπη θυγατέρα Ἀχελῴου τὴν Κασταλίαν φησὶν εἶναι.	But Panyassis, son of Polyarchus, who composed an epic poem on Heracles, says that Castalia was a daughter of Achelous.
σὺ μὲν ὁ Ῥωμαῖος ἐνταῦθα κείμενος, ἐγὼ δ’ ἡ δύστηνος ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ, τοσοῦτο τῆς σῆς μεταλαβοῦσα χώρας μόνον.	thou, the Roman, lying buried here, while I, the hapless woman, lie in Italy, and get only so much of thy country as my portion.
τὸν δὲ Εὔχειρον εἶναι Κορίνθιον, φοιτῆσαι δὲ ὡς Συάδραν τε καὶ Χάρταν Σπαρτιάτας.	Eucheirus, it is said, was a Corinthian, and attended the school of Syadras and Chartas, men of Sparta.
ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐν βάρει σταθμός τις ὡρισμένος ἐστίν·	similarly in the case of gravity there is some definite weight.
καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ἠλειού, καὶ ἰδοὺ πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐνκρυφίας ὀλυρείτης καὶ καψάκης ὕδατος· καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἔπιεν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἐκοιμήθη.	Elijah looked and behold, by his head a loaf of barley and a flask of water. He arose and ate and drank and returned to sleep.
Πρόδηλον γὰρ ὅτι ἐξ Ἰούδα ἀνατέταλκεν ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν, εἰς ἣν φυλὴν οὐδὲν περὶ ἱερωσύνης Μωϋσῆς ἐλάλησεν.	For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ Περικλῆς περὶ τὸν λόγον εὐλαβὴς ἦν, ὥστ’ ἀεὶ πρὸς τὸ βῆμα βαδίζων εὔχετο τοῖς θεοῖς μηδὲ ῥῆμα μηδὲν ἐκπεσεῖν ἄκοντος αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν προκειμένην χρείαν ἀνάρμοστον.	The truth is, however, that even Pericles, with all his gifts, was cautious in his discourse, so that whenever he came forward to speak he prayed the gods that there might not escape him unawares a single word which was unsuited to the matter under discussion.
ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐξῆλθεν ἐστολισμένος τὴν βασιλικὴν στολὴν καὶ στέφανον ἔχων χρυσοῦν καὶ διάδημα βύσσινον πορφυροῦν· ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἐν Σούσοις ἐχάρησαν.	And Mordecai came out adorned in the royal robe, and wearing a golden crown and a diadem made of fine purple linen, and the people in Susa rejoiced when they saw him.
οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον, αἰνέσατε αὐτόν· ἅπαν τὸ σπέρμα Ἰακώβ, δοξάσατε αὐτόν, φοβηθήτωσαν αὐτὸν ἅπαν τὸ σπέρμα Ἰσραήλ.	Those who fear the Lord, praise him all together. Seed of Jacob, glorify him. Let the seed of Israel fear him all together.
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἔκ τινος πληγῆς εἶδεν αὐτῷ καταρρέον αἷμα, δείξας τῇ χειρὶ πρὸς αὐτόν φησι, τουτὶ μὲν αἷμα καὶ οὐκ ἰχὼρ οἷός πέρ τε ῥέει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι.	for, seeing blood running from a wound he had sustained, he pointed to him with his finger and said, See, there is blood and not Ichor which courses in the veins of the blessed gods.
ὡς δ’ ἄν τι μὴ πράξειε παρὰ τὸ τῇ βουλῇ συμφέρον, ἐκέλευεν αὐτῷ συνελέσθαι τῶν τινα πρεσβυτέρων ἔμφρονα, τῆς ἐκείνου νεότητος ἐγκρατῆ παιδαγωγόν.	The Senate laughed at Cicero's ambition, and the relatives of the conspirators especially opposed him, fearing lest Octavius, as consul, should bring the murderers to punishment."
εἰπόντος δὲ ταῦτα τὸν πρῶτον λαχόντα ἔφη εὐθὺς ἐπιόντα τὴν μεγίστην τυραννίδα ἑλέσθαι, καὶ ὑπὸ ἀφροσύνης τε καὶ λαιμαργίας οὐ πάντα ἱκανῶς ἀνασκεψάμενον ἑλέσθαι, ἀλλ’ αὐτὸν λαθεῖν ἐνοῦσαν εἱμαρμένην παίδων αὑτοῦ βρώσεις καὶ ἄλλα κακά· ἐπειδὴ δὲ κατὰ σχολὴν σκέψασθαι, κόπτεσθαί τε καὶ ὀδύρεσθαι τὴν αἵρεσιν, οὐκ ἐμμένοντα τοῖς προρρηθεῖσιν ὑπὸ τοῦ προφήτου·	When the prophet had thus spoken he said that the drawer of the first lot at once sprang to seize the greatest tyranny, and that in his folly and greed he chose it without sufficient examination, and failed to observe that it involved the fate of eating his own children, and other horrors, and that when he inspected it at leisure he beat his breast and bewailed his choice, not abiding by the forewarning of the prophet.
Ἔτι δὲ προσθεὶς Ἰὼβ εἶπεν τῷ προοιμίῳ	And still continuing, Job spoke in parable,
καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ Ἀζαρίας ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἱερεῖς τοῦ κυρίου ὀγδοήκοντα υἱοὶ δυνατοί.	Azariah the priest entered after him, and with him were the priests of the Lord, eighty-four mighty sons.
Καὶ ἴδεν Ἰωναθὰν ὅτι ὁ καιρὸς αὐτῷ συνεργεῖ, καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς Ῥώμην στῆσαι καὶ ἀνανεῶσαι τὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φιλίαν·	And Jonathan saw that the time worked for him and selected men and sent them to Rome to establish and to restore the friendship toward them.
ἀνέστησαν δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς νῦν Ἐορδίας καλουμένης Ἐορδούς, ὧν οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ ἐφθάρησαν, βραχὺ δέ τι αὐτῶν περὶ Φύσκαν κατῴκηται, καὶ ἐξ Ἀλμωπίας Ἄλμωπας.	From Eordia also were driven the Eordians, most of whom perished, though a few of them still live round Physca, and the Almopians from Almopia.
φοβηθήσονταί με ἀκούσαντες τύραννοι φρικτοί, ἐν πλήθει φανοῦμαι ἀγαθὸς καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἀνδρεῖος.	Horrible tyrants will be afraid when they hear of me; I will appear good in the crowd and virtuous in battle.
καὶ προσπεσόντες τρέπουσιν ἅμα μὲν μάχῃ αἰφνιδίῳ, ἅμα δὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τῶν πυλῶν ἀνοιγομένων φοβηθέντων· ᾠήθησαν γὰρ ἀπὸ προειρημένου τινὸς αὐτοῖς τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν γενέσθαι.	The troops thus assaulted were at once routed, partly from the suddenness of the conflict and partly through fear of the gates being opened to the Athenians, with whom they imagined that the attack had been concerted.
ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοί, ὁ θεός, ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοὶ πάντες.	Let the peoples give thanks to you, O God; let all the peoples give thanks to you.
τῶν τε ἐπιτηδείων ἐπεὶ σπάνις ἦν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ διὰ τοὺς ἀφικνουμένους, ἀπηγόρευσε μὴ πωλεῖν σῖτον ἀληλεσμένον μηδὲ μέτρον ἔλασσον ἢ μέδιμνον, μηδὲ τῶν ὑγρῶν μηθὲν ἔλαττον ἢ μετρητήν.	But finding the camp was short of provisions owing to the arrival of reinforcements, he forbade the sale of milled corn, or of any measure less than 1 1/2 bushels of corn or 8 1/2 gallons of wine or oil.
ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῦτό γέ μοι δοκεῖ καλὸν εἶναι, εἴ τις οἷός τ’ εἴη παιδεύειν ἀνθρώπους ὥσπερ Γοργίας τε ὁ Λεοντῖνος καὶ Πρόδικος ὁ Κεῖος καὶ Ἱππίας ὁ Ἠλεῖος.	Although this also seems to me to be a fine thing, if one might be able to teach people, as Gorgias of Leontini and Prodicus of Ceos and Hippias of Elis are.
ἦλθες δὲ ἐπὶ πηγὴν θαλάσσης, ἐν δὲ ἴχνεσιν ἀβύσσου περιεπάτησας;	And did you go into the spring of the sea and walk about among the tracks of the deep?
ὁ γὰρ Κρεώφυλος, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἴσως, ὁ τοῦ Ὁμήρου ἑταῖρος, τοῦ ὀνόματος ἂν γελοιότερος ἔτι πρὸς παιδείαν φανείη, εἰ τὰ λεγόμενα περὶ Ὁμήρου ἀληθῆ.	for Creophylos, Socrates, the friend of Homer, would perhaps be even more ridiculous than his name as a representative of Homeric culture and education, if what is said about Homer is true.
οἶμαι δὲ κἂν τοῦτον, εἴ τις ἐρωτήσειεν αὐτὸν τί δή ποτ’ ἂν ἐποίησεν εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν τύχην ἐκείνῳ καταστάς, οὐκ ἄλλ’ οὐδὲν εἰπεῖν ἢ ὅτι ἐποιήσατ’ ἂν ὅς τις αὐτὸν ἔμελλε ζῶντα θεραπεύσειν καὶ τελευτήσαντα θάψειν·	I think that my opponent, if anyone were to ask him what he would have done in the same circumstances as Menecles, would have nothing to say except that he would have adopted someone who was likely to look after him while he lived and bury him when he died
Ἢ δοκεῖς ὅτι οὐ δύναμαι ἄρτι παρακαλέσαι τὸν πατέρα μου, καὶ παραστήσει μοι πλείους ἢ δώδεκα λεγεῶνας ἀγγέλων;	"Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?
κεῖται δὲ Ὕπνος ἐν τῷ προτέρῳ, καί οἱ πλὴν τῆς κεφαλῆς ἄλλο οὐδὲν ἔτι λείπεται.	In the outer room lies a figure of Sleep, of which nothing remains now except the head.
ἀλλ’ ὁ μὲν γεωμέτρης θεωρεῖ πῶς πρὸς ἀλλήλας ἔχουσιν αἱ γραμμαί, ὁ δ’ ἁρμονικὸς τοὺς φθόγγους, ὁ δ’ ἀστρολογικὸς τὰ ἄστρα καὶ τὸν κόσμον.	But the geometer considers how lines are related to each other, the student of harmony investigates sounds, the astronomer stars and the universe.
ἡνίκα δὲ ἐλάλει Ἀαρὼν πάσῃ συναγωγῇ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ὤφθη ἐν νεφέλῃ.	And whenever Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel and they turned themselves toward the wilderness, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.
αἴτιον δ’ ἦν ὅτι ἐκεῖνος μὲν δυνατὸς ὢν τῷ τε ἀξιώματι καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ χρημάτων τε διαφανῶς ἀδωρότατος γενόμενος κατεῖχε τὸ πλῆθος ἐλευθέρως, καὶ οὐκ ἤγετο μᾶλλον ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἢ αὐτὸς ἦγε, διὰ τὸ μὴ κτώμενος ἐξ οὐ προσηκόντων τὴν δύναμιν πρὸς ἡδονήν τι λέγειν, ἀλλ’ ἔχων ἐπ’ ἀξιώσει καὶ πρὸς ὀργήν τι ἀντειπεῖν.	The causes of this are not far to seek. Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and known integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over the multitude—in short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for as he never sought power by improper means, he was never compelled to flatter them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that he could afford to anger them by contradiction.
καὶ ἐπέταξεν Ἰούδας κηρῦξαι ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ τοῦ παρεμβαλεῖν ἕκαστον ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν τόπῳ.	And Judas ordered a proclamation in the company: Each person should camp in whatever place he was.
καὶ κατάλοιπον χρείας οἴκου θεοῦ ὃ ἂν φανῇ σοι δοῦναι δώσεις ἀπὸ οἴκων γάζης βασιλέως.	And as for the rest of the needs of the house of God, whatever it seems to you to give, give from the houses of the treasury of the king.
ὧν καὶ οὗτος ἐν ὑπομνήμασιν τὰς φωνὰς ἐντεθείσας βασιλεῖ κοινοῦται, καὶ δὴ προστάξαντος εἰς πάντα τόπον καὶ πόλιν καὶ ταῦτα δημοσιοῦται τὰ γράμματα.	He also made a memorandum of their words and communicated it to the Emperor, and moreover at his command published this docmnent also in every place and city.
ᾧ γὰρ τὰ πρῶτα δύο ἐπλεονέκτησεν τῶν ἅψεων εἰς τὸ πλείω εἶναι τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἢ τὰς ἅψεις, τῷ ἴσῳ τούτῳ καὶ ὁ ἔπειτα ἀριθμὸς πᾶς πασῶν τῶν ἅψεων πλεονεκτεῖ·	for every succeeding number of terms exceeds the number of all the contacts just as much as the first two terms exceeded the number of their contacts.
μετὰ δὲ οὐ πολὺν χρόνον τοῦ ἔργου τοῦ πρὸς Ἤλιδι Μακεδόνες καὶ Δημήτριος ὁ Φιλίππου τοῦ Δημητρίου Μεσσήνην καταλαμβάνουσι.	Not long after the affair at Elis, the Macedonians and Demetrius the son of Philip, son of Demetrius, captured Messene.
ταλαντάτη Μίκκα τίς ἐξεκόρησέ σε; [τίς τὴν ἀγαπητὴν παῖδά σοὐξῃρήσατο;	he throws her the cretan robe. ah! unfortunate mica! who has robbed you of your daughter, your beloved child?
ὕπνον τε γίνεσθαι τῶν τῆς ψυχῆς μερῶν τῶν παρ’ ὅλην τὴν σύγκρισιν παρεσπαρμένων ἐγκατεχομένων ἢ διαφορουμένων, εἶτα συμπιπτόντων τοῖς ἐπερεισμοῖς.	that sleep occurs when the parts of the soul which have been scattered all over the composite organism are held fast in it or dispersed, and afterwards collide with one another by their impacts.
καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτήν, καὶ παρεκλήθη Κύριος ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ καὶ εἶπεν τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῷ διαφθείροντι ἐν τῷ λαῷ Πολὺ νῦν, ἄνες τὴν χεῖρά σου· καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἦν παρὰ τῷ ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου.	And the angel of God reached his hand to Jerusalem to destroy it and the Lord relented for the wickedness and said to the angel who was destroying, “Among the people it is enough now. Release your hand.” And the angel of the Lord was before the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
Οὗτος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ῥηθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου, λέγοντος, Φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, Ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν κυρίου· εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ.	For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD; Make His paths straight.' "
ἐπιτραφέντες δὲ αὐτόθι Ἐχέφρων καὶ Πρόμαχος Ἡρακλέους τε ὄντες καὶ τῆς γυναικὸς τῆς Σικανῆς μετέθεντο τῇ Φηγίᾳ τὸ ὄνομα Ψωφῖδα ἀπὸ τῆς μητρός.	Having been brought up here, Echephron and Promachus, the sons of Heracles and the Sicanian woman, changed the name of Phegia to Psophis, the name of their mother.
Τὸν δὲ ἀσθενοῦντα τῇ πίστει προσλαμβάνεσθε, μὴ εἰς διακρίσεις διαλογισμῶν.	Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things.
Καὶ ἔζησεν Ἀρφαξὰδ ἑκατὸν τριάκοντα πέντε ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Καινάν.	And Arpachshad lived one hundred and thirty-five years and begat Kenan.
κατὰ δὲ τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν πυλῶν τῶν Νηιστῶν τὸ μὲν Θέμιδός ἐστιν ἱερὸν καὶ ἄγαλμα λευκοῦ λίθου, τὸ δὲ ἐφεξῆς Μοιρῶν, τὸ δὲ Ἀγοραίου Διός·	Along the road from the Neistan gate are three sanctuaries. There is a sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble
καὶ ἐλυπήθην σφόδρα καθὼς ἤκουσα τὴν κραυγὴν αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς λόγους τούτους.	And I was very distressed as I heard their outcry and these words.
ἐν ὅσῳ μὲν οὖν κατεῖχεν ἐν μυστηρίῳ καὶ διετήρει τὴν σοφὴν αὐτοῦ βουλήν, ἀμελεῖν ἡμῶν καὶ ἀφροντιστεῖν ἐδόκει:	And so long as he kept it in a mystery and guarded his wise counsel, he seemed to neglect us and to be careless
καί σφισιν εἵποντο μὲν ἐς Μακεδονίαν καὶ ἐπὶ Φίλιππον, μετέσχον δὲ καὶ στρατείας ἐς Αἰτωλούς, τρίτα δὲ ὁμοῦ Ῥωμαίοις ἐμαχέσαντο ἐναντία Ἀντιόχου καὶ Σύρων.	They followed the Romans to Macedonia against Philip they took part in the campaign against the Aetolians thirdly they fought side by side with the Romans against the Syrians under Antiochus.
ὅτε τὸν δρομέα Φάυλλον ὢν βούπαις ἔτι εἶλον διώκων λοιδορίας ψήφοιν δυοῖν.	my most daring deed was when, quite a young man still, i prosecuted phayllus, the runner, for defamation, and he was condemned by a majority of two votes.
ταῦτα εἰκάσαι μὲν ἄν τις Ἀσκληπιοῦ τε εἶναι καὶ Ὑγείας, εἶεν δ’ ἂν Τροφώνιος καὶ Ἕρκυνα, ἐπεὶ μηδὲ τοὺς δράκοντας Ἀσκληπιοῦ μᾶλλον ἢ καὶ Τροφωνίου νομίζουσιν ἱεροὺς εἶναι.	One might conjecture the images to be of Asclepius and Health, but they might be Trophonius and Hercyna, because they think that serpents are just as much sacred to Trophonius as to Asclepius.
ἀνὴρ δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, κεἰ στόμαργός ἐστ’ ἄγαν, αἴθων τέτακται λῆμα, Πολυφόντου βία, φερέγγυον φρούρημα, προστατηρίας Ἀρτέμιδος εὐνοίαισι σύν τ’ ἄλλοις θεοῖς.	And against him, even though he is a big talker, a man of fiery spirit, mighty Polyphontes, is stationed, a dependable sentinel with the good will of guardian Artemis and the other gods.
δοκεῖ γάρ μοι, ἔφη, ταύτῃ γε οὐδὲν χαλεπὸν εἶναι καὶ ὅμοια καὶ ἀνόμοια καὶ ἄλλο ὁτιοῦν τὰ ὄντα πάσχοντα ἀποφαίνειν.	Yes, he said, that is because I think that in that way it is quite easy to show that things experience likeness or unlikeness or anything else.
φύσει δὲ ὢν φιλοπόλεμος ὁ Ἀννίβας καὶ οὔ ποτε φέρων ἀργίαν, τότε μάλιστα τῆς ἀπορίας αὐτὸν ἐνοχλούσης ἐξέτασσε συνεχῶς ἐς μάχην, δεδιὼς μὴ οἱ μισθοφόροι μετάθοιντο διὰ τὴν ἀμισθίαν ἢ σκεδασθεῖεν ἐπὶ συλλογὴν ἀγορᾶς.	Hannibal, who was always ready to fight and impatient of idleness, was especially so now because he was troubled lest his supplies should fail, for which reason he continually offered battle. He feared also lest his mercenaries should desert him, as they had not received their pay, or disperse through the country in search of food.
οὐ μόνη δὲ κιθάρα Ἀπόλλωνος, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐλητικῆς καὶ κιθαριστικῆς εὑρετὴς ὁ θεός.	nor was the harp Apollo's invention only, but as a God he was the inventor of all the music both of the flute and harp.
Λειτουργούντων δὲ αὐτῶν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ νηστευόντων, εἶπεν τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον, Ἀφορίσατε δή μοι τὸν Βαρνάβαν καὶ τὸν Σαῦλον εἰς τὸ ἔργον ὃ προσκέκλημαι αὐτούς.	As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
φαίνεται δὲ Ἀρτόντης ὁ Μαρδονίου πλεῖστα μὲν δοὺς Διονυσοφάνει δῶρα ἀνδρὶ Ἐφεσίῳ, δοὺς μέντοι καὶ ἄλλοις Ἰώνων ὡς οὐδὲ ἐκείνοις ἀμελὲς γενόμενον ταφῆναι Μαρδόνιον.	It is admitted that Artontes, son of Mardonius, gave many gifts to Dionysophanes the Ephesian, but also that he gave them to others of the Ionians, in recognition that they too had spent some pains on the burial of Mardonius.
διόπερ ἐζήτει τί ἐστιν ἀρετή, ἀλλ’ οὐ πῶς γίνεται καὶ ἐκ τίνων.	owing to which he used to inquire what virtue is, but not how and from what sources it is produced.
Καὶ προσέθετο ὁ πόλεμος γενέσθαι πρὸς Δαυείδ· καὶ κατίσχυσεν Δαυεὶδ καὶ ἐπολέμησεν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα, καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ.	And the war continued to be against Saul, but David was victorious, and he fought the Philistines and struck down an exceedingly great slaughter among them, and so they fled from his face.
γενομένης δὲ τῆς τροπῆς οὐ βαρείας, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ὑφ’ ἑαυτῶν καὶ τοῦ στασιάζειν ταραχθέντων, αὖθις ὁ Δίων παρεσκευάζετο μάχεσθαι καὶ συνέταττε πείθων καὶ παραθαρρύνων.	He was therefore forced into an engagement, and was worsted. Since, however, the defeat of his men was not severe, but due more to their own seditious disorders than to the enemy, Dion again prepared for battle and drew up his forces, persuading and encouraging them.
οἱ δὲ ὕπατοι μηδὲ θύσαντες ἃ νομίζεται πρὸ πολέμων ἔφυγον. ἦν δὲ καὶ παρ’ αὐτὰ τὰ δεινὰ ζηλωτὸς ἀνὴρ τῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν εὐνοίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅτι πολλῶν τὴν στρατηγίαν μεμφομένων οὐδεὶς ἦν ὁ μισῶν τὸν στρατηγόν, ἀλλὰ πλείονας ἄν τις εὗρε τῶν διὰ τὴν ἐλευθερίαν φευγόντων τοὺς ἀπολιπεῖν Πομπήϊον μὴ δυναμένους.	The consuls also fled, without even making the sacrifices customary before a war. But even amid the actual terrors of the hour Pompey was a man to be envied for the universal good will felt towards him, because, though many blamed his generalship, there was no one who hated the general. Indeed, one would have found that those who fled the city for the sake of liberty were not so numerous as those who did so because they were unable to forsake Pompey.
καὶ ἐς ἐμέ γε ἔτι ὁ θώραξ καὶ τοῦ δόρατος ἦν ἡ αἰχμή.	The breastplate and the head of the spear are still there today.
οἴονται δὲ πρὸς τὰ φῶτα τῆς σελήνης ἔχειν τινὰ λόγον τοῦ Νείλου τὰς ἀναβάσεις.	They moreover believe that the several risings of the river Nile bear a certain proportion to the variations of light in the moon.
Εἶπεν δέ μοι τὸ πνεῦμα συνελθεῖν αὐτοῖς, μηδὲν διακρινόμενον. Ἦλθον δὲ σὺν ἐμοὶ καὶ οἱ ἓξ ἀδελφοὶ οὗτοι, καὶ εἰσήλθομεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἀνδρός·	"Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
Εὐφράνθητι, ἔρημος διψῶσα, ἀγαλλιάσθω ἔρημος καὶ ἀνθείτω ὡς κρίνον,	Rejoice, thirsty deserted land! Let a deserted land rejoice, and let it blossom like a lily.
εὖ γὰρ ἴστε, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, εἰ ἐγὼ πάλαι ἐπεχείρησα πράττειν τὰ πολιτικὰ πράγματα, πάλαι ἂν ἀπολώλη καὶ οὔτ’ ἂν ὑμᾶς ὠφελήκη οὐδὲν οὔτ’ ἂν ἐμαυτόν.	for you may be quite sure, men of Athens, that if I had undertaken to go into politics, I should have been put to death long ago and should have done no good to you or to myself.
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἐγένοντο ἐπὶ τῷ ποταμῷ, ηὗρον καὶ ἐνταῦθα φυλακήν τινα τῶν Συρακοσίων ἀποτειχίζουσάν τε καὶ ἀποσταυροῦσαν τὸν πόρον. καὶ βιασάμενοι αὐτὴν διέβησάν τε τὸν ποταμὸν καὶ ἐχώρουν αὖθις πρὸς ἄλλον ποταμὸν τὸν Ἐρινεόν· ταύτῃ γὰρ οἱ ἡγεμόνες ἐκέλευον.	Arrived at the river, they found there also a Syracusan party engaged in barring the passage of the ford with a wall and a palisade, and forcing this guard, crossed the river and went on to another called the Erineus, according to the advice of their guides.
ὦ βάρβαρ’ ἐξευρόντες Ἕλληνες κακά·	O barbarous ills devised by Greeks!
Τέκνον μου, φεῦγε ἀπὸ παντὸς πονηροῦ καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς ὁμοίου αὐτου.	My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it.
μὴ γίνου ὀργίλος, ὁδηγεῖ γὰρ ἡ ὀργὴ πρὸς τὸν φόνον, μηδὲ ζηλωτὴς μηδὲ ἐπιστικὸς μηδὲ θυμικός· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων φόνοι γεννῶνται.	Be not prone to anger, for anger leads to murder. Be neither jealous, nor quarrelsome, nor of hot temper, for out of all these murders are engendered.
τέκνον μου, μὴ γίνου ἐπιθυμητής, ὁδηγεῖ γὰρ ἡ ἐπιθυμία πρὸς τὴν πορνείαν, μηδὲ αἰσψρολόγος μηδὲ υψηλόφθαλμος· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπαντων μοιχεῖαι γεννῶνται.	My child, be not a lustful one, for lust leads to fornication. Be neither a filthy talker, nor of lofty eye, for out of all these adulteries are engendered.
τέκνον μου, μὴ γίνου οἰωνοσκόκος, ἐπειδὴ ὁδηγεῖ εἰς τὴν εἰδωλολοατρίαν, μηδὲ ἐπαοιδὸς μηδὲ μαθηματικὸς μηδὲ περικαθαίρίαν, μηδὲ θέλε αὐτὰ βλέπειν· ἐκ γὰρ τοῦτων ἁπάντων εἰδωλολατρία γεννᾶται.	My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leads to idolatry. Be neither an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing to took at these things, for out of all these idolatry is engendered.
τέκνον μου, μῃ γίνου ψεύστης, ἐπειδὴ ὁδηγεῖ τὸ ψεῦσμα εἰς τὴν κλοπήν, μηδὲ φιλάργυρος μηδὲ κενόδοξος· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων κλοπαὶ γεννῶνται.	My child, be not a liar, since a lie leads to theft. Be neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, for out of all these thefts are engendered.
τέκνον μου, μὴ γίνου γόγγυσος, ἐπειδὴ ὁδηγεῖ εἰς τὴν βλασφημίαν, μηδὲ αὐθάδης μηδὲ πονηρόφρων· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων βλασφημίαι γεννῶνται.	My child, be not a murmurer, since it leads the way to blasphemy. Be neither self-willed nor evil-minded, for out of all these blasphemies are engendered.
ἴσθι δὲ πραΰς, ἐπεὶ οἱ πραεῖς κληρονομήσουσιν τὴν γῆν.	Rather, be meek, since the meek shall inherit the earth.
γίνου μακρόθυμος καὶ ἐλεήμων καὶ ἄκακος καὶ ἡσύχιος καὶ ἀγαθὸς καὶ τρέμων τοὺς λόγους διὰ παντός, οὓς ἤκουσας.	Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and gentle and good and always trembling at the words which you have heard.
οὐχ ὑψώσεις σεαυτὸν οὐδὲ δώσεις τῇ ψυχῇ σου θράσος. οὐ κολληθήσεται ἡ ψυχή σου μετὰ ὑψηλῶν, ἀλλὰ μετὰ δικαίων καὶ ταπεινῶν ἀναστραφήσῃ.	You shall not exalt yourself, nor give over-confidence to your soul. Your soul shall not be joined with lofty ones, but with just and lowly ones shall it have its intercourse.
τὰ συμβαίνοντά σοι ἐνεργήματα ὡς ἀγαθὰ προσδέξῃ, εἰδὼς ὅτι ἄτερ θεοῦ οὐδὲν γίνεται.	Accept whatever happens to you as good, knowing that apart from God nothing comes to pass.
καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Κύριος τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ πρὸς μὲ καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ στόματός μου, καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς μέ Ἰδοὺ δέδωκα τοὺς λόγους μου εἰς τὸ στόμα σου.	And the Lord stretched forth his hand to me, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words into your mouth.
ἆρ’ οὖν καὶ δυνατώτατος εἶ ἀληθῆ λέγειν περὶ λογισμῶν;	Have you, then, also most power to tell the truth about calculations?
ἀλλὰ μήν που τό γε μεγίστῃ βλάβῃ ὑπερβάλλον μέγιστον ἂν κακὸν εἴη τῶν ὄντων.	But further, I suppose, whatever has an excess of harm in the greatest measure, must be the greatest evil in the world.
τί δὲ εἰ τὰ ἀκοντιστικὰ σοφὸς ἐβούλου γενέσθαι;	And what if you wished to become wise in javelin-throwing?
Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ Πιλάτος, Μήτι ἐγὼ Ἰουδαῖός εἰμι; Τὸ ἔθνος τὸ σὸν καὶ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς παρέδωκάν σε ἐμοί· τί ἐποίησας;	Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?"
Τίμαιος δὲ καὶ Γύλιππον ἀκλεῶς φησι καὶ ἀτίμως ἀποπέμψαι Συρακουσίους, φιλοπλουτίαν αὑτοῦ καὶ ἀπληστίαν ἐν τῇ στρατηγίᾳ κατεγνωκότας.	Furthermore, Timaeus says that even Gylippus was sent away in ignominy and dishonour by the Syracusans, because they found him guilty of avarice and greed while he was their general.
καὶ οἴσει αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ προσάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας πρότερον· καὶ ἀποκνίσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ σφονδύλου καὶ οὐ διελεῖ,	And he shall bring them to the priest, and the priest shall bring the sin-offering first; and the priest shall pinch off the head from the neck, and shall not divide the body.
Τίς ἐγκαλέσει κατὰ ἐκλεκτῶν θεοῦ; Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν·	Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
οἱ δ’ἀσπασάμενοι τὸ εὕρημα καὶ τύχῃ τινὶ θαυμαστῇ κεχρῆσθαι νομίζοντες ἦγον τὸν ἄνδρα σκότους ἤδη, προπέμψαντες ἐξ αὑτῶν τινας ἀγγέλους παρὰ τὸν Ἀντώνιον.	They were delighted with their unexpected prize, and thinking themselves amazingly fortunate, led Lucilius along in the darkness which had now fallen, after sending ahead some messengers to Antony.
ἵπποι τε γὰρ ἐνῆσαν οὐκ ὀλίγοι καὶ πᾶσα μηχανημάτων ἰδέα καὶ βελῶν πλῆθος, ὅπλων δ’ ἀπέκειντο μυριάδες ἑπτὰ τεθησαυρισμένων ἐκ παλαιοῦ,	for there were many horses there, all sorts of engines of war, and a great quantity of missiles, and armour for seventy thousand men had been stored up there for a long time.
πάνυ σοι ἄρα ἄξιον ἀγαπᾶν εἰ τῶν στρατιωτῶν βελτίων εἶ, ἀλλ’ οὐ πρὸς τοὺς τῶν ἀντιπάλων ἡγεμόνας ἀποβλέπειν εἴ ποτε ἐκείνων βελτίων γέγονας, σκοποῦντα καὶ ἀσκοῦντα πρὸς ἐκείνους.	So you think it quite fitting for you to be satisfied if you are better than the soldiers, but neglect to keep your eye on the enemy’s leaders with a view to showing yourself better than they are, or to plan and practise against them!
κατὰ δὲ τὸ γένος καὶ τὰ τοῦ ὁπωσοῦν διακειμένου ὁ ἐγγύτατα γένους ἀναμφισβητήτως λαμβάνει.	but by right of relationship the next-of-kin has an undisputed title to the property of a deceased person, whatever was the state of the latter's faculties.
τὰ δὲ ἐξ ἀρχῆς τῷ Ποσειδῶνι τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦτο Ἀγαμήδης λέγονται καὶ Τροφώνιος ποιῆσαι, δρυῶν ξύλα ἐργασάμενοι καὶ ἁρμόσαντες πρὸς ἄλληλα·	Originally, they say, this sanctuary was built for Poseidon by Agamedes and Trophonius, who worked oak logs and fitted them together.
καὶ εἰσελεύσονται διὰ τῶν πυλῶν τῆς πόλεως ταύτης βασιλεῖς καὶ ἄρχοντες καθήμενοι ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυεὶδ καὶ ἐπιβεβηκότες ἐφ᾽ ἅρμασιν καὶ ἵπποις αὐτῶν, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν, ἄνδρες Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ· καὶ κατοικισθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα,	that there shall enter through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, and riding on their chariots and horses, they, and their princes, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
σύμπλους δὲ γενόμενος, καὶ κρατήσας φύσεως ἐξ ἀνδρὸς μὲν καὶ ταύρου μεμιγμένης, τὴν δ’ ἰσχὺν ἐχούσης οἵαν προσήκει τὴν ἐκ τοιούτων σωμάτων συγκειμένην, τοὺς μὲν παῖδας διασώσας τοῖς γονεῦσιν ἀπέδωκε, τὴν δὲ πόλιν οὕτως ἀνόμου καὶ δεινοῦ καὶ δυσαπαλλάκτου προστάγματος ἠλευθέρωσεν.	Having embarked with them for Crete, he subdued this monster, half-man and half-bull, which possessed strength commensurate with its composite origin, and having rescued the children, he restored them to their parents, and thus freed the city from an obligation so savage, so terrible, and so ineluctable.
ἔτι διὰ τί ἡ εὐδαιμονία οὐκ ἐπαινεῖται;	also why is happiness not praised?
καὶ εἶπεν Σαλωμών Ἐὰν γένηται εἰς υἱὸν δυνάμεως, εἰ πεσεῖται τῶν τριχῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἐὰν κακία εὑρεθῇ ἐν αὐτῷ, θανατωθήσεται.	And Solomon said, If he should be a valiant man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the ground; but if evil be found in him, he shall die.
δυοῖν ὄντοιν ἰδέαιν δόξης, τοῦ μὲν ἀληθινοῦ, ψευδοῦς δὲ τοῦ ἑτέρου, τὴν ἀληθῆ δόξαν ἐπιστήμην ὁρίζῃ;	Assuming that there are two kinds of opinion, one true and the other false, do you define knowledge as the true opinion?
Ἀγανακτήσας δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τοῖς ῥηθεῖσιν ἐκέλευσεν πλάκας πυρῶσαι καὶ στῆσαι αὐτὸν ἐπάνω αὐτῶν ἀνυπόδετον·	And the king was wroth at his words, and commanded to heat iron plates and set him upon them barefoot
Θυσία εἰρηνική μοί ἐστιν· σήμερον ἀποδίδωμι τὰς εὐχάς μου·	I have a peace-offering; today I pay my vows:
καὶ διεμέτρησεν κατέναντι τοῦ οἴκου μῆκος πηχῶν ἑκατόν, καὶ τὰ ἀπόλοιπα καὶ τὰ διορίζοντα καὶ οἱ τοῖχοι αὐτῶν μῆκος πηχῶν ἑκατόν,	And he measured in front of the house a length of a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and the partitions; and the walls thereof were in length a hundred cubits.
παλλεύκων δὲ πέπλων ἀπόμοιρος ἄκληρος ἐτύχθην	and I have neither lot nor portion of pure white ceremonial robes
ἀγαθῆς ζωῆς ἀριθμὸς ἡμερῶν, καὶ ἀγαθὸν ὄνομα εἰς αἰῶνα διαμενεῖ.	A good life has but few days: but a good name endures for ever.
καὶ οἱ πλησίον ἐπεγέλων λέγοντες Οὐκέτι φοβεῖται φονευθῆναι περὶ τοῦ πράγματος τούτου· καὶ ἀπέδρα, καὶ ἰδοὺ πάλιν θάπτει τοὺς νεκρούς.	But my neighbors mocked me, and said, This man is not yet afraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; and yet, behold, he buries the dead again.
καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ ὁ θεὸς ὅτι ἐπορεύθη αὐτός, καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐνδιαβαλεῖν αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβεβήκει ἐπὶ τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ δύο παῖδες αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ.	And God was very angry because he went; and the angel of the Lord rose up to withstand him. Now he had mounted his ass, and his two servants were with him.
πρὸς δὲ καὶ ἡνίκα ἔτι ἦν μετ’ ἀνθρώπων, τιμωρούμενός τε ἄλλους ὑβρίζοντας καὶ μάλιστα ὅσοι θεῶν ἀσεβεῖς ἦσαν, οὐκ ἂν αὐτός γε κατεστήσατο αὑτῷ ναόν τε καὶ ἱέρειαν ὥσπερ δὴ θεός.	Moreover, while he was still among men, punishing them for insolence, and especially such as were impious towards the gods, he would not himself have set up a temple and appointed a priestess to himself, just as though he were a god.
οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ εἰσῆλθον ἐπὶ τοὺς τραυματίας, καὶ διήρπασαν τὴν πόλιν, ἐν ᾗ ἐμίαναν Δείναν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν·	But the sons of Jacob came upon the wounded, and ravaged the city wherein they had defiled Dina their sister.
τὰ δὲ ξόανα Ἀφροδίτης καὶ Ἑρμοῦ, τὸ μὲν Ἐπειοῦ λέγουσιν ἔργον εἶναι, τὸ δὲ Ὑπερμήστρας ἀνάθημα.	As to the wooden images of Aphrodite and Hermes, the one they say was made by Epeus, while the other is a votive offering of Hypermnestra.
καὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς ὁρῶμεν τῆς τε δόξης ταύτης καὶ τῆς ἐπὶ τὸν Πέρσην ἡγεμονίας ἠξιωμένους, οἳ καὶ τὸ ἐν Δελφοῖς ἱερὸν ἠλευθέρωσαν;	And do we not see this glory and the leadership against the Persians bestowed on the same men who liberated the temple of Delphi?
Καθώς, φημί, κύριε, ἀπ̓ ἀρχῆς ἔδειξας:	Even as, Sir, said I, you showed me from the beginning
ὃ δ’ οὖν μέγιστον αὐτῷ καὶ λαμπρότατόν ἐστι τῶν εἰργασμένων, ὁ πρὸς Κάσσιον καὶ Βροῦτον πόλεμος, ἐπὶ τῷ τὴν πατρίδα καὶ τοὺς πολίτας ἀφελέσθαι τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἐπολεμήθη.	Moreover, as regards the greatest and most brilliant of his achievements, namely, the war against Cassius and Brutus, it was to deprive his country and his fellow citizens of their liberty that the war was waged.
τί οὖν; τί περὶ τούτων νῦν καὶ ποῖόν τι πεπονθὼς λέγεις;	Well, what is it about them that you are now alluding to, and what has come over you?
καὶ πάλιν ἐὰν τὸ πονηρὸν μὴ ποιῇς καὶ ἐγκρατεύσῃ ἀπ̓ αὐτοῦ, ζήσῃ τῷ θεῷ, καὶ πάντες ζήσονται τῷ θεῷ, ὅσοι ἐὰν ταύτας τὰς ἐντολὰς φυλάξωσι καὶ πορευθῶσιν ἐν αὐταῖς.	And again, if you do not do that which is wicked, and refrain from it, you shall live to God, and all shall live to God who keep these commandments and walk in them.
πότερον θάλασσά εἰμι ἢ δράκων ὅτι κατέταξας ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ φυλακήν;	Am I a sea, or a serpent, that you have set a watch over me?
μὴ σμικρὸν μόριον ἓν πρὸς μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰ ἀφαιρῶμεν, μηδὲ εἴδους χωρίς·	We must not take a single small part, and set it off against many large ones, nor disregard species in making our division.
καὶ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἑπτὰ λυχνιῶν ὅμοιον υἱῷ ἀνθρώπου, ἐνδεδυμένον ποδήρη, καὶ περιεζωσμένον πρὸς τοῖς μαστοῖς ζώνην χρυσῆν.	and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.
ΑΘ. τίς δὴ τρόπος ἀνθρώποις γίγνοιτ’ ἂν τοῦ βίου, οἷσιν τὰ μὲν ἀναγκαῖα εἴη κατεσκευασμένα μέτρια, τὰ δὲ τῶν τεχνῶν ἄλλοις παραδεδομένα, γεωργίαι δὲ ἐκδεδομέναι δούλοις ἀπαρχὴν τῶν ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἀποτελοῦσιν ἱκανὴν ἀνθρώποις ζῶσι κοσμίως, συσσίτια δὲ κατεσκευασμένα εἴη χωρὶς μὲν τὰ τῶν ἀνδρῶν, ἐγγὺς δ’ ἐχόμενα τὰ τῶν αὐτοῖς οἰκείων, παίδων τε ἅμα θηλειῶν καὶ τῶν μητέρων αὐταῖς,	Ath. What manner of life would men live, supposing that they possessed a moderate supply of all the necessaries, and that they had entrusted all the crafts to other hands, and that their farms were hired out to slaves, and yielded them produce enough for their modest needs? Let us further suppose that they had public mess-rooms—separate rooms for men, and others close by for their households, including the girls and their mothers—
Οἱ δὲ ἕτεροι οἱ παραφέροντες τοὺς λίθους, τίνες εἰσίν; Καὶ αὐτοὶ ἅγιοι ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ: οὗτοι δὲ οἱ ἓξ ὑπερέχοντες αὐτούς εἰσιν: συντελεσθήσεται οὖν ἡ οἰκοδομὴ τοῦ πύργου, καὶ πάντες ὁμοῦ εὐφρανθήσονται κύκλῳ τοῦ πύργου καὶ δοξάσουσιν τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ἐτελέσθη ἡ οἰκοδομὴ τοῦ πύργου.	But who are the others, who are bringing the stones? They also are holy angels of God, but these six are greater than they. Therefore the building of the tower shall be completed, and all shall rejoice together around the tower, and shall glorify God because the building of the tower has been completed.
ἀγαθὸς γάρ ἐστι καὶ διώκει τοὺς λύκους.	he is a good dog, and he chases wolves finely.
Ἔλεγον δέ, Μὴ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ, μήποτε θόρυβος ἔσται τοῦ λαοῦ.	But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people."
Καὶ ἀνέβη ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἀπὸ Γαλγὰλ ἐπὶ τὸν Κλαυθμῶνα καὶ ἐπὶ Βαιθὴλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἀνεβίβασα ὑμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ εἰσήγαγον ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ εἶπα Οὐ διασκεδάσω τὴν διαθήκην μου τὴν μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.	And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weeping, and to Baethel, and to the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus says the Lord, I brought you up out of Egypt, and I brought you into the land which I sware to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant that I have made with you.
πέμπτας τοίνυν, ἃς ἡδονὰς ἔθεμεν ἀλύπους ὁρισάμενοι, καθαρὰς ἐπονομάσαντες τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτῆς, ἐπιστήμαις, τὰς δὲ αἰσθήσεσιν ἑπομένας;	And fifth, those pleasures which we separated and classed as painless, which we called pure pleasures of the soul itself, those which accompany knowledge and, sometimes, perceptions?
Ἀπ' ἐκείνης οὖν τῆς ἡμέρας συνεβουλεύσαντο ἵνα ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτόν.	Then, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death.
ἐγὼ δ’ ὁμολογῶ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πολλοὺς καὶ τῶν προσποιουμένων εἶναι σοφιστῶν ἔχειν τινὰς τὴν φύσιν ταύτην,	I grant you that many men in general and some who pretend to be sophists are of this nature.
Τρώων δ᾽ οἰώθη καὶ Ἀχαιῶν φύλοπις αἰνή: πολλὰ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθ᾽ ἴθυσε μάχη πεδίοιο ἀλλήλων ἰθυνομένων χαλκήρεα δοῦρα μεσσηγὺς Σιμόεντος ἰδὲ Ξάνθοιο ῥοάων. Αἴας δὲ πρῶτος Τελαμώνιος ἕρκος Ἀχαιῶν Τρώων ῥῆξε φάλαγγα, φόως δ᾽ ἑτάροισιν ἔθηκεν, ἄνδρα βαλὼν ὃς ἄριστος ἐνὶ Θρῄκεσσι τέτυκτο υἱὸν Ἐϋσσώρου Ἀκάμαντ᾽ ἠΰν τε μέγαν τε.	So grim the encounter of Achaians and Trojans was left to itself, and the battle veered greatly now one way, now in another, over the plain as they guided their bronze spears at each other in the space between the waters of Xanthos and Simoeis. First Telamonian Aias, that bastion of the Achaians, broke the Trojan battalions and brought light to his own company, striking down the man who was far the best of the Thracians, Akamas, the huge and mighty, the son of Eussoros.
τὸν δὲ ἕνα τί ποιήσωσιν; Ἐπικατάρατος, φησιν, ὁ εἷς. προσέχετε, πῶς ὁ τύπος τοῦ Ἰησοῦ φανεροῦται·	But what are they to do with the other? The other, he says, is accursed. Notice how the type of Jesus is manifested:
Παρνησσὸν νιφόεντα θοοῖς διὰ ποσσὶ περήσας ἵκετο Κασταλίης Ἀχελωΐδος ἄμβροτον ὕδωρ.	—Crossing with swift feet snowy ParnassusHe reached the immortal water of Castalia, daughter of Achelous.
καίτοι Κλεομένης ᾔτει τὴν ἀρχὴν παρὰ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ὡς πολλὰ ποιήσων ἀγαθὰ τὰς πόλεις ἀντὶ τῆς τιμῆς καὶ τῆς προσηγορίας ἐκείνης,	And yet Cleomenes asked the Achaeans for the office, with the promise that he would confer many benefits upon their cities in return for that honour and its title,
ἡ Θρᾷττα προσκαύσασα πρώην τὴν χύτραν - ἐπίσχες οὗτος·	ah! you thracian there, you burnt the stew - pot the other day. wait, wait! this is a fine state of affairs!
βρώματα ἀργυρίου ἀποδώσῃ μοι καὶ φάγομαι, καὶ ὕδωρ ἀργυρίου ἀποδώσῃ μοι καὶ πίομαι· πλὴν ὅτι παρελεύσομαι τοῖς ποσίν,	You shall give me food for money, and I will eat; and you shall give me water for money, and I will drink; I will only go through on my feet:
ἢν μὲν οὖν ἐνταῦθα καταλίπω τὸν λόγον, οἶδ’ ὅτι δόξω τὴν πόλιν ἐλαττοῦν, εἰ Θηβαῖοι μὲν ἕξουσι Θεσπιὰς καὶ Πλαταιὰς καὶ τὰς ἄλλας πόλεις ἃς παρὰ τοὺς ὅρκους κατειλήφασιν, ἡμεῖς δ’ ἔξιμεν μηδεμιᾶς ἀνάγκης οὔσης ἐξ ὧν τυγχάνομεν ἔχοντες·	But if I leave off speaking at this point, I know that I shall appear to put Athens at a disadvantage, if, that is to say, the Thebans are to retain possession of Thespiae and Plataea and the other cities which they have seized contrary to their oaths, while we are to retire, under no compulsion to do so, from the territory which we now hold.
Καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ πρὸς οὐδὲ ἓν ῥῆμα, ὥστε θαυμάζειν τὸν ἡγεμόνα λίαν.	But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
Καὶ ἐποίησεν δώδεκα, ἵνα ὦσιν μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἵνα ἀποστέλλῃ αὐτοὺς κηρύσσειν,	Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,
ἄχρι γὰρ Ἰούδας περίεστιν, ἀδύνατον εἰρήνης τυχεῖν τὰ πράγματα.	For as long as Judas lives, it is not possible that the state should be quiet.
ἡ δὲ κτῆσις χωρὶς τοῦ κλήρου πάντων πᾶσα ἐν τῷ φανερῷ γεγράφθω παρὰ φύλαξιν ἄρχουσιν, οἷς ἂν ὁ νόμος προστάξῃ, ὅπως ἂν αἱ δίκαι περὶ πάντων, ὅσαι εἰς χρήματα, ῥᾴδιαί τε ὦσι καὶ σφόδρα σαφεῖς.	All the property of every man over and above his allotment shall be publicly written out and be in the keeping of the magistrates appointed by law, so that legal rights pertaining to all matters of property may be easy to decide and perfectly clear.
τοὺς μὲν γὰρ ἄλλους ἐκ τῶν λεγομένων κρίνετε, τὴν δὲ τούτου μαρτυρίαν, ὅτι ψευδὴς ἦν, εἶδον οἱ δικάζοντες.	You judge all other defendants by what is said of them, but this man's testimony the jurors themselves saw was false.
ὅπερ ἐμοὶ περὶ πλείστου ἐστὶν ὑμᾶς πεῖσαι.	and it is vitally important for me to convince you of this;
οὐ γὰρ τέμνεσθαι οὔτε μέγεθος πᾶν εἰς μεγέθη, οὔθ᾽ ὁποιασοῦν μονάδας δυάδα εἶναι.	for they deny that every spatial magnitude is divisible into extended magnitudes, or that any two given units make 2.
καὶ οἱ Λευεῖται, Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ἀζανειά, Βαναιοὺ ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἡναδάβ, Καδμιὴλ	And the Levites; Jesus the son of Azania, Banaiu of the sons of Enadad, Cadmiel
οὐδὲ μὴν πρὸ ἀρετῆς ὁπόταν αὖ προτιμᾷ τις κάλλος, τοῦτ’ ἔστιν οὐχ ἕτερον ἢ ἡ τῆς ψυχῆς ὄντως καὶ πάντως ἀτιμία.	Again, when a man honors beauty above goodness, this is nothing else than a literal and total dishonoring of the soul
οἷα δὲ τύραννος ἔμπληκτος ἀεὶ ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν ὀξύρροπος σπουδήν, εὐθὺς ὥρμησεν ἐπὶ τὸν Πλάτωνα, καὶ πᾶσαν μηχανὴν αἴρων, συνέπεισε τοὺς περὶ Ἀρχύταν Πυθαγορικοὺς τῶν ὁμολογουμένων ἀναδόχους γενομένους καλεῖν Πλάτωνα·	And since, like a tyrant, he was always extravagant in his desires and headstrong in all that he undertook, he set out at once to secure Plato, and, leaving no stone unturned, persuaded Archytas and his fellow Pythagoreans to become sureties for his agreements, and to summon Plato
Ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἀποσπάσαντες σταδίους ἐννέα, ποιουμένων τὴν πορίαν ἐπὶ τὸν Τιμόθεον, ἐπέβαλλον Ἄραβες αὐτῷ οὐκ ἐλάττους τῶν πεντακισχιλίων, ἱππεῖς δὲ πεντακόσιοι.	Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.
εἶπον δὲ τούτοις καὶ Κερκυραίων ἅμα παραπλέοντας τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐπιμεληθῆναι, οἳ ἐλῃστεύοντο ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει φυγάδων· καὶ Πελοποννησίων αὐτόσε νῆες ἑξήκοντα παρεπεπλεύκεσαν τοῖς ἐν τῷ ὄρει τιμωροὶ καὶ λιμοῦ ὄντος μεγάλου ἐν τῇ πόλει νομίζοντες κατασχήσειν ῥᾳδίως τὰ πράγματα.	their colleague Pythodorus having already preceded them thither. These had also instructions as they sailed by to look to the Corcyraeans in the town, who were being plundered by the exiles in the mountain. To support these exiles sixty Peloponnesian vessels had lately sailed, it being thought that the famine raging in the city would make it easy for them to reduce it.
αὐτὸς δὲ ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν, καὶ μεμαλάκισται διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν· παιδία εἰρήνης ἡμῶν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, τῷ μώλωπι αὐτοῦ ἡμεῖς ἰάθημεν.	But he was wounded on account of our sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his bruises we were healed.
μὰ τὸν Δἴ οὐδέν γ᾽ ἄλλο πλήν γε καρκίνους·	ye gods! i see nothing but crabs.
εἰ γὰρ αἱ χεῖρες ἃ διανοούμεθα ἑκάστῳ ἡμῶν ὑπουργοῦσιν, ὁ μὲν πατάξας καὶ μὴ ἀποκτείνας τῆς πληγῆς βουλευτὴς ἐγένετο, ὁ δὲ θανασίμως τύπτων τοῦ θανάτου·	if our hands carry out the intentions of each of us, he who struck without killing was the wilful author of the blow alone: the willfull author of the death was he who struck and killed:
ἔπειτ᾽ ἐπαίνεσόν τι τῶν χαλκωμάτων, ὀροφὴν θέασαι, κρεκάδι᾽ αὐλῆς θαύμασον·	then praise some bronze vase, survey the ceiling, admire the awning stretched over the court.
Ὅτε δὲ ἤλθομεν εἰς Ῥώμην, ὁ ἑκατόνταρχος παρέδωκεν τοὺς δεσμίους τῷ στρατοπεδάρχῃ· τῷ δὲ Παύλῳ ἐπετράπη μένειν καθ' ἑαυτόν, σὺν τῷ φυλάσσοντι αὐτὸν στρατιώτῃ.	Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
Ἔφη, Ἐγὼ φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, Εὐθύνατε τὴν ὁδὸν κυρίου, καθὼς εἶπεν Ἠσαΐας ὁ προφήτης.	He said: "I am 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Make straight the way of the LORD," ' as the prophet Isaiah said."
Καὶ ἄλλος ἄγγελος τρίτος ἠκολούθησεν αὐτοῖς, λέγων ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, Εἴ τις προσκυνεῖ τὸ θηρίον καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ λαμβάνει χάραγμα ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου αὐτοῦ, ἢ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ,	Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,
καὶ γὰρ εἰ μὲν ἐπίδειξιν ἐποιούμην, ἐπειρώμην ἂν ἅπαντα τὰ τοιαῦτα διαφεύγειν,	It is true that if I were making an epideictic speech I should try to avoid scrupulously all such repetitions
Ὁ δὲ Χαρίσιος δειπνήσας ἐπέστη αὐτῇ· αὐτὴ δὲ ἐβόα λέγουσα·	But Charisius having dined came upon her, and she cried out, saying
οὔ μοι δοκεῖ χρῆναι ὀργίζεσθαι ὑμᾶς τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ τῶν τετρακοσίων, ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἔργοις ἐνίων. οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἐπιβουλεύσαντες ἦσαν αὐτῶν, οἱ δ’ ἵνα μήτε τὴν πόλιν μηδὲν κακὸν ἐργάσαιντο μήθ’ ὑμῶν μηδένα, ἀλλ’ εὖνοι ὄντες εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον, ὧν εἷς ὢν οὑτοσὶ τυγχάνει Πολύστρατος.	In my opinion it is not the name of the Four Hundred that should incense you, but the actions of some of their number. For there were some who had insidious designs: but the rest were resolved to do no harm either to the city or to any amongst you; they entered the Council-chamber with loyal thoughts, and the defendant, Polystratus, is one of that section.
ἐν τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ ἰόντας ὡς ἀλλήλους πρέσβεις καὶ κήρυκας ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς λόγους, καθ’ ὅτι ἔσται ἡ κατάλυσις τοῦ πολέμου.	during which time ambassadors and heralds should go and come between the two countries to discuss the bases of a pacification.
τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ λέγεται πολλαχῶς, ἕνα μὲν τρόπον τὸ εἶδος καὶ ἡ οὐσία ἑκάστου πράγματος, οἷον καθ᾽ ὃ ἀγαθός, αὐτὸ ἀγαθόν, ἕνα δὲ ἐν ᾧ πρώτῳ πέφυκε γίγνεσθαι, οἷον τὸ χρῶμα ἐν τῇ ἐπιφανείᾳ. τὸ μὲν οὖν πρώτως λεγόμενον καθ᾽ ὃ τὸ εἶδός ἐστι, δευτέρως δὲ ὡς ἡ ὕλη ἑκάστου καὶ τὸ ὑποκείμενον ἑκάστῳ πρῶτον.	" that in virtue of which " has various meanings. ( a ) the form or essence of each individual thing; e. g., that in virtue of which a man is good is " goodness itself." ( b ) the immediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e. g., color is produced in the surface of things. thus " that in virtue of which " in the primary sense is the form, and in the secondary sense, as it were, the matter of each
πρέσβειρα πεντήκοντα Κωπᾴδων κορᾶν, ἔκβαθι τῶδε κἠπιχάριτται τῷ ξένῳ.	come, thou, the eldest of my fifty copaic virgins, come and complete the joy of our host.
τῶν τε πάντων ὁμοίως ἐπακτῶν ἐδεῖτο ἡ πόλις, καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ πόλις εἶναι φρούριον κατέστη.	everything the city required had to be imported from abroad, and instead of a city it became a fortress.
οὐκ οὖν δεινόν, εἰ ὑπὸ μὲν τούτων διὰ τοῦτ᾽ ἂν ἀπωλόμην, ὅτι εἰς τὴν πόλιν οὐδὲν ἥμαρτον, ὥσπερ καὶ ἑτέρους ἀπέκτειναν, ἐν ὑμῖν δὲ κρινόμενος, οὓς οὐδὲν κακὸν πεποίηκα, οὐ σωθήσομαι;	then will it not be a travesty of justice if a man whom the thirty would have put to death, as they did others, for failing to commit any act of disloyalty to athens, is not to be acquitted when tried before you whom he refused to wrong?
ἐπίστασθε δὲ ὅτι ἡ μὲν ἀρχὴ τῶν κρατούντων τῆς θαλάττης, τῶν δὲ χρημάτων βασιλεὺς ταμίας, τὰ δὲ τῶν Ἑλλήνων σώματα τῶν δαπανᾶσθαι δυναμένων, ναῦς δὲ πολλὰς μὲν αὐτὸς κέκτηται, πολλὰς δ’ ὁ τύραννος τῆς Σικελίας.	you are aware that empire is for those who command the sea, that the King has control of the money, that the Greeks are in thrall to those who are able to spend it, that our master possesses many ships, and that the despot of Sicily has many also.
Σπονδαὶ μὲν μένουσιν, ἀπιοῦσι δὲ ἢ προϊοῦσι πόλεμος.	A truce if we stay; if we leave or advance, war.
καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς εἰσιέναι καὶ εἶδεν τὸν Ἐλιάβ, καὶ εἶπεν Ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου χριστὸς αὐτοῦ.	And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτ’ ἔγημεν ἐκ Σερίφου παρ’ ἀνθρώπων πολὺ πλείονος ἀξίων ἢ κατὰ τὴν αὑτῶν πόλιν, ἐξ ἧς ἐγένετο Σώπολις καὶ Θρασύλοχος καὶ θυγάτηρ ἡ νῦν ἐμοὶ συνοικοῦσα.	After this he married a woman of Seriphos, belonging to a family of greater consequence than might be expected of a native of their island. Of this marriage were born Sopolis, Thrasylochus, and a daughter, who is my wife.
Θράσυλλος μὲν οὖν τούτους μόνους παῖδας γνησίους καταλιπὼν καὶ κληρονόμους τῶν αὑτοῦ καταστήσας τὸν βίον ἐτελεύτησεν.	These were the only legitimate children left by Thrasyllus and he made these his heirs when he died.
γενομένης δὲ τῆς διώξεως μακρᾶς καὶ δι’ ὅλης νυκτός, οὐ μόνον κτείνοντες αὐτούς, ἀλλὰ καὶ ζωγροῦντες καὶ χρήματα καὶ λείαν ἄγοντες καὶ φέροντες ἀπεῖπον οἱ Ῥωμαῖοι.	The pursuit was long and lasted through the whole night, and the Romans were worn out, not only with killing their enemies, but also with taking prisoners and getting all sorts of booty.
κατοίκων ἐν Γαλαάμ, ἐν Βασὰμ καὶ ἐν ταῖς κώμαις αὐτῶν καὶ πάντα τὰ περίχωρα Γεριὰμ ἕως ἐξόδου.	They lived in Galaad, in Basan, and in their villages, and in all the country round about Saron to the border.
Λέγεται δὲ καὶ πρῶτος κρέασιν ἀσκῆσαι ἀθλητάς, καὶ πρῶτόν γ’ Εὐρυμένην, καθά φησι Φαβωρῖνος ἐν τρίτῳ τῶν Ἀπομνημονευμάτων, τῶν πρότερον ἰσχάσι ξηραῖς καὶ τυροῖς ὑγροῖς, ἀλλὰ καὶ πυροῖς σωμασκούντων αὐτούς, καθάπερ ὁ αὐτὸς Φαβωρῖνος ἐν ὀγδόῃ Παντοδαπῆς ἱστορίας φησίν.	He is also said to have been the first to diet athletes on meat, trying first with Eurymenes— so we learn from Favorinus in the third book of his Memorabilia—whereas in former times they had trained on dried figs, on butter, and even on wheatmeal, as we are told by the same Favorinus in the eighth book of his Miscellaneous History.
κἀκόπτετ᾽ ἐγκεκυφώς, κἄκλαε κἀκεκράγει Σεβῖνον ὅστις ἐστὶν ἁναφλύστιος.	beats his breast and bends down low weeping and wailing for sebinos, the anaphlystian.
πᾶν ζῷον ἀγαπᾷ τὸ ὅμοιον αὐτῷ, καὶ πᾶς ἄνθρωπος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ·	Every beast loves his like, and every man loves his neighbor.
πολλὰ γὰρ ἐπάσχομεν πρίν ποτ᾽ ἐπὶ σοῦ γλυκέα κἀδάπανα καὶ φίλα. τοῖς ἀγροίκοισιν γὰρ ἦσθα χῖδρα καὶ σωτηρία.	when far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me pine with regret. from thee came all blessings. oh! much desired peace! thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the earth. under thy rule we had a thousand delicious enjoyments at our beck; thou wert the husbandman's wheaten cake and his safeguard.
Τότε ἐξεπορεύετο πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἱεροσόλυμα καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου·	Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him
ἡ γὰρ τύχη καὶ αὐτοὶ οὗτοι ἠνάγκασαν ἐμοὶ πρὸς τούτους αὐτοὺς τὸν ἀγῶνα καταστῆναι, οὓς εἰκὸς ἦν τῷ μὲν τεθνεῶτι τιμωροὺς γενέσθαι, τῷ δ’ ἐπεξιόντι βοηθούς. νῦν δὲ τούτων τἀναντία γεγένηται· αὐτοὶ γὰρ οὗτοι καθεστᾶσιν ἀντίδικοι καὶ φονῆς, ὡς καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ ἡ γραφὴ λέγει.	Circumstances for which the defence have only themselves to blame have made it necessary that my charge should be directed against them, and them alone. One would have expected them to seek vengeance for the dead and support the prosecution; but as it is, the opposite is the case; they are themselves my opponents and the murderers, as both I and my indictment state.
καὶ στραφήσονται αὐτῆς αἱ φάραγγες εἰς πίσσαν, καὶ ἡ γῆ αὐτῆς εἰς θεῖον· καὶ ἔσται ἡ γῆ αὐτῆς ὡς πίσσα καιομένη	And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and her land into sulphur; and her land shall be as pitch burning night and day;
πότερον οὖν δὴ ῥᾴδιον τυγχάνει τὸ γνῶναι ἑαυτόν, καί τις ἦν φαῦλος ὁ τοῦτο ἀναθεὶς εἰς τὸν ἐν Πυθοῖ νεών, ἢ χαλεπόν τι καὶ οὐχὶ παντός;	Well, and is it an easy thing to know oneself, and was it a mere scamp who inscribed these words on the temple at Delphi or is it a hard thing, and not a task for anybody?
Λούκουλλος δὲ τάγμα μὲν αὐτόθεν ἔχων συντεταγμένον ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ διέβαινεν εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν ἐκεῖ δὲ τὴν ἄλλην παρέλαβε δύναμιν, πάντων μὲν πάλαι τρυφαῖς διεφθορότων καὶ πλεονεξίαις, τῶν δὲ Φιμβριανῶν λεγομένων καὶ διὰ συνήθειαν ἀναρχίας δυσμεταχειρίστων γεγονότων.	With a legion which he had raised himself in Italy, Lucullus crossed into Asia, and there assumed command of the rest of the Roman forces. All these had long been spoiled by habits of luxury and greed, and the Fimbrians, as they were called, had become unmanageable, through long lack of discipline.
τούτοις καὶ μάλιστα ἐς τοὺς Πισαίους οἰκεῖα ἦν, καὶ οἰκιστὴν Δυσποντέα γενέσθαι σφίσιν Οἰνομάου παῖδα ἐμνημόνευον.	The list were closely related to the people of Pisa, and it was a tradition of theirs that their founder had been Dysponteus the son of Oenomaus.
καί γε σκηνὰς κτήσεων, τοὺς Ἀμαζονεῖς, ἐξέκοψαν, καὶ ἔλαβον πρόβατα πολλὰ καὶ καμήλους, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ.	Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
τοὺς μὲν θεατὰς εἰδέναι μ᾽ ὃς εἴμ᾽ ἐγώ, τοὺς δ᾽ αὖ χορευτὰς ἠλιθίους παρεστάναι, ὅπως ἂν αὐτοὺς ῥηματίοις σκιμαλίσω.	the audience will know well who i am, but the chorus will be fools enough not to, and i shall dupe' em with my subtle phrases.
καλῶς γέ μου τὸν υἱὸν ὦ Στιλβωνίδη εὑρὼν ἀπιόντ᾽ ἀπὸ γυμνασίου λελουμένον οὐκ ἔκυσας, οὐ προσεῖπας, οὐ προσηγάγου, οὐκ ὠρχιπέδισας, ὢν ἐμοὶ πατρικὸς φίλος. ὦ δειλακρίων σὺ τῶν κακῶν οἵων ἐρᾷς. ἀτὰρ ἔστι γ᾽ ὁποίαν λέγετον εὐδαίμων πόλις παρὰ τὴν ἐρυθρὰν θάλατταν. οἴμοι μηδαμῶς ἡμῖν παρὰ τὴν θάλατταν, ἵν᾽ ἀνακύψεται κλητῆρ᾽ ἄγουσ᾽ ἕωθεν ἡ Σαλαμινία.	is this well done, stilbonides? you met my son coming from the bath after the gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor kissed him, nor took him with you, nor ever once felt his balls. would anyone call you an old friend of mine?" ah! wag, i see you are fond of suffering. but there is a city of delights such as you want. it's on the red sea. oh, no. not a sea - port, where some fine morning the salaminian
ἀφελοῦ τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, παρῆλθεν γάρ· ὑβριστὴς ὅστις τὰ ἀλλότρια λυμαίνεται.	Take away the man's garment, (for a scorner has passed by) whoever lays waste another's goods.
καὶ ἐξηγάγοσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ εἰσηγάγοσαν αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐν μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ ἔριψεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ μνῆμα υἱῶν λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.	and they brought him thence, and brought him into the king; and he struck him with the sword, and cast him into the sepulchre of the children of his people.
‘ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, δι’ ὀλίγου μὲν ἡ παραίνεσις γίγνεται, τὸ ἴσον δὲ πρός γε τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας δύναται καὶ ὑπόμνησιν μᾶλλον ἔχει ἢ ἐπικέλευσιν.	Athenians, I shall only say a few words to you, but brave men require no more, and they are addressed more to your understanding than to your courage.
Ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα· ἀνάγκη γάρ μοι ἐπίκειται· οὐαὶ δέ μοι ἐστίν, ἐὰν μὴ εὐαγγελίζωμαι.	For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!
τί δέ; σὺ ἡμῖν, ὦ Νικία, σύμφῃς περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν τὴν αὐτὴν ἐπιστήμην καὶ ἐσομένων καὶ γιγνομένων καὶ γεγονότων ἐπαΐειν;	Well now, do you agree with us, Nicias, that the same knowledge has comprehension of the same things, whether future, present, or past?
ταῦθ’ ὁ Κάτων ἐνθυμούμενος ἀπῄει, καὶ τὸν αὑτοῦ πάλιν οἶκον ἐφορῶν καὶ χωρία καὶ θεράποντας καὶ δίαιταν ἐπέτεινε τὴν αὐτουργίαν καὶ περιέκοπτε τὴν πολυτέλειαν.	Cato would go away with his mind full of these things, and on viewing again his own house and lands and servants and mode of life, would increase the labours of his hands and lop off his extravagancies.
καὶ Μωσῆς ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ θεοῦ· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ λέγων Τάδε ἐρεῖς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἀναγγελεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ	And Moses went up to the mount of God, and God called him out of the mountain, saying, These things shall you say to the house of Jacob, and you shall report them to the children of Israel.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς μέ Κάθες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ χωνευτήριον, καὶ σκέψομαι εἰ δόκιμόν ἐστιν, ὃν τρόπον ἐδοκιμάσθη ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν. καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς τριάκοντα ἀργυροῦς καὶ ἐνέβαλον αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου εἰς τὸ χωνευτήριον.	And the Lord said to me, Drop them into the furnace, and I will see if it is good metal, as I was proved for their sakes. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the furnace in the house of the Lord.
Λακεδαιμονίων δὲ ἀπαντικρὺ τούτων ἀναθήματά ἐστιν ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων Διόσκουροι καὶ Ζεὺς καὶ Ἀπόλλων τε καὶ Ἄρτεμις, ἐπὶ δὲ αὐτοῖς Ποσειδῶν τε καὶ Λύσανδρος ὁ Ἀριστοκρίτου στεφανούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος, Ἀγίας τε ὃς τῷ Λυσάνδρῳ τότε ἐμαντεύετο καὶ Ἕρμων ὁ τὴν ναῦν τοῦ Λυσάνδρου τὴν στρατηγίδα κυβερνῶν.	Opposite these are offerings of the Lacedaemonians from spoils of the Athenians: the Dioscuri, Zeus, Apollo, Artemis, and beside these Poseidon, Lysander, son of Aristocritus, represented as being crowned by Poseidon, Agias, soothsayer to Lysander on the occasion of his victory, and Hermon, who steered his flag-ship.
Σωδάμας δὲ ἐξ Ἀσσοῦ τῆς ἐν τῇ Τρῳάδι, κειμένης δὲ ὑπὸ τῇ Ἴδῃ, πρῶτος Αἰολέων τῶν ταύτῃ στάδιον Ὀλυμπίασιν ἐνίκησεν ἐν παισίν.	a city at the foot of Ida, was the first of the Aeolians in this district to win at Olympia the foot-race for boys.
παιδίων μὲν ὄντων φάναι χρὴ εἶναι τοῦτο τὸ ἀγγεῖον κενόν, ἀντὶ δὲ τῶν ὀρνίθων ἐπιστήμας νοῆσαι·	We must assume that while we are children this receptacle is empty, and we must understand that the birds represent the varieties of knowledge.
εἰ δὲ ἐλθεῖν ἐς Ἦλιν διὰ τοῦ πεδίου θελήσειας, σταδίους μὲν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν ἐς Λετρίνους ἕξεις, ὀγδοήκοντα δὲ ἐκ Λετρίνων καὶ ἑκατὸν ἐπὶ Ἦλιν.	If you wish to go to Elis through the plain, you will travel one hundred and twenty stades to Letrini, and one hundred and eighty from Letrini to Elis.
Ἀφίημί σετὴν καλλίστην μου σύζυγον, ἣν πρώην πολλῷ χρόνῳ εὗρον καὶ ἀνεπάην·	I leave you, my fairest consort, whom long since I found and rested in you.
εἴησαν δ’ ἄν οὗτοι Κρῆτες.	These Greeks must, I suppose, have been Cretans.
μειράκιον ἐκ τῆς παιδικῆς ὥρας ἑταιροῦν ἀνειληφὼς ὁ Λεύκιος ἀεὶ Περὶ αὑτὸν εἶχε καὶ συνεπήγετο στρατηγῶν ἐπὶ τιμῆς καὶ δυνάμεως τοσαύτης ὅσην οὐδεὶς εἶχε τῶν πρώτων παρ’ αὐτῷ φίλων καὶ οἰκείων, ἐτύγχανε μὲν οὖν ἡγούμενος ὑπατικῆς ἐπαρχίας·	There was a youth who, ever since his boyhood, had been the favourite of Lucius. This youth Lucius kept ever about him, and took with him on his campaigns in greater honour and power than any one of his nearest friends and kinsmen had.
ὁ δὲ Λεύκιος ἀντιφιλοφρονούμενος ἀλλὰ τούτου γε χάριν, εἶπε, μή μοι κατάκεισο λυπούμενος, ἐγὼ γὰρ ἰάσομαι.	Well, for that matter, said Lucius, don’t lie there with any grudge against me, for I will cure it.
καὶ κελεύσας ἕνα τῶν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ κατακρίτων εἰς τὸ συμπόσιον ἀχθῆναι καὶ τὸν ὑπηρέτην ἔχοντα πέλεκυν παραστῆναι, πάλιν ἠρώτησε τὸν ἐρώμενον, εἰ βούλεται τυπτόμενον θεάσασθαι.	Thereupon he commanded that one of the men who were lying under sentence of death be brought to the banquet, and that a lictor with an axe stand by his side. Then he asked his beloved if he wished to see the man smitten.
φήσαντος δὲ βούλεσθαι, προσέταξεν ἀποκόψαι τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸν τράχηλον.	The youth said he did, and Lucius ordered the man’s head to be cut off.
οἱ μὲν οὖν πλεῖστοι ταῦτα ἱστοροῦσι, καὶ ὅ γε Κικέρων αὑτὸν τὸν Κάτωνα διηγούμενον ἐν τῷ Περὶ γήρως διαλόγῳ πεποίηκεν ὁ δὲ Λίβιος αὐτόμολον εἶναί φησι Γαλάτην τὸν ἀναιρεθέντα, τὸν δὲ Λεύκιον οὐ δι’ ὑπηρέτου κτεῖναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλ’ αὑτὸν ἰδίᾳ χειρί, καὶ ταῦτα ἐν λόγῳ γεγράφθαι Κάτωνος.	This is the version which most writers give of the affair, and so Cicero has represented Cato himself as telling the story in his dialogue On Old Age. But Livy says the victim was a Gallic deserter, and that Lucius did not have the man slain by a lictor, but smote him with his own hand, and that this is the version of the story in a speech of Cato’s.
ἐκβληθέντος οὖν τοῦ Λευκίου τῆς βουλῆς ὑπὸ τοῦ Κάτωνος, ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὑτοῦ βαρέως φέρων ἐπὶ τὸν δῆμον κατέφυγε καὶ τὴν αἰτίαν ἐκέλευεν εἰπεῖν τὸν Κάτωνα τῆς ἐκβολῆς. εἰπόντος δὲ καὶ διηγησαμένου τὸ συμπόσιον ἐπεχείρει μὲν ὁ Λεύκιος ἀρνεῖσθαι, προκαλουμένου δὲ τοῦ Κάτωνος εἰς ὁρισμὸν ἀνεδύετο.	On the expulsion of Lucius from the Senate by Cato, his brother was greatly indignant, and appealed to the people, urging that Cato state his reasons for the expulsion. Cato did so, narrating the incident of the banquet. Lucius attempted to make denial, but when Cato challenged him to a formal trial of the case with a wager of money upon it, he declined.
καὶ τότε μὲν ἄξια παθεῖν κατεγνώσθη· θέας δ’ οὔσης ἐν θεάτρῳ τὴν ὑπατικὴν χώραν παρελθὼν καὶ πορρωτάτω που καθεσθεὶς οἶκτον ἔσχε παρὰ τῷ δήμῳ, καὶ βοῶντες ἠνάγκασαν αὑτὸν μετελθεῖν, ὡς ἦν δυνατὸν ἐπανορθούμενοι καὶ θεραπεύοντες τὸ γεγενημένον.	But once when a spectacle was given in the theatre, he passed along by the senatorial seats, and took his place as far away from them as he could. Then the people took pity upon him and shouted till they had forced him to change his seat, thus rectifying, as far as was possible, and alleviating the situation.
ἄλλον δὲ βουλῆς ἐξέβαλεν ὑπατεύσειν ἐπίδοξον ὄντα, Μανίλλιον, ὅτι τὴν αὑτοῦ γυναῖκα μεθ’ ἡμέραν ὁρώσης τῆς θυγατρὸς κατεφίλησεν. αὑτῷ δ’ ἔφη τὴν γυναῖκα μηδέποτε πλὴν βροντῆς μεγάλης γενομένης περιπλακῆναι, καὶ μετὰ παιδιᾶς εἰπεῖν αὑτὸν ὡς μακάριός ἐστι τοῦ Διὸς βροντῶντος.	Cato expelled another senator who was thought to have good prospects for the consulship, namely, Manilius, because he embraced his wife in open day before the eyes of his daughter. For his own part, he said, he never embraced his wife unless it thundered loudly and it was a pleasantry of his to remark that he was a happy man when it thundered.
ἤνεγκε δέ τινα τῷ Κάτωνι καὶ Λεύκιος ὁ Σκηπίωνος ἀδελφὸς ἐπίφθονον αἰτίαν, θριαμβικὸς ἀνὴρ ἀφαιρεθεὶς ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὸν ἵππον· ἔδοξε γὰρ οἷον ἐφυβρίζων Ἀφρικανῷ Σκηπίωνι τεθνηκότι τοῦτο ποιῆσαι.	Cato was rather bitterly censured for his treatment of Lucius, the brother of Scipio, whom, though he had achieved the honour of a triumph, he expelled from the equestrian order. He was thought to have done this as an insult to the memory of Scipio Africanus.
τοὺς δὲ πλείστους ἠνίασε μάλιστά τῇ περικοπῇ τῆς πολυτελείας, ἣν ἄντικρυς μὲν ἀφελέσθαι, νενοσηκότων ἤδη καὶ διεφθαρμένων ὑπ’ αὐτῆς τῶν πολλῶν, ἀδύνατον ἦν, κύκλῳ δὲ περιϊὼν ἠνάγκαζεν ἐσθῆτος,	But he was most obnoxious to the majority of his enemies because he lopped off extravagance in living. This could not be done away with outright, since most of the people were already infected and corrupted by it, and so he took a roundabout way.
ὀχήματος, κόσμου γυναικείου, σκευῶν τῶν περὶ δίαιταν, ὧν ἑκάστου τὸ τίμημα δραχμὰς χιλίας καὶ πεντακοσίας ὑπερέβαλλεν, ἀποτιμᾶσθαι τὴν ἀξίαν εἰς τὸ δεκαπλάσιον, βουλόμενος ἀπὸ μειζόνων τιμημάτων αὐτοῖς μείζονας καὶ τὰς εἰσφορὰς εἶναι, καὶ προσετίμησε τρεῖς χαλκοῦς πρὸς τοῖς χιλίοις, ὅπως βαρυνόμενοι ταῖς ἐπιβολαῖς καὶ Τοὺς εὐσταλεῖς καὶ λιτοὺς ὁρῶντες ἀπὸ τῶν ἴσων ἐλάττονα τελοῦντας εἰς τὸ δημόσιον ἀπαγορεύωσιν.	He had all apparel, equipages, jewellery, furniture and plate, the value of which in any case exceeded fifteen hundred drachmas, assessed at ten times its worth, wishing by means of larger assessments to make the owners’ taxes also larger. Then he laid a tax of three on every thousand asses thus assessed, in order that such property holders, burdened by their charges, and seeing that people of equal wealth who led modest and simple lives paid less into the public treasury, might desist from their extravagance.
Σκόπας δὲ ὁ Θετταλὸς αἰτουμένου τινὸς τῶν φίλων παρ’ αὐτοῦ τι τοιοῦτον, ὃ μὴ σφόδρα ἦν χρήσιμον ἐκείνῳ, καὶ λέγοντος, ὡς οὐδὲν αἰτεῖ τῶν ἀναγκαίων καὶ χρησίμων καὶ μὴν ἐγὼ τούτοις εἶπεν, εὐδαίμων καὶ πλούσιός εἰμι, τοῖς ἀχρήστοις καὶ περιττοῖς.	Scopas the Thessalian, when one of his friends asked for something of his which was of no great service to him, with the remark that he asked for nothing that was necessary and useful, replied And yet my wealth and happiness are based on just such useless and superfluous things.
οὕτως ὁ τοῦ πλούτου ζῆλος οὐδενὶ πάθει φυσικῷ συνημμένος ἐκ τῆς ὀχλώδους καὶ θυραίου δόξης ἐπεισόδιός ἐστιν.	Thus the desire for wealth is no natural adjunct of the soul, but is imposed upon it by the false opinions of the outside world.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ τῶν ἐγκαλούντων ἐλάχιστα φροντίζων ὁ Κάτων ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐπέτεινεν, ἀποκόπτων μὲν ὀχετοὺς, οἷς τὸ παραρρέον δημόσιον ὕδωρ ὑπολαμβάνοντες ἀπῆγον εἰς οἰκίας ἰδίας καὶ κήπους, ἀνατρέπων δὲ καὶ καταβάλλων ὅσα προὔβαινεν εἰς τὸ δημόσιον οἰκοδομήματα, συστέλλων δὲ τοῖς μισθοῖς τὰς ἐργολαβίας, τὰ δὲ τέλη ταῖς πράσεσιν ἐπὶ τὰς ἐσχάτας ἐλαύνων τιμάς.	However, Cato paid not the slightest heed to his accusers, but grew still more strict. He cut off the pipes by which people conveyed part of the public water supply into their private houses and gardens he upset and demolished all buildings that encroached on public land he reduced the cost of public works to the lowest, and forced the rent of public lands to the highest possible figure.
φαίνεται δὲ θαυμαστῶς ἀποδεξάμενος αὐτοῦ τὴν τιμητείαν ὁ δῆμος, ἀνδριάντα γοῦν ἀναθεὶς ἐν τῷ ναῷ τῆς Ὑγιείας ἐπέγραψεν οὐ τὰς στρατηγίας οὐδὲ τὸν θρίαμβον τὸν Κάτωνος, ἀλλ’, ὡς ἄν τις μεταφράσειε τὴν ἐπιγραφήν, ὅτι τὴν Ῥωμαίων πολιτείαν ἐγκεκλιμένην καὶ ῥέπουσαν ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον τιμητὴς γενόμενος χρησταῖς ἀγωγαῖς καὶ σώφροσιν ἐθισμοῖς καὶ διδασκαλίαις εἰς ὀρθὸν αὖθις ἀποκατέστησε	Still, it appears that the people approved of his censorship to an amazing extent. At any rate, after erecting a statue to his honour in the temple of Health, they commemorated in the inscription upon it, not the military commands nor the triumph of Cato, but, as the inscription may be translated, the fact that when the Roman state was tottering to its fall, he was made censor, and by helpful guidance, wise restraints, and sound teachings, restored it again.
καίτοι πρότερον αὐτὸς κατεγέλα τῶν ἀγαπώντων τὰ τοιαῦτα, καὶ λανθάνειν αὐτοὺς ἔλεγεν ἐπὶ χαλκέων καὶ ζωγράφων ἔργοις μέγα φρονοῦντας, αὐτοῦ δὲ καλλίστας εἰκόνας ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς περιφέρειν τοὺς πολίτας πρὸς δὲ τοὺς θαυμάζοντας, ὅτι πολλῶν ἀδόξων ἀνδριάντας ἐχόντων ἐκεῖνος οὐκ ἔχει μᾶλλον γὰρ, ἔφη, βούλομαι ζητεῖσθαι, διὰ τί μου ἀνδριὰς οὐ κεῖται ἢ διὰ τί κεῖται	And yet, before this time he used to laugh at those who delighted in such honours, saying that, although they knew it not, their pride was based simply on the work of statuaries and painters, whereas his own images, of the most exquisite workmanship, were borne about in the hearts of his fellow citizens. And to those who expressed their amazement that many men of no fame had statues, while he had none, he used to say I would much rather have men ask why I have no statue, than why I have one.
τὸ δ’ ὅλον οὐδ’ ἐπαινούμενον ἠξίου τὸν ἀγαθὸν πολίτην ὑπομένειν, εἰ μὴ τοῦτο χρησίμως γίνοιτο τῷ κοινῷ.	In short, he thought a good citizen should not even allow himself to be praised, unless such praise was beneficial to the commonwealth.
καίτοι πλεῖστα πάντων ἑαυτὸν ἐγκεκωμίακεν, ὅς γε καὶ τοὺς ἁμαρτάνοντάς τι περὶ τὸν βίον, εἶτ’ ἐλεγχομένους λέγειν φησίν, ὡς οὐκ ἄξιον ἐγκαλεῖν αὐτοῖς·	And yet of all men he has heaped most praises upon himself. He tells us that men of self-indulgent lives, when rebuked for it, used to say We ought not to be blamed
ἀφορᾶν δὲ τὴν βουλὴν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἐπισφαλεστάτοις καιροῖς ὥσπερ ἐν πλῷ πρὸς κυβερνήτην, καὶ πολλάκις μὴ παρόντος ὑπερτίθεσθαι τὰ πλείστης ἄξια σπουδῆς, ἃ δὴ παρὰ τῶν ἄλλων αὐτῷ μαρτυρεῖται· μέγα γὰρ ἔσχεν ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ διὰ τὸν βίον καὶ διὰ τὸν λόγον καὶ διὰ τὸ γῆρας ἀξίωμα.	Also that those who imitated some of his practices and did it clumsily, were called left-handed Catos. Also that the Senate looked to him in the most dangerous crises as seafarers to their helmsman, and often, if he was not present, postponed its most serious business. These boasts of his are confirmed, it is true, by other witnesses, for he had great authority in the city, alike for his life, his eloquence, and his age.
γέγονε δὲ καὶ πατὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ περὶ γυναῖκα χρηστὸς ἀνὴρ καὶ χρηματιστὴς οὐκ εὐκαταφρόνητος οὐδ’ ὥς τι μικρὸν ἢ φαῦλον ἐν παρέργῳ μεταχειρισάμενος τὴν τοιαύτην ἐπιμέλειαν.	XX, He was also a good father, a considerate husband, and a household manager of no mean talent, nor did he give only a fitful attention to this, as a matter of little or no importance.
ὅθεν οἴομαι δεῖν καὶ περὶ τούτων ὅσα καλῶς ἔχει διελθεῖν γυναῖκα μὲν εὐγενεστέραν ἢ πλουσιωτέραν ἔγημεν, ἡγούμενος ὁμοίως μὲν ἀμφοτέρας ἔχειν βάρος καὶ φρόνημα, τὰς δὲ γενναίας αἰδουμένας τὰ αἰσχρὰ μᾶλλον ὑπηκόους εἶναι πρός τὰ καλὰ τοῖς γεγαμηκόσι.	Therefore I think I ought to give suitable instances of his conduct in these relations. He married a wife who was of gentler birth than she was rich, thinking that, although the rich and the high-born may be alike given to pride, still, women of high birth have such a horror of what is disgraceful that they are more obedient to their husbands in all that is honourable.
τὸν δὲ τύπτοντα γαμετὴν ἢ παῖδα τοῖς ἁγιωτάτοις ἔλεγεν ἱεροῖς προσφέρειν τὰς χεῖρας, ἐν ἐπαίνῳ δὲ μείζονι τίθεσθαι τὸ γαμέτην ἀγαθὸν ἢ τὸ μέγαν εἶναι συγκλητικόν ἐπεὶ καὶ Σωκράτους οὐδὲν ἄλλο θαυμάζειν τοῦ παλαιοῦ πλὴν ὅτι γυναικὶ χαλεπῇ καὶ παισὶν ἀποπλήκτοις χρώμενος ἐπιεικῶς καὶ πρᾴως διετέλεσε, γενομένου δὲ τοῦ παιδὸς οὐδὲν ἦν ἔργον οὕτως ἀναγκαῖον, εἰ μή τι δημόσιον, ὡς μὴ παρεῖναι τῇ γυναικὶ λουούσῃ τὸ βρέφος καὶ σπαργανούσῃ.	He used to say that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a great senator, nay, there was nothing else to admire in Socrates of old except that he was always kind and gentle in his intercourse with a shrewish wife and stupid sons. After the birth of his son, no business could be so urgent, unless it had a public character, as to prevent him from being present when his wife bathed and swaddled the babe.
αὐτὴ γὰρ ἔτρεφεν ἰδίῳ γάλακτι· πολλάκις δὲ καὶ τὰ τῶν δούλων παιδάρια τῷ μαστῷ προσιεμένη κατεσκεύαζεν εὔνοιαν ἐκ τῆς συντροφίας πρός τὸν υἱόν.	For the mother nursed it herself, and often gave suck also to the infants of her slaves, that so they might come to cherish a brotherly affection for her son.
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἤρξατο συνιέναι, παραλαβὼν αὐτὸς ἐδίδασκε γράμματα, καίτοι χαρίεντα δοῦλον εἶχε γραμματιστὴν ὄνομα Χίλωνα, πολλοὺς διδάσκοντα παῖδας.	As soon as the boy showed signs of understanding, his father took him under his own charge and taught him to read, although he had an accomplished slave, Chilo by name, who was a schoolteacher, and taught many boys.
καὶ τὰς ἱστορίας δὲ συγγράψαι φησὶν αὐτὸς ἰδίᾳ χειρὶ καὶ μεγάλοις γράμμασιν, ὅπως οἴκοθεν ὑπάρχοι τῷ παιδὶ πρός ἐμπειρίαν τῶν παλαιῶν καὶ πατρίων ὠφελεῖσθαι τὰ δ’ αἰσχρὰ τῶν ῥημάτων οὐχ ἧττον εὐλαβεῖσθαι τοῦ παιδὸς παρόντος ἢ τῶν ἱερῶν παρθένων, ἃς Ἑστιάδας καλοῦσι συλλούσασθαι δὲ μηδέποτε.	His History of Rome, as he tells us himself, he wrote out with his own hand and in large characters, that his son might have in his own home an aid to acquaintance with his country’s ancient traditions. He declares that his son’s presence put him on his guard against indecencies of speech as much as that of the so-called Vestal Virgins, and that he never bathed with him.
καὶ τοῦτο κοινὸν ἔοικε Ῥωμαίων ἔθος εἶναι· καὶ γὰρ πενθεροὶ γαμβροῖς ἐφυλάττοντο συλλούεσθαι, δυσωπούμενοι τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν καὶ γύμνωσιν.	This, indeed, would seem to have been a general custom with the Romans, for even fathers-in-law avoided bathing with their sons-in-law, because they were ashamed to uncover their nakedness.
εἶτα μέντοι παρ’ Ἑλλήνων τὸ γυμνοῦσθαι μαθόντες, αὐτοὶ πάλιν τοῦ καὶ μετὰ γυναικῶν τοῦτο πράσσειν ἀναπεπλήκασι τοὺς Ἕλληνας.	Afterwards, however, when they had learned from the Greeks their freedom in going naked, they in their turn infected the Greeks with the practice even when women were present.
οὕτω δὲ καλὸν ἔργον εἰς ἀρετὴν τῷ Κάτωνι πλάττοντι καὶ δημιουργοῦντι τὸν υἱόν, ἐπεὶ τὰ τῆς προθυμίας ἦν ἄμεμπτα καὶ δι’ εὐφυΐαν ὑπήκουεν ἡ ψυχή, τὸ δὲ σῶμα μαλακώτερον ἐφαίνετο τοῦ πονεῖν, ὑπανῆκεν αὐτῷ τὸ σύντονον ἄγαν καὶ κεκολασμένον τῆς διαίτης.	So Cato wrought at the fair task of moulding and fashioning his son to virtue, finding his zeal blameless, and his spirit answering to his good natural parts. But since his body was rather too delicate to endure much hardship, he relaxed somewhat in his favour the excessive rigidity and austerity of his own mode of life.
ὁ δέ, ὁ δέ, καίπερ οὕτως ἔχων, ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς ἦν ἐν ταῖς στρατείαις, καὶ τὴν πρός Περσέα μάχην ἠγωνίσατο λαμπρῶς Παύλου στρατηγοῦντος.	But his son, although thus delicate, made a sturdy soldier, and fought brilliantly under Paulus Aemilius in the battle against Perseus.
εἶτα μέντοι τοῦ ξίφους ἐκκρουσθέντος ὑπὸ πληγῆς ἢ δι’ ὑγρότητα τῆς χειρὸς ἐξολισθόντος ἀχθεσθεὶς τρέπεται πρός τινας τῶν συνήθων, καὶ παραλαβὼν ἐκείνους αὖθις εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους ἐνέβαλε.	On that occasion his sword either was smitten from his hand or slipped from his moist grasp. Distressed at this mishap, he turned to some of his companions for aid, and supported by them rushed again into the thick of the enemy.
πολλῷ δ’ ἀγῶνι καὶ βίᾳ μεγάλῃ διαφωτίσας τὸν τόπον ἀνεῦρε μόγις ἐν πολλοῖς σάγμασιν ὅπλων καὶ σώμασι νεκρῶν ὁμοῦ φίλων τε καὶ πολεμίων κατασεσωρευμένων.	After a long and furious struggle, he succeeded in clearing the place, and found the sword at last among the many heaps of arms and dead bodies where friends and foes alike lay piled upon one another.
ἐφ’ ᾧ καὶ Παῦλος ὁ στρατηγὸς ἠγάσθη τὸ μειράκιον, καὶ Κάτωνος αὐτοῦ φέρεταί τις ἐπιστολὴ πρός τὸν υἱόν ὑπερφυῶς ἐπαινοῦντος τὴν περὶ τὸ ξίφος φιλοτιμίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ σπουδήν.	Paulus, his commander, admired the young man’s exploit, and there is still extant a letter written by Cato himself to his son, in which he heaps extravagant praise upon him for this honourable zeal in recovering his sword.
ὕστερον δὲ καὶ Παύλου θυγατέρα Τερτίαν ἔγημεν ὁ νεανίας, ἀδελφὴν Σκηπίωνος, οὐχ ἧττον ἤδη δι’ αὑτὸν ἢ τὸν πατέρα καταμιγνύμενος εἰς γένος τηλικοῦτον.	The young man afterwards married Tertia, a daughter of Paulus and a sister of the younger Scipio, and his admission into such a family was due no less to himself than to his father.
ἡ μὲν οὖν περὶ τὸν υἱὸν ἐπιμέλεια τοῦ Κάτωνος ἄξιον ἔσχεν τέλος.	Thus Cato’s careful attention to the education of his son bore worthy fruit.
οἰκέτας δὲ πολλοὺς ἐκτᾶτο, τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ὠνούμενος μάλιστα τοὺς μικροὺς καὶ δυναμένους ἔτι τροφὴν καὶ παίδευσιν ὡς σκύλακας ἢ πώλους ἐνεγκεῖν.	He owned many domestics, and usually bought those prisoners of war who were young and still capable of being reared and trained like whelps or colts.
τούτων οὐδεὶς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς οἰκίαν ἑτέραν, εἰ μὴ πέμψαντος αὐτοῦ Κάτωνος ἢ τῆς γυναικός. ὁ δ’ ἐρωτηθεὶς, τί πράττοι Κάτων, οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνετο πλὴν ἀγνοεῖν.	Not one of his slaves ever entered another man’s house unless sent thither by Cato or his wife, and when such an one was asked what Cato was doing, he always answered that he did not know.
ἔδει δὲ ἢ πράττειν τι τῶν ἀναγκαίων οἴκοι τὸν δοῦλον ἢ καθεύδειν καὶ σφόδρα τοῖς κοιμωμένοις ὁ Κάτων ἔχαιρε, πρᾳοτέρους τε τῶν ἐγρηγορότων νομίζων καὶ πρὸς ὁτιοῦν βελτίονας χρῆσθαι τῶν δεομένων ὕπνου τοὺς ἀπολελαυκότας, οἰόμενος δὲ τὰ μέγιστα ῥᾳδιουργεῖν ἀφροδισίων ἕνεκα τοὺς δούλους ἔταξεν ὡρισμένου νομίσματος ὁμιλεῖν ταῖς θεραπαινίσιν, ἑτέρᾳ δὲ γυναικὶ μηδένα πλησιάζειν.	A slave of his was expected either to be busy about the house, or to be asleep, and he was very partial to the sleepy ones. He thought these gentler than the wakeful ones, and that those who had enjoyed the gift of sleep were better for any kind of service than those who lacked it. In the belief that his slaves were led into most mischief by their sexual passions, he stipulated that the males should consort with the females at a fixed price, but should never approach any other woman.
ἐν ἀρχῇ μὲν οὖν ἔτι πένης ὢν καὶ στρατευόμενος πρὸς οὐδὲν ἐδυσκόλαινε τῶν περὶ δίαιταν, ἀλλ’ αἴσχιστον ἀπέφαινε διὰ γαστέρα πρὸς οἰκέτην ζυγομαχεῖν.	At the outset, when he was still poor and in military service, he found no fault at all with what was served up to him, declaring that it was shameful for a man to quarrel with a domestic over food and drink.
ὕστερον δὲ τῶν πραγμάτων ἐπιδιδόντων ποιούμενος ἑστιάσεις φίλων καὶ συναρχόντων ἐκόλαζεν εὐθὺς μετὰ τὸ δεῖπνον ἱμάντι τοὺς ἀμελέστερον ὑπουργήσαντας ὁτιοῦν ἢ σκευάσαντας.	But afterwards, when his circumstances were improved and he used to entertain his friends and colleagues at table, no sooner was the dinner over than he would flog those slaves who had been remiss at all in preparing or serving it.
ἀεὶ δέ τινα στάσιν ἔχειν τοὺς δούλους ἐμηχανᾶτο καὶ διαφορὰν πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ὑπονοῶν τὴν ὁμόνοιαν αὐτῶν καὶ δεδοικώς.	He was always contriving that his slaves should have feuds and dissensions among themselves harmony among them made him suspicious and fearful of them.
τοὺς δ’ ἄξιον εἰργάσθαι τι θανάτου δόξαντας ἐδικαίου κριθέντας ἐν τοῖς οἰκέταις πᾶσιν ἀποθνῄσκειν, εἰ καταγνωσθεῖεν.	He had those who were suspected of some capital offence brought to trial before all their fellow servants, and, if convicted, put to death.
ἁπτόμενος δὲ συντονώτερον πορισμοῦ τὴν μὲν γεωργίαν μᾶλλον ἡγεῖτο διαγωγὴν ἢ πρόσοδον, εἰς δ’ ἀσφαλῆ πράγματα καὶ βέβαια κατατιθέμενος τὰς ἀφορμάς ἐκτᾶτο λίμνας, ὕδατα θερμά, τόπους κναφεῦσιν ἀνειμένους, ἔργα πίσσια, χώραν ἔχουσαν αὐτοφυεῖς νομὰς καὶ ὕλας, ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτῷ χρήματα προσῄει πολλὰ μηδ’ ὑπὸ τοῦ Διός, ὥς φησὶν αὐτός, βλαβῆναι δυναμένων.	However, as he applied himself more strenuously to money-getting, he came to regard agriculture as more entertaining than profitable, and invested his capital in business that was safe and sure. He bought ponds, hot springs, districts given over to fullers, pitch factories, land with natural pasture and forest, all of which brought him in large profits, and could not, to use his own phrase, be ruined by Jupiter.
ἐχρήσατο δὲ καὶ τῷ διαβεβλημένῳ μάλιστα τῶν δανεισμῶν ἐπὶ ναυτικοῖς τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον, ἐκέλευε τοὺς δανειζομένους ἐπὶ κοινωνίᾳ πολλοὺς παρακαλεῖν, γενομένων δὲ πεντήκοντα καὶ πλοίων τοσούτων αὐτὸς εἶχε μίαν μερίδα διὰ Κουϊντίωνος ἀπελευθέρου τοῖς δανειζομένοις συμπραγ ματ ευ ο μὲν ου καὶ συμπλέοντος. ἦν δ’ οὖν οὐκ εἰς ἅπαν ὁ κίνδυνος, ἀλλ’ εἰς μέρος μικρὸν ἐπὶ κέρδεσι μεγάλοις.	He used to loan money also in the most disreputable of all ways, namely, on ships, and his method was as follows. He required his borrowers to form a large company, and when there were fifty partners and as many ships for his security, he took one share in the company himself, and was represented by Quintio, a freedman of his, who accompanied his clients in all their ventures.
ἐδίδου δὲ καὶ τῶν οἰκετῶν τοῖς βουλομένοις ἀργύριον οἱ δ’ ἐωνοῦντο παῖδας, εἶτα τούτους ἀσκήσαντες καὶ διδάξαντες ἀναλώμασι τοῦ Κάτωνος μετ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀπεδίδοντο. πολλοὺς δὲ καὶ κατεῖχεν ὁ Κάτων, ὅσην ὁ πλείστην διδοὺς ἐωνεῖτο τιμὴν ὑπολογιζόμενος.	In this way his entire security was not imperilled, but only a small part of it, and his profits were large. He used to lend money also to those of his slaves who wished it, and they would buy boys with it, and after training and teaching them for a year, at Cato’s expense, would sell them again. Many of these boys Cato would retain for himself, reckoning to the credit of the slave the highest price bid for his boy.
προτρέπων δὲ τὸν υἱὸν ἐπὶ ταῦτα φησὶν οὐκ ἀνδρός, ἀλλὰ χήρας γυναικὸς εἶναι τὸ μειῶσαί τι τῶν ὑπαρχόντων.	He tried to incite his son also to such economies, by saying that it was not the part of a man, but of a widow woman, to lessen his substance.
ἐκεῖνο δ’ ἤδη σφοδρότερον τοῦ Κάτωνος, ὅτι θαυμαστὸν ἄνδρα καὶ θεῖον εἰπεῖν ἐτόλμησε πρὸς δόξαν, ὃς ἀπολείπει πλέον ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ὃ προσέθηκεν οὗ παρέλαβεν.	But that surely was too vehement a speech of Cato’s, when he went so far as to say that a man was to be admired and glorified like a god if the final inventory of his property showed that he had added to it more than he had inherited.
ἤδη δὲ αὐτοῦ γέροντος γεγονότος πρέσβεις Ἀθήνηθεν ἦλθον εἰς Ῥώμην οἱ περὶ Καρνεάδην τὸν Ἀκαδημαϊκὸν καὶ Διογένη τὸν Στωικὸν φιλόσοφον, καταδίκην τινὰ παραιτησόμενοι τοῦ δήμου τῶν Ἀθηναίων, ἣν ἐρήμην ὦφλον Ὠρωπίων μὲν διωξάντων, Σικυωνίων δὲ καταψηφισαμένων, τίμημα ταλάντων πεντακοσίων ἔχουσαν.	When he was now well on in years, there came as ambassadors from Athens to Rome, Carneades the Academic, and Diogenes the Stoic philosopher, to beg the reversal of a certain decision against the Athenian people, which imposed upon them a fine of five hundred talents. The people of Oropus had brought the suit, the Athenians had let the case go by default, and the Sicyonians had pronounced judgment against them.
εὐθὺς οὖν οἱ φιλολογώτατοι τῶν νεανίσκων ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἵεντο, καὶ συνῆσαν ἀκροώμενοι καὶ θαυμάζοντες αὐτούς, μάλιστα δ’ ἡ Καρνεάδου χάρις, ἧς δύναμίς τε πλείστη καὶ δόξα τῆς δυνάμεως οὐκ ἀποδέουσα, μεγάλων ἐπιλαβομένη καὶ φιλανθρώπων ἀκροατηρίων ὡς πνεῦμα τὴν πόλιν ἠχῆς ἐνέπλησε.	Upon the arrival of these philosophers, the most studious of the city’s youth hastened to wait upon them, and became their devoted and admiring listeners. The charm of Carneades especially, which had boundless power, and a fame not inferior to its power, won large and sympathetic audiences and filled the city, like a rushing mighty wind, with the noise of his praises.
καὶ λόγος κατεῖχεν, ὡς ἀνὴρ Ἕλλην εἰς ἔκπληξιν ὑπερφυὴς πάντα κηλῶν καὶ χειρούμενος ἔρωτα δεινὸν ἐμβέβληκε τοῖς νέοις, ὑφ’ οὗ τῶν ἄλλων ἡδονῶν καὶ διατριβῶν ἐκπεσόντες ἐνθουσιῶσι περὶ φιλοσοφίαν.	Report spread far and wide that a Greek of amazing talent, who disarmed all opposition by the magic of his eloquence, had infused a tremendous passion into the youth of the city, in consequence of which they forsook their other pleasures and pursuits and were possessed about philosophy.
ταῦτα τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἤρεσκε Ῥωμαίοις γινόμενα, καὶ τὰ μειράκια παιδείας Ἑλληνικῆς μεταλαμβάνοντα καὶ συνόντα θαυμαζομένοις ἀνδράσιν ἡδέως ἑώρων·	The other Romans were pleased at this, and glad to see their young men lay hold of Greek culture and consort with such admirable men.
ὁ δὲ Κάτων ἐξ ἀρχῆς τε τοῦ ζήλου τῶν λόγων παραρρέοντος εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἤχθετο φοβούμενος, μὴ τὸ φιλότιμον ἐνταῦθα τρέψαντες οἱ νέοι τὴν ἐπὶ τῷ λέγειν δόξαν ἀγαπήσωσι μᾶλλον τῆς ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων καὶ τῶν στρατειῶν, ἐπεὶ δὲ προὔβαινεν ἡ δόξα τῶν φιλοσόφων ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ τοὺς πρώτους λόγους αὐτῶν πρὸς τὴν σύγκλητον ἀνὴρ ἐπιφανὴς σπουδάσας αὐτὸς καὶ δεηθεὶς ἡρμήνευσε, Γάϊος Ἀκίλιος, ἔγνω μετ’ εὐπρεπείας ἀποδιοπομπήσασθαι τοὺς φιλοσόφους ἅπαντας ἐκ τῆς πόλεως.	But Cato, at the very outset, when this zeal for discussion came pouring into the city, was distressed, fearing lest the young men, by giving this direction to their ambition, should come to love a reputation based on mere words more than one achieved by martial deeds. And when the fame of the visiting philosophers rose yet higher in the city, and their first speeches before the Senate were interpreted, at his own instance and request, by so conspicuous a man as Gaius Acilius, Cato determined, on some decent pretext or other, to rid and purge the city of them all.
καὶ παρελθὼν εἰς τὴν σύγκλητον ἐμέμψατο τοῖς ἄρχουσιν, ὅτι πρεσβεία κάθηται πολὺν χρόνον ἄπρακτος ἀνδρῶν, οἳ περὶ παντὸς οὗ βούλοιντο ῥᾳδίως πείθειν δύνανται δεῖν οὖν τὴν ταχίστην γνῶναί τι καὶ ψηφίσασθαι περὶ τῆς πρεσβείας, ὅπως οὗτοι μὲν ἐπὶ τὰς σχολὰς τραπόμενοι διαλέγωνται παισὶν Ἑλλήνων, οἱ δὲ Ῥωμαίων νέοι τῶν νόμων καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων ὡς πρότερον ἀκούωσι.	So he rose in the Senate and censured the magistrates for keeping in such long suspense an embassy composed of men who could easily secure anything they wished, so persuasive were they. We ought, he said, to make up our minds one way or another, and vote on what the embassy proposes, in order that these men may return to their schools and lecture to the sons of Greece, while the youth of Rome give ear to their laws and magistrates, as heretofore.
ταῦτα δ’ οὐχ, ὡς ἔνιοι νομίζουσι, Καρνεάδῃ δυσχεράνας ἔπραξεν, ἀλλ’ ὅλως φιλοσοφίᾳ προσκεκρουκὼς καὶ πᾶσαν Ἑλληνικὴν μοῦσαν καὶ παιδείαν ὑπὸ φιλοτιμίας προπηλακίζων, ὅς γε καὶ Σωκράτη φησὶ λάλον καὶ βίαιον γενόμενον ἐπιχειρεῖν τρόπῳ δυνατὸς ἦν, τυραννεῖν τῆς πατρίδος, καταλύοντα τὰ ἔθη καὶ πρὸς ἐναντίας τοῖς νόμοις δόξας ἕλκοντα καὶ μεθιστάντα τοὺς πολίτας.	This he did, not, as some think, out of personal hostility to Carneades, but because he was wholly averse to philosophy, and made mock of all Greek culture and training, out of patriotic zeal. He says, for instance, that Socrates was a mighty prattler, who attempted, as best he could, to be his country’s tyrant, by abolishing its customs, and by enticing his fellow citizens into opinions contrary to the laws.
τὴν δ’ Ἰσοκράτους διατριβὴν ἐπισκώπτων γηρᾶν φησὶ παρ’ αὑτῷ τοὺς μαθητάς ὡς ἐν Ἅιδου παρὰ Μίνῳ χρησομένους ταῖς τέχναις καὶ δίκας ἐροῦντας.	He made fun of the school of Isocrates, declaring that his pupils kept on studying with him till they were old men, as if they were to practise their arts and plead their cases before Minos in Hades.
τὸν δὲ παῖδα διαβάλλων πρὸς τὰ Ἑλληνικά φωνῇ κέχρηται θρασυτέρᾳ τοῦ γήρως, οἷον ἀποθεσπίζων καὶ προμαντεύων, ὡς ἀπολοῦσι Ῥωμαῖοι τὰ πράγματα γραμμάτων Ἑλληνικῶν ἀναπλησθέντες.	And seeking to prejudice his son against Greek culture, he indulges in an utterance all too rash for his years, declaring, in the tone of a prophet or a seer, that Rome would lose her empire when she had become infected with Greek letters.
ἀλλὰ ταύτην μὲν αὐτοῦ τὴν δυσφημίαν ὁ χρόνος ἀποδείκνυσι κενήν, ἐν ᾧ τοῖς τε πράγμασιν ἡ πόλις ἤρθη μεγίστη καὶ πρὸς Ἑλληνικὰ μαθήματα καὶ παιδείαν ἅπασαν ἔσχεν οἰκείως.	But time has certainly shown the emptiness of this ill-boding speech of his, for while the city was at the zenith of its empire, she made every form of Greek learning and culture her own.
ὁ δ’ οὐ μόνον ἀπηχθάνετο τοῖς φιλοσοφοῦσιν Ἑλλήνων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἰατρεύοντας ἐν Ῥώμῃ δι’ ὑποψίας εἶχε.	It was not only Greek philosophers that he hated, but he was also suspicious of Greeks who practised medicine at Rome.
καὶ τὸν Ἱπποκράτους, ὡς ἔοικεν, ἀκηκοώς λόγον, ὃν εἶπε τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως καλοῦντος αὐτὸν ἐπὶ πολλοῖς τισι ταλάντοις, οὐκ ἄν ποτε βαρβάροις Ἑλλήνων πολεμίοις ἑαυτὸν παρασχεῖν, ἔλεγε κοινὸν ὅρκον εἶναι τοῦτον ἰατρῶν ἁπάντων,	He had heard, it would seem, of Hippocrates’ reply when the Great King of Persia consulted him, with the promise of a fee of many talents, namely, that he would never put his skill at the service of Barbarians who were enemies of Greece.
οἱ γὰρ ἐκ τῆς Αἰγύπτου δανείσαντες τούτοις ἑτερόπλουν τἀργύριον εἰς Ἀθήνας, ὡς ἀφίκοντο εἰς τὴν Ῥόδον καὶ τὴν ναῦν ἐκεῖσε οὗτοι κατεκόμισαν, οὐδὲν οἶμαι διέφερεν αὐτοῖς ἀφεμένοις τῶν τόκων καὶ κομισαμένοις τὸ δάνειον ἐν τῇ Ῥόδῳ πάλιν ἐνεργὸν ποιεῖν εἰς τὴν Αἴγυπτον, ἀλλ’ ἐλυσιτέλει πολλῷ μᾶλλον τοῦτ’ ἢ δεῦρ’ ἐπαναπλεῖν.	For those who lent their money to these men for the outward voyage from Egypt to Athens, when they reached Rhodes and this man put into that port, suffered no loss, I take it, by remitting the interest and receiving the amount of their loan at Rhodes, and then putting the money to work again for a voyage to Egypt. No this was more to their advantage than to continue the voyage to this port.
εὖ γοῦν ὡς γαμεῖν ἔχεις τάλας, καὶ νέον ἐν δωματίῳ πλουσίας πρεσβύτιδος, ὥσπερ οἱ πέρδικες, ἀπὸ συνουσίας παχυνόμενον ἐξανευρὼν μετοικίσει πρὸς παρθένον νύμφην ἀνδρὸς δεομένην.	Indeed, poor wretch, thou art in fine state for marrying! And if he discovers a young man in the house of a rich and elderly woman, waxing fat, like a cockpartridge, in her service, he will remove him and give him to some marriageable maid that wants a husband.
ἔστιν ἄρα τὸ δίκαιον ἀνάλογόν τι.	Justice is therefore a sort of proportion
Κεκλιμένον δὲ χρὴ καταλαμβάνεσθαι τὸν νοσέοντα ὑπὸ τοῦ ἰητροῦ ἐπὶ τὸ πλευρὸν τὸ δεξιὸν, ἢ τὸ ἀριστερὸν, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τὸν τράχηλον καὶ τὰ σκέλεα ὀλίγον ἐπικεκαμμένα ἔχοντα, καὶ τὸ ξύμπαν σῶμα ὑγρὸν κείμενον· οὕτω γὰρ καὶ οἱ πλεῖστοι τῶν ὁγιαινόντων κατακλίνονται· ἄρισται δέ εἰσι τῶν κατακλίσιων αἱ ὅμοιαι τῇσι τῶν ὁγιαινόντων.	It is well when the patient is found by his physician reclining upon either his right or his left side, having his hands, neck, and legs slightly bent, and the whole body lying in a relaxed state, for thus the most of persons in health recline, and these are the best of postures which most resemble those of healthy persons.
τίς ὢν καὶ ἐπὶ τί ἐληλυθώς;	Who are you and for what purpose did you come?
καὶ ἦν ἡγούμενος πάντων τῶν βασιλέων ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἕως γῆς ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἕως ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου.	He was leader of all the kings from the Euphrates River even unto the land of foreigners and unto the borders of Egypt.
λέγεται δὲ καὶ νόμους θεῖναι τοῖς πολίταις, ὥς φησι Σπεύσιππος ἐν τῷ Περὶ φιλοσόφων.	Parmenides is said to have served his native city as a legislator so we learn from Speusippus in his book On Philosophers.
ὥστε δὲ τὴν γυναῖκα ἀπολαβεῖν, ἔφη, πόσα ἄν μοι χρήματα δοίης;	now how much money would you give to get your wife back?
Τὰ δὲ ἀρέσκοντα αὐτῷ ταῦτα ἦν.	The doctrines he approved are these.
ποῦ ᾽ σθ᾽ ἡ Σκύθαινα;	well then where is our scythianess?
ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ σύμμετρον ἤδη τὸ βιβλίον εἴληφε μέγεθος, ἑτέραν ποιησάμενος ἀρχὴν τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν εἰς τὸ προκείμενον πειράσομαι προσαποδοῦναι.	However, since this book is arisen to a competent length, I will make another beginning, and endeavor to add what still remains to perfect my design in the following book.
οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον διωργίσθησαν ὥστ’ οὐδὲ τὸν τυχόντα χρόνον ἀναστροφὴν δόντες ὥρμησαν τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἐπὶ τὸ διαρπάζειν τὰ πρόχειρα τῶν χρημάτων, μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα συλλαμβάνειν τόν τε Γέσκωνα καὶ τοὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ Καρχηδονίους.	This so enraged them, that without a moment's delay they first made a raid upon the money that was kept in readiness, and then arrested Gesco and the Carthaginians with him.
ὁρᾷς ἄρα ὅτι σὺ αὐτὸς ὀνόματα λέγεις, δηλοῖς δὲ οὐδέν;	So you see, you are uttering mere words yourself, and explaining nothing.
εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰωσήφ Τί τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο ἐποιήσατε; οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἰωνισμῷ οἰωνιεῖται ἄνθρωπος οἷος ἐγώ;	Joseph said to them, “What is this thing you have done? Did you not know that a man such as I will divine by omens?”
ἀποθανόντος δ’ αὐτοῦ, λιθίνην εἰκόνα κατασκευάσαντες ἐπορχουμένην ἑαυτῇ βαρβαριστὶ καὶ τοῖς δακτύλοις ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς οἷον ὑποψοφοῦσαν, ἐπέγραψαν, ἔσθιε, πῖνε, ἀφροδισίαζε·	After his decease, they made for him a statue of stone, resembling a woman dancing, who seemed to snap with her fingers as she held them over her head, with this inscription,— Eat, drink, indulge thy lust
ὁρμήσας γοῦν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀλούρου, κατὰ γὰρ ταύτην συνήθροιστο τὴν κώμην τότε τῶν Ἰδουμαίων τὸ στράτευμα, παραγίνεται πρὸς Σίμωνα, καὶ πρώτην αὐτῷ παραδώσειν συντίθεται τὴν αὐτοῦ πατρίδα, λαβὼν ὅρκους ὡς ἀεὶ τίμιος ὢν διατελέσει, συνεργήσειν δὲ ὑπέσχετο καὶ περὶ τῆς ὅλης Ἰδουμαίας.	He went therefore from the village Alurus, wherein the army of the Idumeans were gotten together, and came to Simon, and at the very first he agreed to betray his country to him, and took assurances upon oath from him that he should always have him in esteem, and then promised him that he would assist him in subduing all Idumea under him
Ἀψαλώμου δὲ καὶ Ἀχιτοφέλου τοῦ συμβούλου παραγενομένων εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα σὺν ἅπαντι τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ὁ Δαυίδου φίλος ἧκε πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ προσκυνήσας αὐτὸν συνηύχετο τὴν βασιλείαν εἰς αἰῶνα καὶ τὸν πάντα παραμεῖναι χρόνον.	But when Absalom, and Ahithophel his counselor, were come to Jerusalem, with all the people, David's friend, Hushai, came to them and when he had worshipped Absalom, he withal wished that his kingdom might last a long time, and continue for all ages.
γίνεται γὰρ ἄλφιτα ἐλαίῳ ἐρραμένα.	For it consists of meal steeped in oil
ἀεὶ δὲ μουσοποιὸς ἐς σὲ παρθένων ἔσται μέριμνα, κοὐκ ἀνώνυμος πεσὼν ἔρως ὁ Φαίδρας ἐς σὲ σιγηθήσεται.	Yea, and for ever shall the virgin choir hymn thy sad memory, nor shall Phaedra’s love for thee fall into oblivion and pass away unnoticed.
τὸν οὖν Ἀριστῖνον συμφρονήσαντα παρασχεῖν ἑαυτὸν ὥσπερ ἀρχῆς τικτόμενον ταῖς γυναιξὶν ἀπολοῦσαι καὶ σπαργανῶσαι καὶ θηλὴν ἐπισχεῖν, οὕτω τε δρᾶν καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας, ὑστεροπότμους προσαγορευομένους.	Aristinus, accordingly, chose the part of wisdom and delivered himself like a new-born babe into the hands of women to be washed, and to be wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and to be suckled and all other men in such plight do likewise and they are called Men of Later Fate.
Οὕτως ὅτι χλιαρὸς εἶ, καὶ οὐ ζεστὸς οὔτε ψυχρός, μέλλω σε ἐμέσαι ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου.	"So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἔληξε τῆς θήρας, προσμείξας πρὸς τὰ ὅρια τῶν Ἀρμενίων ἐδειπνοποιήσατο·	And when he stopped hunting, he marched up to the Armenian border and dined
διὸ καὶ νῦν βραχὺ προσαναδραμόντες περὶ τῆς Ἀντιόχου καὶ Πτολεμαίου βασιλείας πειρασόμεθα λαμβάνειν ἀρχὰς ὁμολογουμένας καὶ γνωριζομένας περὶ τῶν λέγεσθαι μελλόντων, ὅπερ ἐστὶ πάντων ἀναγκαιό τατον.	I will accordingly go back a short way in the history of the kingdoms of Antiochus and Ptolemy, and try to fix upon a starting-point for my narrative which shall be accepted and recognised by all for this is a matter of the first importance.
τοῦτό μοι δοκεῖ πρὸς τὴν Ῥωμύλου Ἀρετὴν ἡ Τύχη λέγειν, λαμπρὰ μὲν τὰ σὰ ἔργα καὶ μεγάλα καὶ θεῖον ὡς ἀληθῶς ἐξέφηνας αἷμα καὶ γένος οὖσαν σεαυτήν·	And after this manner Fortune seems to accost the virtue of Romulus it is true indeed, your actions are great and famous, by which you have clearly shown that you are descended of the race of the Gods.
ὕπαρχος ἄλλων δεῦρ’ ἔπλευσας, οὐχ ὅλων στρατηγὸς, ὥςτ’ Αἴαντος ἡγεῖσθαί ποτε.	You sailed here under the command of others, not as a supreme commander who might at any time exercise authority over Ajax.
ὀψὲ δὲ αὐτῷ γεωμετροῦντι λέγει τις, εἶτα νῦν καιρός;	He stadied geometry late, and some one said to him, Is this a proper time?
δοκοῦσι δ’ ἔμοιγε οἱ μὲν παραταττόμενοι ἀπιστοῦσιν ἐοικέναι μὴ χωρὶς γενόμενοι οἱ ἐρώμενοι οὐκ ἀποτελῶσι τὰ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀνδρῶν ἔργα.	My own view is that those who assign these posts in battle suggest thereby that they are suspicious that the objects of their love, if left by themselves, will not perform the duties of brave men.
δοκοῦντες οὖν βελτίονα ὁδὸν δύνασθαι εὑρεῖν, πλανῶνται καὶ ταλαιπωροῦσιν περιπατοῦντες ἐν ταῖς ἀνοδίαις.	They think that it is possible to find a better road, and err and wander miserably in the rough ground.
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐργάζεται, ἔφη, ἄλλο γε ἢ κατὰ σμικρὸν εἰσοικισαμένη ἠρέμα ὑπορρεῖ πρὸς τὰ ἤθη τε καὶ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα· ἐκ δὲ τούτων εἰς τὰ πρὸς ἀλλήλους συμβόλαια μείζων ἐκβαίνει, ἐκ δὲ δὴ τῶν συμβολαίων ἔρχεται ἐπὶ τοὺς νόμους καὶ πολιτείας σὺν πολλῇ, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἀσελγείᾳ, ἕως ἂν τελευτῶσα πάντα ἰδίᾳ καὶ δημοσίᾳ ἀνατρέψῃ.	Nor does it work any, he said, except that by gradual infiltration it softly overflows upon the characters and pursuits of men and from these issues forth grown greater to attack their business dealings, and from these relations it proceeds against the laws and the constitution with wanton licence, Socrates, till finally it overthrows all things public and private.
διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο ἔνια μὲν ἐκ τούτων ὡς ἀρχῶν ἐστὶν εἰς ἃ φθείρονται, ἔνια δὲ οὐκ ἔστιν. ὅσα μὲν οὖν συνειλημμένα τὸ εἶδος καὶ ἡ ὕλη ἐστίν, οἷον τὸ σιμὸν ἢ ὁ χαλκοῦς κύκλος, ταῦτα μὲν φθείρεται εἰς ταῦτα καὶ μέρος αὐτῶν ἡ ὕλη· ὅσα δὲ μὴ συνείληπται τῇ ὕλῃ ἀλλὰ ἄνευ ὕλης, ὧν οἱ λόγοι τοῦ εἴδους μόνον, ταῦτα δ᾽ οὐ φθείρεται, ἢ ὅλως ἢ οὔτοι οὕτω γε· ὥστ᾽ ἐκείνων μὲν ἀρχαὶ καὶ μέρη ταῦτα τοῦ δὲ εἴδους οὔτε μέρη οὔτε ἀρχαί.	and when it is generated it is an individual " of such a kind." the whole individual, callias or socrates, corresponds to " this bronze sphere," but " man " and " animal " correspond to bronze sphere in general. obviously therefore the cause which consists of the forms ( in the sense in which some speak of them, assuming that there are certain entities besides particulars ), in respect at least of generation and destruction, is useless; nor, for this reason at any rate, should they be regarded
καὶ προελθὼν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἑκατὸν σταδίους πρὸς τοῖς εἴκοσιν εἰς τὸ πεδίον ἐν αὐτῷ καταυλίζεται.	So he went away from that city as far as a hundred and twenty furlongs, into a plain, and there pitched his tents.
τὸν δὲ πίνακα ἀνέθηκεν Ἅβρων ὁ παῖς; αὐτοῦ, λαχὼν ἐκ τοῦ γένους τὴν ἱερωσύνην καὶ παραχωρήσας τῷ ἀδελφῷ Λυκόφρονι·	But the tablet was put up by his son Habron, who received the priesthood by inheritance and handed it over to his brother Lycophron
εἰ γοῦν τις δορὰν ἵππων περιθοῖτο θηρεύσει ὅσους ἂν θέλῃ προσίασι γάρ ἐν ἄλλοις δὲ πάλιν φησὶν ὁ Ἀριστοτέλης·	and that if any one puts on a horse's skin he can catch as many as he pleases for they come up to him then of their own accord. And presently, in another passage, Aristotle tells us, The bustard is something like the owl, but it is not a bird which flies by night
Μόσχος δ’ ἐν πρώτῳ Μηχανικῶν Ῥωμαικὸν εἶναι λέγει τὸ μηχάνημα καὶ Ἡρακλείδην τὸν Ταραντῖνον εὑρεῖν αὐτοῦ τὸ εἶδος.	But Moschus, in the first book of his treatise on Mechanics, says that the sambuca is originally a Roman engine, and that Heraclides of Pontus was the original inventor of it.
ὅτι ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐκάλεσα· δότε μεγαλωσύνην τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν.	For the name of the Lord I will proclaim; attribute majesty to our God.
ὦ τλῆμον Ἑλλάς, πένθος οἷον εἰσορῶ ἕξουσαν, ἀνδρὸς τοῦδέ γ’ εἰ σφαλήσεται.	Ah, unhappy Greece, what mourning do I foresee for her, if she is cheated of this man!
ἢν δέ τις ἁλίσκηται, τοῦ λαβόντος εἶναι δοῦλον.	any one who might hereafter be found there was to be the slave of his captor.
σαφέστατα δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐπῆρε τὰ ἐν τῇ Σάμῳ τοῦ Ἀλκιβιάδου ἰσχυρὰ ὄντα καὶ ὅτι αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐδόκει μόνιμον τὸ τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας ἔσεσθαι·	But the great power of Alcibiades at Samos and the opinion they had that the oligarchy was not like to last was it that most evidently encouraged them
σὺ δέ, ἄνθρωπε ἰσόψυχε, ἡγεμών μου καὶ γνωστέ μου·	But it is you, O fellow of equal spirit, leader of me and my friend,
ἃ δὲ ἡγεῖται κακά, οὐδένα οὔτε ἰέναι ἐπὶ ταῦτα οὔτε λαμβάνειν ἑκόντα.	And what is regarded as evil is neither pursued nor accepted willingly, we saw, by anyone.
ἀπὸ γὰρ τούτων τίς τίνος αἴτιός ἐστι γενήσεται φανερόν.	They will show who was responsible for each several proceeding.
ἀλλὰ κόσμει σου τὴν προαίρεσιν, ἔξαιρε τὰ φαῦλα δόγματα.	But rather, Regulate your Will throw away your wrong principles.
δεῖ μὲν δὴ καὶ ταύτῃ ἀκριβῶς τρέφεσθαι ἐκ παίδων διὰ βίου. ἔχει δέ πως, ὡς ἐγᾦμαι, ὧδε·	In this too they must be carefully trained from boyhood through life, and the way of it is this, I believe
καὶ γὰρ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν πεσόντων μαρτυρεῖ καὶ τὰ μνήματα κοινὸν γενέσθαι τὸ κατόρθωμα·	Surely the total number of those who fell, as well as the monuments erected over them, testifies that the success was a common one.
τῆς γὰρ Ἀσίης τὰ πολλὰ βασιλεύεται. ὅκου δὲ μὴ αὐτοὶ ἑωυτῶν εἰσι καρτεροὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι μηδὲ αὐτόνομοι, ἀλλὰ δεσπόζονται, οὐ περὶ τούτου αὐτοῖσιν ὁ λόγος ἐστίν, ὅκως τὰ πολέμια ἀσκήσωσιν, ἀλλ’ ὅκως μὴ δόξωσι μάχιμοι εἶναι. οἱ γὰρ κίνδυνοι οὐχ ὁμοῖοί εἰσι. τοὺς μὲν γὰρ στρατεύεσθαι εἰκὸς καὶ ταλαιπωρεῖν καὶ ἀποθνῄσκειν ἐξ ἀνάγκης ὑπὲρ τῶν δεσποτέων ἀπό τε παιδίων καὶ γυναικὸς ἐόντας καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν φίλων.	for monarchy prevails in the greater part of Asia, and where men are not their own masters nor independent, but are the slaves of others, it is not a matter of consideration with them how they may acquire military discipline, but how they may seem not to be warlike, for the dangers are not equally shared, since they must serve as soldiers, perhaps endure fatigue, and die for their masters, far from their children, their wives, and other friends
μὴ ᾽ λεγχε τὸν πονοῦντ᾽ ἔσω καθημένη.	do not accuse him who suffered while you sat idle at home.
οὐχ οὕτω δ’ ἂν τολμηρὰν ἐποιησάμην τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν, εἰ μὴ καὶ δείξειν ἤμελλον ὑμῖν καὶ ῥᾳδίαν ποιήσειν τὴν διάγνωσιν αὐτῶν.	But I should not have made so bold a proposal, if I were not about to show you what my eloquence is and to make it very easy for you to pass judgement upon it.
καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὃν ἐξελέξασθε, καὶ ἰδοὺ δέδωκεν Κύριος ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς βασιλέα.	But now see the king whom you chose, and see the Lord has placed a king over you.
ἄξιον τοίνυν συλλογίσασθαι καὶ τί ἂν συμβῆναι νομίζομεν μὴ κατὰ τρόπον τούτων ἀγωνισαμένων.	Now we might well reflect what, in our opinion, the outcome would have been, had these men failed to do their duty in the struggle.
ἴθι τὸν αὐτὸν ἔγειρε γόον, ἄναγε πολύδακρυν ἁδονάν.	Come, waken the same lament, take up the enjoyment of long weeping.
καὶ συνῆλθον εἰς ταὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν ἐν Μισηνοῖς ἄκραν καὶ τὸ χῶμα, Πομπηΐῳ μὲν τοῦ στόλου παρορμοῦντος, Ἀντωνίῳ δὲ καὶ Καίσαρι τῶν πεζῶν παρακεκριμένων.	The men met at the promontory and mole of Misenum, near which Pompey’s fleet lay at anchor and the forces of Antony and Caesar were drawn up.
γενομένης δὲ τῆς μετακοσμήσεως καταφανοῦς ὅ τε Παυσανίας ἀποτραπεὶς αὖθις ἐπὶ τοῦ δεξιοῦ κατέστη, καὶ Μαρδόνιος, ὥσπερ εἶχεν ἐξ ἀρχῆς, ἀνέλαβε τὸ εὐώνυμον κατὰ τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους γενόμενος, ἥ τε ἡμέρα διεξῆλθεν ἀργή.	When this change in his enemy’s order of battle was manifest, Pausanias returned and occupied the right wing again, whereupon Mardonius also resumed his own left wing, just as he stood at the beginning, facing the Lacedaemonians. And thus the day came to an end without action.
ὁ δὲ Ἀραβίων ἐν τούτῳ πετροβάταις ἀνδράσιν ἀνέρπουσι διὰ κρημνῶν ἐς τὸ στρατόπεδον τοῦ Κορνιφικίου παρέδυ λαθών.	Meanwhile Arabio, with a band of men accustomed to climbing rocks, scaled a precipice to the camp of Cornificius and stole into it unobserved.
ἀμπτάμενος οὐράνιον ὑψιπετὲς ἐς μέλαθρον, Ὠαρίων ἢ Σείριος ἔνθα πυρὸς φλογέας ἀφίη- σιν ὄσσων αὐγάς, ἢ τὸν ἐς Ἀίδα μελάγχρωτα πορθμὸν ᾄξω τάλας;	Shall I take wings and soar aloft to the mansions of the sky, where Orion and Sirius dart from their eyes a flash as of fire, or shall I, in my misery, plunge to Hades’ murky flood?
οὕτω γένοιτο ἂν ὁ σύμπας στρατὸς διακόσιοι καὶ χίλιοι καὶ μύριοι.	So the whole army would amount to eleven thousand two hundred.
μέχρι μὲν δὴ δεῦρο πρὸς τὴν ἄρκτον ὁ πλοῦς, ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ἐπὶ τὸ πρὸς ἕω μέρος ἐπιστρέφει.	for to this place the direction of the vessel was towards the north, and thence it turns to the east.
καλὸν μὲν οὖν ἐστιν ὃ ἂν δι’ αὑτὸ αἱρετὸν ὂν ἐπαινετὸν ᾖ, ἢ ὃ ἂν ἀγαθὸν ὂν ἡδὺ ᾖ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν·	The noble, then, is that which, being desirable in itself is at the same time worthy of praise, or which, being good, is pleasant because it is good.
καὶ Ἐπίχαρμος ἐν Ἥβας Γάμῳ · λαμβάνοντι γὰρ ὄρτυγας στρουθούς τε κορυδαλλάς τε φιλοκονείμονας τέτραγας σπερματολόγους τε κἀγλαὰς συκαλλίδας.	And Epicharmus, in his Hebe's Wedding, says— For when you've taken quails and sparrows too, And larks who love to robe themselves in dust, And grouse, and rooks, and beauteous fig-peckers.
ἔστω γὰρ δὴ κέρδος τι ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἕτερον κέρδος τι κακόν.	so let us assume that some gain is good, and some other gain evil.
Δαμασίστρατον δὲ ἄνδρα ἐν Πλαταιαῖς βασιλεύοντα ἐπιτυχεῖν τε κειμένοις τοῖς νεκροῖς καὶ θάψαι φασὶν αὐτούς.	According to the story, it was Damasistratus, king of Plataea, who found the bodies lying and buried them.
μέμνησο, τί λέγει ὁ ποιητὴς περὶ τοῦ ξένου·	Remember what the poet says about the stranger
σώζειν δὲ μόνην Ῥαάβην καὶ τὴν γενεὰν αὐτῆς διὰ τοὺς γενομένους πρὸς αὐτὴν τοῖς κατασκόποις ὅρκους.	only that they should save Rahab and her kindred alive, because of the oath which the spies had sworn to her.
τὰ μέντοι τῶν ἰχθύων καὶ τῶν ταρίχων ᾠὰ πάντα δύσπεπτα, δύσφθαρτα, μᾶλλον δὲ τὰ τῶν λιπαρωτέρων καὶ μειζόνων·	Now the roe of every fish, whether fresh or dried and salted, is indigestible and apt to disagree. And the most so of all is the roe of the more oily and larger fish
οὐ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ἐκ μεταβολῆς ἀθανάτοις γενομένοις γεννητοῖς ὁ πάτριος λόγος τὸν θεὸν τοῦτον ἀπολείπει δαίμοσιν, ὥσπερ Ἡρακλέα καὶ Διόνυσον, ἐκ μεταβολῆς ἀρετῇ τὸ θνητὸν καὶ παθητὸν ἀποβαλόντας, ἀλλὰ τῶν ἀϊδίων καὶ ἀγεννήτων εἷς ἐστιν, εἰ δεῖ τοῖς ὑπὸ τῶν φρονιμωτάτων καὶ παλαιοτάτων λεγομένοις τεκμαίρεσθαι περὶ τῶν τηλικούτων.	for my native tradition removes this god from among those deities who were changed from mortals into immortals, like Heracles and Dionysus, whose virtues enabled them to cast off mortality and suffering but he is one of those deities who are unbegotten and eternal, if we may judge by what the most ancient and wisest men have said on such matters.
ὁρίσαντος δὲ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν χρόνον τῶν τε γαμουμένων καὶ τῶν γαμούντων, πρὸς τὸν ζητοῦντα, ἵν’ ἔφη τὰ γεννώμενα ἰσχυρὰ ἐκ τελείων γεννώμενα.	He set limits to the time of marriage for both men and women, and, in answer to the man who inquired about this, he said, So that the offspring may be sturdy by being sprung from mature parents.
εἴθισμαι γὰρ λέγειν πρὸς τοὺς περὶ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν τὴν ἡμετέραν διατρίβοντας ὅτι τοῦτο πρῶτον δεῖ σκέψασθαι, τί τῷ λόγῳ καὶ τοῖς τοῦ λόγου μέρεσι διαπρακτέον ἐστίν·	I am accustomed, that is, to tell the students in my school of rhetoric that the first question to be considered is—what is the object to be accomplished by the discourse as a whole and by its parts?
Ῥωμαῖοι δὲ ὡς ἀντιποιούμενον αὐτὸν τῆς βασιλείας λιθόλευστον ἐποίησαν ὡς Ἀριστείδης ἐν τρίτῳ Ἰταλικῶν.	The citizens interpreted this abatement to an ambitious design he had upon the government, and so stoned him for it.—Aristides, Book Third of his Italian History.
ἐντεῦθεν οὖν τούτῳ τε ἀπηχθόμην καὶ πολλοῖς τῶν παρόντων·	As a result, I became hateful to him and to many of those present
Ἔφθασαν δέ τινες τῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔργοις προτεταγμένων ἁρπάσαντες τὰ ὅπλα πρὸς τὰς πύλας ἐκδραμεῖν.	But without waiting, some of them who were set in charge of the works, grabbed their weapons ran to the gates.
ταύτης τῆς πληγῆς αἴτιον αὐτῷ τὸ τῶν ταξιάρχων ἀπειθὲς κατέστη·	Now the occasion of that blow was this, that the officers would not obey orders
παροξυνθεὶς δ’ ἐπὶ τούτοις ὁ Πάρθος πόλεμον εὐθὺς πρὸς Ἰζάτην κατήγγειλεν.	But the Parthian king was provoked at this his behavior, and denounced war immediately against Izates.
Ἰώαβος δὲ τῇ πολιορκίᾳ τοὺς Ἀμμανίτας ἰσχυρῶς ἐκάκου τῶν τε ὑδάτων αὐτοὺς ἀποτεμνόμενος καὶ τῆς τῶν ἄλλων εὐπορίας, ὡς πάνυ ταλαιπωρεῖν ἐνδείᾳ ποτοῦ καὶ τροφῆς. ἐξ ὀλίγου γὰρ φρέατος ἤρτηντο καὶ ταμείας ὡς μὴ τελέως αὐτοὺς ἐπιλιπεῖν τὴν πηγὴν δαψιλέστερον χρωμένους.	In the siege, Joab hit the Ammanites badly by cutting off their water-supply and other supplies, until they were utterly deprived of food and drink, for they depended on just one small well and this they had to use sparingly in case the spring should fail them entirely.
εἶτα τοῖς ἡγεμονικοῖς παρίστατο δεδοικέναι τὴν ἀναρχίαν ὡς ἀπόστασιν. λέγει δέ τις ἐν αὐτοῖς·	Then their officers began to fear that their lawless spirit might issue in revolt, and one of them made this speech
κεἰ μὲν νοσεῖς τι τῶν ἀπορρήτων κακῶν, γυναῖκες αἵδε συγκαθιστάναι νόσον·	If thou art sick with ills thou canst not name, there be women here to help to set thee right
ὁ δὲ Κρίτων ἔτι πρότερος ἐμοῦ, ἐπειδὴ οὐχ οἷός τ’ ἦν κατέχειν τὰ δάκρυα, ἐξανέστη.	Crito had got up and gone away even before I did, because he could not restrain his tears.
τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἅμα τούτοις ἀλογήματα μακρὸν ἂν εἴη λέγειν πάντα πλὴν τελέως ὀλίγων.	It would be tedious to mention all his other absurdities in connexion with this battle. I must be content with a very few.
ὀρθότατά γε, εἴπερ τῶν γενῶν συγχωρησόμεθα τὰ μὲν ἀλλήλοις ἐθέλειν μείγνυσθαι, τὰ δὲ μή.	It would be perfectly right, if we are to admit that some of the classes will mingle with one another, and others will not.
καὶ τοῖς δύο ἀρχὰς ποιοῦσιν ἄλλην ἀνάγκη ἀρχὴν κυριωτέραν εἶναι, καὶ τοῖς τὰ εἴδη ἔτι ἄλλη ἀρχὴ κυριωτέρα·	Moreover, those who posit two principles must admit another superior principle, and so must the exponents of the Forms
φανταζόμενος δὲ γυναικὶ νεκροῦ τοῦδ’ ὁ παλαιὸς δριμὺς ἀλάστωρ Ἀτρέως χαλεποῦ θοινατῆρος τόνδ’ ἀπέτεισεν, τέλεον νεαροῖς ἐπιθύσας.	A phantom resembling that corpse’s wife, the ancient bitter evil spirit of Atreus, that grim banqueter, has offered him in payment, sacrificing a full-grown victim in vengeance for those slain babes.
καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ σοῦ πρώτης τὸ πρᾶγμα συνέβη· ὡς καὶ πολλὰς καὶ ἄλλας ἠπάτησεν μετὰ σοῦ·	And not with thee first did this matter come about, for many other women also hath he deceived with thee
εἰκὸς δὲ μᾶλλον ἐθέλειν αὐτοὺς συμβουλεύειν τούτοις, οἳ ἂν μὴ μόνον ὅταν δέωνται ἐπερωτῶσι τί χρὴ ποιεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν ταῖς εὐτυχίαις θεραπεύωσιν ὅ τι ἂν δύνωνται τοὺς θεούς.	And we may suppose that they are more ready to counsel those who not only ask what they ought to do in the hour of need, but also serve the gods in the days of their prosperity with all their might.
ὅτι, ἂν τύχῃ βακτηρίαν ἔχων, ἂν μὴ ἐκφύγω φεύγων αὐτόν, εὖ μάλα μου ἐφικέσθαι πειράσεται.	Because, if he happens to have a stick, unless I get away in a hurry, he will try to fetch me a good one.
’ τοιοῦτος ἐγένετο καὶ Αἰθίοψ ὁ Κορίνθιος, ὥς φησι Δημήτριος ὁ Σκήψιος , οὗ μνημονεύει Ἀρχίλοχος .	Such also was Aethiops the Corinthian, as Demetrius the Scepsian relates, of whom mention is made by Archilochus
καὶ παρὰ μὲν ταύτης ἐπέσταλτο βασιλεῖ τὰς παρὰ Σαλώμης ἐπιστολὰς ἐν τοῖς Λιουίας εὑρηκέναι γράμμασιν, πεπομφέναι δὲ αὐτῷ λάθρα δι’ εὔνοιαν.	By her a message was sent to the king, that she had found a letter written by Salome, among Julia's papers, and had sent it to him privately, out of her good-will to him.
ἀναβαίνει οὖν ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς φίλον, καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχων ὁπλίτας ἀνέβη τριακοσίους, ἄρχοντα δὲ αὐτῶν Ξενίαν Παρράσιον.	Cyrus accordingly went up to his father, taking with him Tissaphernes as a friend and accompanied by three hundred Greek hoplites, under the command of Xenias of Parrhasia.
ἕτερον δὲ λέγεις τοιοῦτον ἀληθινόν, ἢ ἐπὶ τίνι τὸ τοιοῦτον εἶπες;	Do you mean another such true one, or in what sense did you say such?
ἢν δέ τι ἄρα προσδέωμαι, ὁ πάππος με, ἔφη, οὗτος ἐπιδιδάξει.	and, he added, if I do require anything more, my grandfather here will teach me that.
μετ᾽ αὐτὸν Σαδδοὺκ υἱὸς Ἐμμὴρ ἐξ ἐναντίας οἴκου αὐτοῦ. καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐκράτησεν Σαμαιὰ υἱὸς Ἐχενιά, ὁ φύλαξ οἴκου τῆς ἀνατολῆς.	After him Zadok, son of Immer, opposite his house. And after him Shemaiah, son of Echenia, keeper of the east side of the house, took possession.
ἅμα δὲ τοῖς μὲν Ῥωμαίοις ἑπομένων καὶ παρακαλούντων τῶν κατόπιν, τοῖς δὲ μισθοφόροις τῶν Καρχηδονίων οὐ συνεγγιζόντων οὐδὲ παραβοηθούντων, ἀλλ’ ἀποδειλιώντων ταῖς ψυχαῖς, πέρας ἐνέκλιναν οἱ βάρβαροι, καὶ δόξαντες ἐγκαταλείπεσθαι προφανῶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων, ἐπιπεσόντες κατὰ τὴν ἀποχώρησιν εἰς τοὺς ἐφεστῶτας ἔκτεινον τούτους.	while the Carthaginians did not keep up with their mercenaries nor support them, but showed a thoroughly cowardly spirit. The result was that the foreign soldiers gave way and, believing that they had been shamelessly abandoned by their own side, fell upon the men on their rear as they were retreating, and began killing them
καὶ οὕτως ἐφ’ ἑκάστης ὕλης τὸν ἔμπειρον τοῦ ἀπείρου κρατεῖν πᾶσα ἀνάγκη.	In every department the skilful must necessarily be superior to the unskilful.
ἁλίσκεται δὲ καὶ ὅταν ᾖ πνίγη, διωκόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν κυνῶν·	The boar is also captured, in hot weather, when pursued by the hounds
θέλοντες εἶναι νομοδιδάσκαλοι, μὴ νοοῦντες μήτε ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται.	desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm.
ἀναγκαῖον τοίνυν ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων τὰ μὲν ὑπάρχειν, τὰ δὲ παρασκευάσαι τὸν νομοθέτην.	It follows therefore from what has been said that some goods must be forthcoming to start with and others must be provided by the legislator.
ἐπιλαβόμενος γὰρ στασιαζόντων ὁ δῆμος, καὶ λαβὼν προστάτην ἐκ τῶν γνωρίμων, ἐπιθέμενος ἐκράτησεν, ἀσθενὲς γὰρ τὸ στασιάζον·	for the common people seized the opportunity of their quarrel and, taking a champion from among the notables, fell upon them and conquered them, for a party divided against itself is weak.
πρῶτον μὲν τοίνυν οἱ ἔφοροι προκηρύττουσι τὰ ἔτη εἰς ἃ δεῖ στρατεύεσθαι καὶ ἱππεῦσι καὶ ὁπλίταις, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τοῖς χειροτέχναις·	The Ephors issue a proclamation stating the age-limit fixed for the levy, first for the cavalry and infantry, and then for the handicraftsmen.
Οὐ γὰρ γίγνονται ἐκπλήξιες τῆς γνώμης, οὔτε μετάστασις ἰσχυρὴ τοῦ σώματος, ἀφ’ ὕτων εἰκὸς τὴν ὀργὴν ἀγριοῦσθαί τε, καὶ τοῦ ἀγνώμονος καὶ θυμοειδέος μετέχειν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν τῷ αὐτέῳ αἰεὶ ἐόντα.	for there is neither excitement of the understanding nor any strong change of the body whereby the temper might be ruffled and they be roused to inconsiderate emotion and passion, rather than living as they do always in the state.
Ἀρχέστρατος δέ φησιν · σάλπην δὲ κακὸν μὲν ἔγωγε ἰχθὺν εἰς ἀεὶ κρίνω·	And Archestratus says— I always do account the fish call'd salpe A worthless fish.
καὶ ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος διὰ τοῦτο ἐξεῖλεν αὐτὴν ἀνοῖξαι βουλόμενος τὰ στενά.	Alexander demolished it, with the intention of opening the defiles.
ἀποκριναμένου δὲ τοῦ Σόλωνος ὡς οἴκοι βέλτιόν ἐστι ποιεῖσθαι φιλίας, οὐκοῦν, φάναι τὸν Ἀνάχαρσιν, αὐτὸς ὢν οἴκοι σὺ ποίησαι φιλίαν καὶ ξενίαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς.	On Solon’s replying that it was better to make one’s friendships at home, Well then, said Anacharsis, do thou, who art at home, make me thy friend and guest.
ἔδοξε δὲ καὶ τοῖς περὶ Ἡρώδην μὴ ἀπελέγχειν αὐτοῦ τὴν προσποίησιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ἀνύποπτον ἀντιφιλοφρονεῖσθαι τὸν Μάλιχον.	but Herod and his friends though, it proper not openly to contradict Malichus's hypocrisy, but to give him tokens of mutual friendship, in order to prevent his suspicion of them.
ἅμα δὲ περὶ πάντων εἰπεῖν ἀδύνατον.	yet to answer them all simultaneously is impossible.
καὶ μὴν περὶ τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον ἐπιτηδευμάτων, ὅτι δεῖ πάντα τἆλλα τέλος ἔχειν τὴν εὐσέβειαν, καὶ γυναικῶν ἀκούσειεν ἄν τις καὶ τῶν οἰκετῶν.	as also we have but one way of speaking concerning the conduct of our lives, that all other things ought to have piety for their end and this any body may hear from our women, and servants themselves.
μάλιστα γάρ ἂν οὕτως ἔν τε τῷ παρόντι παύσασθαι τὴν φιλονεικίαν, καὶ τὸν ἀποδειχθέντα πρὸς ἀμφοτέρους ἴσον γενέσθαι, τοὺς μὲν ὡς ἑλομένους ἀγαπῶντα, τοῖς δὲ εὔνουν ὄντα διὰ συγγένειαν, ἐπιτρεψάντων δὲ προτέροις τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις τῶν Σαβίνων τὴν αἵρεσιν, ἔδοξε μᾶλλον ἑλέσθαι Σαβῖνον αὐτοὺς ἀποδείξαντας ἢ παρασχεῖν Ῥωμαῖον ἐκείνων ἑλομένων.	This was thought the best way to end their prevailing partisanship, and the king thus appointed would be equally well-disposed to both parties, being gracious to the one as his electors, and friendly to the other because of his kinship with them. Then, as the Sabines gave the Romans their option in the matter, it seemed to them better to have a Sabine king of their own nomination, than to have a Roman made king by the Sabines.
ὅθεν Φιλίππου τὴν ἀρχὴν παραλαβόντος Παρμενίων αὐτὸν ἐν Ὠρεῷ λαβὼν ἀπέκτεινεν, ὥς φησι Καρύστιος ἐν Ἱστορικοῖς Ὑπομνήμασι .	on which account, after Philip obtained the government, Parmenio, having caught him in Oreum, put him to death as Carystius relates in his Historical Com- mentaries.
ἐρώτα οὖν πάλιν ἐξ ἀρχῆς.	Begin your questions, then, over again.
Ἀφ' ὑμῶν γὰρ ἐξήχηται ὁ λόγος τοῦ κυρίου οὐ μόνον ἐν τῇ Μακεδονίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἀχαΐᾳ, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν ἡ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἐξελήλυθεν, ὥστε μὴ χρείαν ἡμᾶς ἔχειν λαλεῖν τι.	For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.
Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπατήσῃ τις παρθένον ἀμνήστευτον καὶ κοιμηθῇ μετ᾽ αὐτῆς, φερνῇ φερνιεῖ αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα.	“ ‘And if a certain man seduces a virgin not yet betrothed and lies with her, he will surely pay a bridal price for her as his wife.
ἀλλὰ μὴν ὅ γ’ ἑταῖρος ἡμῶν, ἔφη, οὐθὲν τοιοῦτον, λέγων τὸν Σωκράτη, καὶ Ἡγησίπολις ἐν Δελφοῖς ἠρώτα τὸν θεόν, πρότερον κεχρημένος Ὀλυμπίασιν, εἰ αὐτῷ τὰ αὐτὰ δοκεῖ ἅπερ τῷ πατρί, ὡς αἰσχρὸν ὂν τἀναντία εἰπεῖν, καὶ περὶ τῆς Ἑλένης ὡς Ἰσοκράτης ἔγραψεν ὅτι σπουδαία, εἴπερ Θησεὺς ἔκρινεν, καὶ περὶ Ἀλεξάνδρου, ὅτι αἱ θεαὶ προέκριναν, καὶ περὶ Εὐαγόρου, ὅτι σπουδαῖος, ὥσπερ Ἰσοκράτης φησίν·	Hegesippus, after having first consulted the oracle at Olympia, asked the god at Delphi whether his opinion was the same as his father's, meaning that it would be disgraceful to contradict him. Helen was a virtuous woman, wrote Isocrates, because Theseus so judged the same applies to Alexander Paris, whom the goddesses chose before others. Evagoras was virtuous, as Isocrates says, for at any rate Conon.
Τῶν δὲ ταγμάτων εἰσθεόντων οὔτε παραίνεσις οὔτ' ἀπειλὴ κατεῖχεν τὰς ὁρμάς, ἀλλ' ὁ θυμὸς ἁπάντων ἐστρατήγει:	Neither pleas nor threats could restrain the violence of the unrushing legions but all were governed by rage.
ὁ δὲ ἐν αἰφνιδίῳ κακῷ καὶ ἀδοκήτῳ τοὺς στρατιώτας ἐκέλευε, τὰς ναῦς ἐκλιπόντας, ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἀμύνεσθαι τοὺς πολεμίους.	Pausimachus, in this sudden and unexpected catastrophe, ordered his men to abandon their ships and defend themselves on land.
τούτοις δὲ προάγωσι χρησόμεθα πραγμάτων μεγάλων.	and we will make these contests but the preliminaries of great enterprises.
αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ τῶν σωματικῶν ἡδονῶν ἀπόλαυσις.	And the Persians overthrew the Medes for the same reason, namely, in order to have an unrestrained enjoyment of sensual pleasures.
ἔπεστι δὲ καὶ ἐλεγεῖον ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, Δέξο ἄναξ Κρονίδα Ζεῦ Ὀλύμπιε καλὸν ἄγαλμα ἱλάῳ θυμῷ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις.	On it is an elegiac couplet Accept, king, son of Cronus, Olympian Zeus, a lovely image,And have a heart propitious to the Lacedaemonians.
μικρὸν γὰρ οὐδὲν οὐδ’ ἥσυχον οὐδ’ ὁμολογούμενον ἔργον ἐστίν, ὅταν ἄνευ νοῦ τῷ παθητικῷ σώματος ἐπιλάβωνται.	For there is nothing small, staid, constant, and accordant, after that being forsaken by the understanding, they come to be seized by corporeal passions.
δοκεῖ δέ τισι καὶ Λακεδαίμονα καὶ Θεσσαλονίκην ἐς διαρπαγὴν αὐτοῖς δώσειν ὑποσχέσθαι.	Some writers say that he promised to give them also the cities of Lacedæmon and Thessalonica to plunder.
ἔσται δὲ Βάκτρα καὶ τοῦ στόματος τῆς Κασπίας θαλάττης εἴτε Ὑρκανίας πάμπολύ τι ἀρκτικώτερα, ὅπερ τοῦ μυχοῦ τῆς Κασπίας καὶ τῶν Ἀρμενιακῶν καὶ Μηδικῶν ὀρῶν διέχει περὶ ἑξακισχιλίους σταδίους, καὶ δοκεῖ αὐτῆς τῆς παραλίας μέχρι τῆς Ἰνδικῆς ἀρκτικώτερον εἶναι σημεῖον καὶ περίπλουν ἔχειν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς δυνατόν, ὥς φησιν ὁ τῶν τόπων ἡγησάμενος τούτων Πατροκλῆς.	And that Bactra is still farther north than the mouth of the Caspian or Hyrcanian Sea, which is distant about 6000 stadia from the recess of the Caspian and the mountains of Armenia and Media, and which appears to be the most northerly point of the whole coast as far as India, with a sea navigable to India all the way, as Patrocles, who had the government of these regions, affirms.
εἰ τὸν ἀπαθῆ τηρεῖς, εἰ τὸν ἀκατάπληκτον, εἰ τὸν κατεσταλμένον, εἰ βλέπεις μᾶλλον τὰ γινόμενα ἢ βλέπῃ, εἰ μὴ φθονεῖς τοῖς προτιμωμένοις, εἰ μὴ ἐκπλήσσουσίν σε αἱ ὗλαι, τί σοι λείπει;	if you are rather an observer of what is done than the subject of observation if you do not envy those who are preferred to you if you are not overcome by the occasion, what need you more?
μάλιστα δὲ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ κακὸν σημαίνει τὸ ποιὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ἐμψύχων, καὶ τούτων μάλιστα ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔχουσι προαίρεσιν.	Quality refers especially to "good" and "bad" in the case of living things, and of these especially in the case of such as possess choice.
κἀκεῖθεν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἀκούσαντες τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν ἦλθαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν ἡμῖν ἄχρι Ἀππίου φόρου καὶ Τριῶν ταβερνῶν, οὓς ἰδὼν ὁ Παῦλος εὐχαριστήσας τῷ θεῷ ἔλαβεν θάρσος.¶	The brothers from there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When he saw them, Paul thanked God and took courage.
ἦν δέ τις φησὶν ἐν τῷ στρατεύματι Ξενοφῶν, οὔτε στρατηγὸς οὔτε λοχαγός ἀλλὰ τῷ φρονεῖν τὰ δέοντα καὶ τολμᾶν αὑτὸν εἰς τὸ ἄρχειν καταστήσας διέσῳσε τοὺς Ἕλληνας.	There was, says Xenophon, one in the army named Xenophon, who was neither general nor inferior commander but yet this man, by his skill in what was fit and boldness in attempting, raising himself to command, preserved the Grecians.
τίς δ᾽ ὦ μέλ᾽ ἡμῶν οὐ λαλεῖν ἐπίσταται;	is there ever a one among us cannot use her tongue?
μαρτυρεῖ δέ μοι κάσις πηλοῦ ξύνουρος διψία κόνις τάδε, ὡς οὔτ’ ἄναυδος οὔτε σοι δαίων φλόγα ὕλης ὀρείας σημανεῖ καπνῷ πυρός, ἀλλ’ ἢ τὸ χαίρειν μᾶλλον ἐκβάξει λέγων τὸν ἀντίον δὲ τοῖσδ’ ἀποστέργω λόγον·	The thirsty dust, consorting sister of the mud, assures me that neither by pantomime nor by kindling a flame of mountain wood will he signal with smoke of fire. Either in plain words he will bid us to rejoice the more, or—but I have little love for the report opposite to this!
ὁ δὲ Σκιπίων χρημάτων μὲν οὐκ ἔφη δεῖσθαι, τὰ γὰρ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τῶν φίλων ἐξαρκέσειν·	Scipio said that he did not need monev, for his own and that of his friends would be sufficient
μηδενὸς δὲ τῷ κλιθέντι μέρει τῶν Ἰουδαίων προσβοηθοῦντος τούτους μὲν συνέβαινε φεύγειν μὴ βοηθούντων τῶν πλησίον ἀλλὰ κοινωνούντων τῆς φυγῆς, οἱ δὲ τοῦ Πτολεμαίου τὰ ἐναντία τούτων ἔπραττον·	but as there were no auxiliaries to afford help to that part of the Jews that gave way, it fell out that they fled, and those near them did no assist them, but fled along with them. However, Ptolemy's soldiers acted quite otherwise
τρία γάρ ἐστι τὰ μέγιστα ἃ διαφυλάττει καὶ διασῴζει τὴν δημοκρατίαν καὶ τὴν τῆς πόλεως εὐδαιμονίαν, πρῶτον μὲν ἡ τῶν νόμων τάξις, δεύτερον δ’ ἡ τῶν δικαστῶν ψῆφος, τρίτον δ’ ἡ τούτοις τἀδικήματα παραδιδοῦσα κρίσις.	For the things which in the main uphold our democracy and preserve the city's prosperity are three in number first the system of law, second the vote of the jury, and third the method of prosecution by which the crimes are handed over to them.
καὶ γὰρ τὸν Εὐριπίδου Ἀλκμαίωνα γελοῖα φαίνεται τὰ ἀναγκάσαντα μητροκτονῆσαι.	for instance, we think it ridiculous that Alcmaeon in Euripides' play is compelled by certain threats to murder his mother!
πυθομένῳ δὲ Ἁβράμῳ καὶ περὶ τοῦ Ἰσμαήλου, εἰ ζήσεται, πολυχρόνιόν τε ἀπεσήμαινεν ὁ θεὸς καὶ μεγάλων ἐθνῶν πατέρα.	When Abram also asked about the life of Ismael, God revealed that he would live a long time and become the father of great nations.
τότε μὲν οὖν ἠγάπησαν οἱ πατρίκιοι τήν διάλυσιν, καὶ τόν Μάρκιον ἀσμένως ἔχοντες ἀπῆλθον.	For the time being, then, the patricians were satisfied with this truce, and went away in glad possession of Marcius.
οὕτω μὲν δὴ διακείμενοι πάντες ἀνεπαύοντο.	Such was the state of mind in which they all lay down to rest.
Τοῦτον οὖν τὸν τίτλον πολλοὶ ἀνέγνωσαν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἦν ὁ τόπος τῆς πόλεως ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη ὁ Ἰησοῦς· καὶ ἦν γεγραμμένον Ἑβραϊστί, Ἑλληνιστί, Ῥωμαϊστί.	Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
βεβήλοισι δὲ, οὐ θέμις, πρὶν ἢ τελεσθῶσιν ὀργίοισιν ἐπιστήμης.	and it is not lawful to import them to the profane until they have been initiated in the mysteries of the science.
ἐν δὲ τῷ τούτους ἐγκλίναντας φεύγειν οἱ προσβοηθοῦντες θωρακῖται κατὰ πορείαν ἀτάκτως ἐπιπαραγενόμενοι καὶ σποράδην, οἱ μὲν ἀποροῦντες ἐπὶ τοῖς γινομένοις, οἱ δὲ συμπίπτοντες ἀντίοις τοῖς φεύγουσι κατὰ τὴν ἀποχώρησιν, ἀναστρέφειν ἠναγκάζοντο καὶ τὸ παραπλήσιον ποιεῖν.	whose flight involved that of the heavy-armed troops also which were coming to their relief. For the latter were advancing in separate detachments in loose order, and, either in dismay at what was happening, or upon meeting their flying comrades on their retreat, were compelled to follow their example
καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἠσαίας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ σκιὰ ἐν τοῖς ἀναβαθμοῖς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω δέκα βαθμούς.	Isaiah the prophet cried to the Lord, and the shadow returned on the steps to what was behind ten degrees.
πειρῶντι δὲ καὶ χρυσὸς ἐν βασάνῳ πρέπει καὶ νόος ὀρθός.	Gold shows its nature when it is tried by the touchstone, and so does a right-thinking mind.
Καὶ καθὼς ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Νῶε, οὕτως ἔσται καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου.	"And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:
διόπερ ἠξίου πάντας μὲν φυλάξασθαι τὸν καιρόν, μάλιστα δὲ Φίλιππον.	Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King.
ταῦτα σχεδόν, ὦ Σόσσιε Σενεκίων, τελευταῖα τῶν ἐν τοῖς Μουσείοις τότε παρ’ Ἀμμωνίῳ τῷ ἀγαθῷ φιλολογηθέντων.	These, my Sossius Senecio, were almost the last discourses which we had at Ammonius’s house during the festival of the Muses.
ἀντιπρεσβευσαμένων δὲ καὶ Ἀχαιῶν Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ λόγων ῥηθέντων ὑπὸ ἀμφοτέρων ἐπὶ τῆς βουλῆς, τοὺς αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλουσιν αὖθις οἱ Ῥωμαῖοι Λακεδαιμονίοις γενέσθαι καὶ Ἀχαιοῖς δικαστάς, Ἄππιον καὶ ὅσοι σὺν ἐκείνῳ πρότερον ἐς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἀφίκοντο.	A deputation of the Achaeans was sent to oppose the Lacedaemonians, and after speeches had been delivered by both sides before the senate, the Romans again despatched the same commissioners, Appius and his former colleagues in Greece, to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans.
τοὺς δὲ Περσέως υἱὸν ἀποφαίνεσθαι τὸν Ἐρύθραν, ἡγήσασθαί τε τῶν τόπων.	But according to others, it was Erythras the son of Perseus who was the king of this country.
καὶ εἰ τὸ γένος ὅλον τῶν δυνατῶν γενέσθαι, καὶ τὸ εἶδος, καὶ εἰ τὸ εἶδος, καὶ τὸ γένος, οἷον εἰ πλοῖον γενέσθαι δυνατόν, καὶ τριήρη, καὶ εἰ τριήρη, καὶ πλοῖον.	And if the whole genus is among things possible to be made, so is the species, and if the species, so the genus for example, if a vessel can be built, so can a trireme, if a trireme can, so can a vessel.
πολλὸς δ’ ἱμερόεντα χορὸν περιίσταθ’ ὅμιλος τερπόμενος· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντες ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους.	now shape in oblique ways Confus'dly regular the moving maze. Now forth at once too swift for sight they spring, And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring.
ἐπέπρακτο δ’ ἄν τι μεῖζον ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ μὴ ταχείας ἐπιστροφῆς γενομένης·	and he would have done greater things, unless care had been taken to repress him immediately
ὕστερον δὲ τῷ Τημένῳ γενόμενος δι’ ὀργῆς ὁ Λέαγρος εἰς Λακεδαίμονα μετέστη τὸ παλλάδιον κομίζων.	Afterward Leager, by reason of a feud betwixt him and Temenus, went over into Lacedaemon and transported the Palladium thither.
Δανίηλος τοίνυν ὢν ἐν τοιαύτῃ τιμῇ καὶ λαμπρᾷ σπουδῇ παρὰ τῷ Δαρείῳ καὶ πρὸς ἅπαντα ὑπ' αὐτοῦ μόνος, ὡς ἂν ἔχων τὸ θεῖον πεπιστευμένος ἐν αὑτῷ, παραλαμβανόμενος ἐφθονήθη: βασκαίνουσι γὰρ οἱ μᾶλλον αὐτῶν ἑτέρους ἐν πλείονι τιμῇ παρὰ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι βλέποντες.	As Daniel was held in such dignity and favour by Darius and had everything entrusted to him alone, for the divine element within him, he was envied by the rest, for those who see others more honoured by kings than themselves envy them.
ἀλλ’ ᾗ μὲν ἄριστον ἦν, οὐκ ἐπήγαγεν ἰατρείαν οὐδὲ καινοτομίαν, φοβηθεὶς μὴ συγχέας παντάπασι καὶ ταράξας τὴν πόλιν ἀσθενέστερος γένηται τοῦ καταστῆσαι πάλιν καὶ συναρμόσασθαι πρὸς τὸ ἄριστον·	Nay, where a condition was as good as it could well be, he applied no remedy, and introduced no innovation, fearing lest, after utterly confusing and confounding the city, he should be too weak to establish it again and recompose it for the best.
ἔκλαυσαν δὲ ταῦτα παθόντας αὐτοὺς οἱ κωμῆται, καὶ πένθος ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς ἤγειραν οἷον εἰκὸς ἐπὶ θεοπέμπτῳ κακῷ καὶ τὸν ἴδιον ἕκαστος ἀπεθρήνει·	Those of that village wept for these that had thus suffered, and made such a lamentation as was naturally to be expected on so great a misfortune that was sent from God and every one mourned for his own relation.
ἔστι δὲ καὶ τοῦ Κυρηναίου Κρατισθένους χαλκοῦν ἅρμα, καὶ Νίκη τε ἐπιβέβηκε τοῦ ἅρματος καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ Κρατισθένης.	There is also a bronze statue of Cratisthenes of Cyrene, and on the chariot stand Victory and Cratisthenes himself.
μόνος γὰρ ὁ θεὸς οὗτος οἶδ᾽ ὅτι τροπαῖον ἂν στήσαιτο τῶν ταύτης τρόπων.	plutus will readily triumph over her threats unaided.

κρεῖττόν ἐστι μετ’ ὀλίγων ἀγαθῶν πρὸς ἅπαντας τοὺς κακοὺς ἢ μετὰ πολλῶν κακῶν πρὸς ὀλίγους ἀγαθοὺς μάχεσθαι.	It is better to be with a handful of good men fighting against all the bad, than with hosts of bad men against a handful of good men.
καὶ διεξώδευσε καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν οὓς εὗρεν περὶ τὴν κάμινον τῶν Χαλδαίων.	And so it broke out of control and burned those it reached from around the furnace from the Chaldeans.
ὅτι δ’ οἶδεν αὐτούς, οἱ χρονογράφοι δηλοῦσιν ἢ μικρὸν πρὸ αὐτοῦ τὴν τῶν Κιμμερίων ἔφοδον ἢ κατ’ αὐτὸν ἀναγράφοντες.	That he was acquainted with these people we may satisfy ourselves from the chroniclers, who report an incursion made by the Cimmerians either during his life-time or just before.
Βλέπετε, ἀδελφοί, μήποτε ἔσται ἔν τινι ὑμῶν καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ζῶντος·	Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;
ταῦτ’ ἐστὶ τἀληθῆ, μετὰ πάσης παρρησίας, ἁπλῶς εὐνοίᾳ τὰ βέλτιστ’ εἰρημένα, οὐ κολακείᾳ βλάβης καὶ ἀπάτης λόγος μεστός, ἀργύριον τῷ λέγοντι ποιήσων, τὰ δὲ πράγματα τῆς πόλεως τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἐγχειριῶν.	There you have the truth spoken with all freedom, simply in goodwill and for the best—no speech packed by flattery with mischief and deceit, and intended to put money into the speaker’s pocket and the control of the State into our enemies’ hands.
Οὕτως λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων Ἐπὶ τί ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε; καθήσεσθε ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ;	“Thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Upon what have you trusted that you shall stay in the enclosure in Jerusalem?
Τῶν οὖν κατὰ Νικάνορα χωρησάντων οὕτως, καὶ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνων τῶν καιρῶν κρατηθείσης τῆς πόλεως ὑπὸ τῶν Ἐβραίων, καὶ αὐτὸς αὐτόθι τὸν λόγον καταπαύσω.	So the things concerning Nicanor turned out in this manner. And from those times, the city was ruled over by the Hebrews. And I will bring to a close myself this account at this point.
τοῦτό ἐστιν ἀρχαιότατον ἐν τῷ ναῷ·	This is the oldest object in the temple.
ἀγωνιῶ δὲ καὶ δέδοικα παντελῶς, μὴ ποτ’ ἐπιβὰς κήρυκι τὸν πόδ’ ἀναπαρῶ αὐλεῖν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἱεροῖσιν αὐλητοῦ κακοῦ μέλλοντος ὁ Στρατόνικος ’ εὐφήμει, μέχρι σπείσαντες εὐξώμεσθα φησί, ’ τοῖς θεοῖς.	but I'm in fear Lest I should tread by hazard on some κῆρυξ, And pierce my foot with its spikes and lame myself." Once, when a wretched flute-player was preparing To play the flute at a sacred festival, Let us have only sounds of omen good, Said Stratonicus "let us pour libations And pray devoutly to the mighty gods."
καί με τούτων ἐναντίον διηρώτησας εἰ μνημονεύω, κατ’ ἀρχὰς ὅτ’ ἦλθον, κελεύων σε τὰς πόλεις τὰς Ἑλληνίδας κατοικίζειν·	And in the presence of those men you asked me whether I remembered bidding you, when I first arrived, to plant settlers in the Greek cities.
οἱ δὲ Θηβαῖοι αἰσθόμενοι ἐβοήθουν, καὶ καταλαβόντες προκεχωρηκότας ἤδη τοὺς Θρᾷκας οὐ πολὺ τήν τε λείαν ἀφείλοντο καὶ αὐτοὺς φοβήσαντες καταδιώκουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Εὔριπον καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, οὗ αὐτοῖς τὰ πλοῖα ἃ ἤγαγεν ὥρμει.	The Thebans, hearing of it, came out to help them, and overtaking the Thracians before they had gone far, both recovered the booty and chased them to the Euripus and to the sea, where the galleys lay that brought them. Some of them they killed
παντὸς γοῦν τοῦ Ἰουδαϊκοῦ βεβαιώσαντος δι’ ὅρκων ἦ μὴν εὐνοήσειν Καίσαρι καὶ τοῖς βασιλέως πράγμασιν, οἵδε οἱ ἄνδρες οὐκ ὤμοσαν ὄντες ὑπὲρ ἑξακισχίλιοι, καὶ αὐτοὺς βασιλέως ζημιώσαντος χρήμασιν ἡ Φερώρου γυνὴ τὴν ζημίαν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν εἰσφέρει.	Accordingly, when all the people of the Jews gave assurance of their good-will to Caesar, and to the king's government, these very men did not swear, being above six thousand and when the king imposed a fine upon them, Pheroras's wife paid their fine for them.
ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἐμφερέστατος Κράσσῳ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων Γάιος Πακκιανός, ἐσθῆτα βασιλικὴν γυναικὸς ἐνδὺς καὶ διδαχθεὶς Κράσσος ὑπακούειν καὶ αὐτοκράτωρ τοῖς καλοῦσιν, ἐφ’ ἵππου καθήμενος ἤγετο·	That one of his captives who bore the greatest likeness to Crassus, Caius Paccianus, put on a woman’s royal robe, and under instructions to answer to the name of Crassus and the title of Imperator when so addressed, was conducted along on horseback.
διὰ τί Ταναγραίοις πρὸ τῆς πόλεως ἔστιν Ἀχίλλειον, τόπος οὕτω προσαγορευόμενος;	Why do the people of Tanagra have before their city an Achilleum, that is, a place bearing this name?
διὸ καὶ κατὰ γένη ποιοῦνται καὶ καθ’ ἡλικίαν τὰς ἐκ τῶν νυκτερευμάτων ἐξαγωγάς.	They therefore drive them out from their night styes to feed, according to their litters and ages.

Πετρώνιός τε ὕστερον τοῦ Ἀλεξανδρέων πλήθους τοσούτων μυριάδων ὁρμήσαντος ἐπ’ αὐτὸν μετὰ λίθων βολῆς, αὐτοῖς τοῖς περὶ ἑαυτὸν στρατιώταις ἀντέσχε, καὶ διαφθείρας τινὰς αὐτῶν τοὺς λοιποὺς ἔπαυσε.	At a later period Petronius resisted, with the soldiers about his person, a mob of myriads of Alexandrines, who attacked him by throwing stones. He killed some, and compelled the rest to desist.
μὴ θαυμάζετ’ εἰ τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ζῴοις τὰ πρὸς τὸ σῶμα ἕτοιμα γέγονεν, οὐ μόνον τροφαὶ καὶ πόμα, ἀλλὰ καὶ κοίτη καὶ τὸ μὴ δεῖσθαι ὑποδημάτων, μὴ ὑποστρωμάτων, μὴ ἐσθῆτος, ἡμεῖς δὲ πάντων τούτων προσδεόμεθα.	Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are provided for the body, not only food and drink, but beds also, and they have no need of shoes nor bed materials, nor clothing but we require all these additional things.
ὕδατι γένεσις, ἀλλ’ ἔτι σαφέστερον ἐπ’ αὐτῶν ἡμῶν·	but you may see this more plainly in men themselves
καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἐρύθειαν ἐν ὄρει Ἄβαντι αὐλίζεται.	And having reached Erythia he lodged on Mount Abas.
τούτου γὰρ μεμνῆσθαι καὶ κρατεῖν, ὅτι ἡ θύρα ἤνοικται.	For you must always remember, and hold to this, that the door is open.
ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ ἐξέλιπον οὐδ’ ἂν ἐκλίποιμι τὸν μεθ’ ὑμῶν καὶ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἀγῶνα, ἀλλὰ καὶ στρατιώτην ἐμαυτὸν ὑμῖν καὶ στρατηγὸν ἐπιδίδωμι καί, εἴ τις ἔστι μοι πολέμων ἐμπειρία καὶ τύχη ἀηττήτῳ μέχρι νῦν γενομένῳ, καὶ τάδε μοι πάντα τοὺς θεοὺς ἐς τὰ παρόντα συνενεγκεῖν εὔχομαι καὶ γενέσθαι τῇ πατρίδι κινδυνευούσῃ καθὰ καὶ περικτωμένῃ τὴν ἡγεμονίαν αἴσιος.	"I have not failed and I never will fail to fight with you and for you. I give you my services both as soldier and as general. If I have had any experience in war, if it has been my good fortune to remain unvanquished to this day, I pray the gods to continue all these blessings in our present need and that I may become a man of destiny for my country in her perils as I was in extending her dominion.
ἐγκέφαλος φοίνικος φοίνικος. Θεόφραστος περὶ φοίνικος τοῦ φυτοῦ εἰπὼν ἐπιφέρει· ἡ μὲν οὖν ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν φυτεία τοιαύτη τις·	Now with respect to what is called the Brain of the Palm.—Theophrastus, speaking of the plant of the palm-tree, states, The manner of cultivating it, and of its propagation from the fruit, is as follows
φιλοσοφία δέ, ἣν ἐγκωμιάζεις ἀεὶ καὶ ἀτίμως φῂς ὑπὸ τῶν λοιπῶν ἀνθρώπων φέρεσθαι, πῶς οὐ προδέδοται τὰ νῦν μετ’ ἐμοῦ μέρος ὅσον ἐπὶ σοὶ γέγονεν;	but as for Philosophy, which you are always belauding, and saying that she is treated with ignominy by the rest of mankind, surely, so far as it depends on you, she too is now betrayed as well as I.
εἰπέ μοι, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, οὐ ταὐτὸν καλεῖς τὸ ποιεῖν καὶ τὸ πράττειν;	Tell me, I said, do you not call making and doing the same?

τὸ γὰρ ἀρχαῖον, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, δυναστεία ἐν τῇ πόλει ἦν καὶ ἡ βασιλεία τῶν ἀεὶ ὑπερεχόντων διὰ τὸ αὐτόχθονας εἶναι, τὰς δὲ θυσίας ἁπάσας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔθυε, καὶ τὰς σεμνοτάτας καὶ ἀρρήτους ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐποίει, εἰκότως, βασίλιννα οὖσα.	In ancient times, men of Athens, there was sovereignty in our state, and the kingship belonged to those who were from time to time preeminent by reason of their being children of the soil, and the king offered all the sacrifices, and those which were holiest and which none might name his wife performed, as was natural, she being queen.
Ἐρομένου τινὸς τί ὑποτίθεσθαι δεῖ τῷ υἱῷ, τὸ τῆς Ἠλέκτρας, ἔφη, σῖγα, σῖγα, λεπτὸν ἴχνος.	When some one inquired of him what lesson he ought to give his son, Cleanthes in reply quoted words from the Electra
οὐ γὰρ ὡς ἀποθησόμενοι ἢ ἐπανορθώσοντες ἢ ἄλλ’ ἀντ’ αὐτῶν ληψόμενοι ἔρχεσθε.	For you do not come to lay aside, or correct, or change, your principles.
εἰ δὲ μήτε αὑτοῖς ἕτερά ἐστι μήτε τῷ ἑτέρῳ, οὐ πάντῃ ἤδη ἂν ἐκφεύγοι τὸ μὴ ἕτερα εἶναι ἀλλήλων;	But if they are not other than one another either by reason of themselves or by reason of the other, will it not be quite impossible for them to be other than one another at all?
ἤδη δέ φασιν οὐδ’ αὐτὸν ἀμελεῖν τοῦ τοιούτου μέρους, ἀλλὰ πολλάκις ἰδιώτου σχῆμα λαμβάνοντα καταμίγνυσθαι νύκτωρ εἰς τοὺς ὄχλους, καὶ πεῖραν αὐτῶν, ἣν ἔχουσιν ὑπὲρ τῆς ἀρχῆς, λαμβάνειν.	nay, it is reported that he did not himself neglect this part of caution, but that he would oftentimes himself take the habit of a private man, and mix among the multitude, in the night time, and make trial what opinion they had of his government
ἔτι δέ, ἄν τινες νόσοι προσπέσωσιν, ἐμποδίζουσιν ἡμῶν τὴν τοῦ ὄντος θήραν.	and moreover, if diseases come upon it they hinder our pursuit of the truth.
ταῦτα γὰρ ἅπαντα προσεῖναι δεῖ τοῖς καλῶς κειμένοις νόμοις.	for all these qualities should be found in wise legislation.
Δεκάτῳ δὲ ἔτει τῆς ἀρχῆς Ἀρχελάου οἱ πρῶτοι τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἔν τε Ἰουδαίοις καὶ Σαμαρεῦσι μὴ φέροντες τὴν ὠμότητα αὐτοῦ καὶ τυραννίδα κατηγοροῦσιν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Καίσαρος, καὶ μάλιστα ἐπεὶ ἔγνωσαν αὐτὸν παραβεβηκότα τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ἵνα ἐπιεικῶς ἀναστραφῇ τὰ πρὸς αὐτούς.	In the tenth year of the rule of Archelaus, the leading men of Judea and Samaria, finding his cruelty and tyranny intolerable, accused him before Caesar, particularly as they knew he had broken his mandate to act with fairness among them.
ὑμῖν δὲ τοιοῦτο μὲν οὐδὲν οὔτ’ ἦν μήτε γένοιτο τοῦ λοιποῦ, τοῦτο δ’ ἦν τὸ δεινότατον τοῦ πρὸς Φίλιππον πολέμου· οὐκ ἐδύνασθε κακῶς ἡλίκ’ ἐβούλεσθε ποιεῖν ἐκεῖνον·	No such disaster ever befell, nor, I hope, ever will befall, you. The worst misfortune of your war with Philip was that you could not do him as much harm as you wished
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ Ναθὰν τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰδεδεί, ἕνεκεν Κυρίου.	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his name Jedidiah because of the Lord.
τὸ δὲ ἀνδρείκελον ἐκ μηχανῆς ἐπεστρέφετο πάντῃ, καὶ σφαγαὶ τρεῖς καὶ εἴκοσιν ὤφθησαν ἀνά τε τὸ σῶμα πᾶν καὶ ἀνὰ τὸ πρόσωπον θηριωδῶς ἐς αὐτὸν γενόμεναι.	The image was turned round and round by a mechanical device, showing the twenty-three wounds in all parts of the body and on the face, which gave him a shocking appearance.
Πρὸς γὰρ θεραπηΐην οὐ γίνονται, σκοπέοντες διάθεσιν φθινώδεα, φυλασσόμενοι ἑτέρων ἰητρῶν ἐπεισαγωγὴν, ἐνόντες ἐν μισοπονηρίῃ βοηθήσιος.	For quacks do not attempt treatment when they see an alarming condition, and avoid calling in other physicians, because they wickedly hate help.
τοῖς δὲ πλείστοις ἦν δι’ ὑπονοίας.	though most people suspected who he was.
πρὸς ταῦτα Μαρκέλλου τοῦ ὑπάτου λῃστὴν ἀποκαλοῦντος τὸν Καίσαρα, καὶ ψηφίζεσθαι πολέμιον κελεύοντος εἰ μὴ καταθήσεται τὰ ὅπλα, Κουρίων ὅμως ἴσχυσε μετὰ Ἀντωνίου καὶ Πείσωνος ἐξελέγξαι τὴν σύγκλητον, ἐκέλευσε γὰρ μεταστῆναι τοὺς Καίσαρα μόνον τὰ ὅπλα καταθέσθαι κελεύοντας, Πομπήϊον δὲ ἄρχειν·	To this Marcellus the consul replied by calling Caesar a robber, and urging that he be voted a public enemy unless he should lay down his arms nevertheless, Curio, aided by Antony and Piso, prevailed so far as to have the opinion of the senate taken. He therefore moved that those should withdraw to one side who wished that Caesar only should lay down his arms and that Pompey should remain in command
οὔκ, ἀλλ’ οὕτω ταῦτά γε καὶ οὐκ ἄλλως ἂν συμβαίνοι γιγνόμενα.	No, you need not remind me those things occur just as you suggest.
Καὶ ἀπολύσας τοὺς ὄχλους ἐνέβη εἰς τὸ πλοῖον, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὰ ὅρια Μαγδαλά.	And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.
ὁ δὲ Φίλιππος οὐκ ἔφη τὸν λόγον αὑτῷ καθήκειν, ἀλλ’ ἐκείνῳ·	Philip however said that "The word was not with himself but with Flamininus
τέγξις μὲν ὦν ἔλαιον ξὺν χαμαιμήλῳ ἑψηθὲν ἢ νάρδῳ·	For bathing, oil boiled with camomile or nard
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ ὁρῶν ἐνίους τῶν πολιτῶν ἀπὸ ἱπποτροφίας δοκοῦντας εἶναι τινας καὶ μέγα φρονοῦντας, ἔπεισε τὴν ἀδελφὴν Κυνίσκαν ἅρμα καθεῖσαν Ὀλυμπίασιν ἀγωνίσασθαι, βουλόμενος ἐνδείξασθαι τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ὡς οὐδεμιᾶς ἐστιν ἀρετῆς, ἀλλὰ πλούτου καὶ δαπάνης ἡ νίκη.	However, on seeing that some of the citizens esteemed themselves highly and were greatly lifted up because they bred racing horses, he persuaded his sister Cynisca to enter a chariot in the contests at Olympia, wishing to show the Greeks that the victory there was not a mark of any great excellence, but simply of wealth and lavish outlay.

οὐκοῦν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, ἔτι ἓν λείπεται, τὸ ἢν πείσωμεν ὑμᾶς ὡς χρὴ ἡμᾶς ἀφεῖναι;	Why, is there not left, said I, the alternative of our persuading you that you ought to let us go?
μετὰ γὰρ τὸ πρῶτον εὔλογον καὶ ἀναγκαῖον δεύτερόν τι εἶναι, καὶ εἰ δεύτερον, τρίτον, καὶ οὕτω δὴ τὰ ἄλλα ἐφεξῆς ἅμα δ’ ἀμφότερα λέγειν, μονάδα τε μετὰ τὸ ἓν πρώτην εἶναι καὶ δευτέραν, καὶ δυάδα πρώτην, ἀδύνατον.	For it is reasonable and indeed necessary that after the first there should be a second and if a second, a third and so on with the rest in sequence. But the two statements, that there is after 1 a first and a second unit, and that there is a first 2, are incompatible.
καὶ δὴ καὶ τῆς Ἐφεσίας Ἀρτέμιδος κἀνταῦθα ἱδρύσαντο ἱερόν, χωρίον ἀπολαβόντες ὃ ποιεῖ νῆσον τὰ στόματα τοῦ ποταμοῦ.	they have even erected a temple to Diana of Ephesus on a piece of the land, which the mouths of the rivers have formed into an island.
ἔτι δὲ προσδεῖται χρόνου καὶ συνηθείας·	Moreover they require time and intimacy

τεκτονικὸν μὲν γὰρ ἢ χαλκευτικὸν ἢ γεωργικὸν ἢ ἀνθρώπων ἀρχικὸν ἢ τῶν τοιούτων ἔργων ἐξεταστικὸν ἢ λογιστικὸν ἢ οἰκονομικὸν ἢ στρατηγικὸν γενέσθαι, πάντα τὰ τοιαῦτα μαθήματα καὶ ἀνθρώπου γνώμῃ αἱρετὰ ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι·	For the craft of carpenter, smith, farmer or ruler, and the theory of such crafts, and arithmetic and economics and generalship might be learned and mastered by the application of human powers
ὅτι ἐμπλησθήσεται ἡ γῆ τοῦ γνῶναι τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου, ὡς ὕδωρ κατακαλύψει αὐτούς.	Because the earth shall be filled with knowing the glory of the Lord; like water it will cover them.
μετασχηματίσας γὰρ ἑαυτὸν Δαυίδης καὶ ποιήσας ἐπιτήδειον εἰς τὴν τοῦ πλήθους θέαν πρὸς ταῖς πύλαις ἐκάθισεν, ὡς ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν ἀκούσαντα συνδραμεῖν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ κατασπάσασθαι.	So David changed his habit, and exposed himself in a manner fit to be seen by the multitude, and sat at the gates whereupon all the people heard of it, and ran together to him, and saluted him.
καὶ Ἀρτάβανος πέμπει Τιβερίῳ ὅμηρον Δαρεῖον τὸν υἱὸν μετὰ πολλῶν δώρων, ἐν οἷς καὶ ἄνδρα ἑπτάπηχυν τὸ μέγεθος Ἰουδαῖον τὸ γένος Ἐλεάζαρον ὄνομα:	Not long afterwards, Artabanus sent his son Darius as a hostage, with many gifts, among which was a man seven feet tall, a Jew by birth, nameed Eleazar, who was called a giant on account of his height.
συντήκονται δ’ αὐτῶν αἱ θήλειαι μετὰ τὸν τόκον καὶ παρίενται·	Their females waste away after laying their eggs, and get powerless
διὸ δή μοι καὶ δοκοῦσιν ἀμαθῶς πάνυ τὴν εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα στοιχεῖα τῶν ἁπλῶν ἀγγείων εἰσάγειν διάλυσιν ἔνιοι τῶν Ἐρασιστρατείων.	For this reason some of the Erasistrateans seem to me to have done very foolishly in reducing the simple vessels to elements such as these.
Ἐγένοντο δὲ φίλοι ὅ τε Πιλάτος καὶ ὁ Ἡρῴδης ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετ' ἀλλήλων· προϋπῆρχον γὰρ ἐν ἔχθρᾳ ὄντες πρὸς ἑαυτούς.	That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.
οἱ γὰρ ἱππεῖς, ὅσοι τῶν βαρβάρων, πρὶν ἀφικέσθαι Λεύκολλον, ἐπὶ χορτολογίαν προεληλύθεσαν, οὐκ ἔχοντες ἐσελθεῖν ἐς τὴν πόλιν Λευκόλλου περικαθημένου, περιθέοντες ἐβόων καὶ συνετάρασσον· καὶ συνεπήχουν οἱ ἔνδον αὐτοῖς.	A body of the enemy's horse who had gone out foraging before Lucullus arrived, returned and not finding any entrance to the city because it was surrounded by the besiegers, ran about shouting and creating disturbance while those inside the walls shouted back.
ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ ἔχθρας, σὺ δὲ φιλίας ἄρχεις. καὶ ταῦτα μὲν εἰς αὐτὸν ἀναφέρεται.	For the quarrel was of my beginning, you make the first move to friendship.
Ἡσίοδος δὲ τὸν Πελασγὸν αὐτόχθονά φησιν εἶναι.	However, Hesiod says that Pelasgus was a son of the soil.
Βοσάρα μὲν ἐπὶ τοῖς ὁρίοις τῆς Ἀραβίας, Ἀρίμανον δὲ τῆς Γαλαδηνῶν γῆς, καὶ Γαυλανὰν δ’ ἐν τῇ Βατανίδι.	Bezer, at the borders of Arabia Ramoth, of the land of Gilead and Golan, in the land of Bashan.
πάθη γὰρ ἀντίπαλα καὶ βίαια κατεῖχε κινήματα πάντα τόπον.	For conflicting emotions and violent disturbances prevailed everywhere.
φανέντων δὲ πᾶσι τούτοις ἀδυνάτων ἀπέστησαν, καθάπερ Κλείσοφος ὁ Σηλυμβριανός.	but when they got near enough to touch them, they desisted just as Clisophus the Salymbrian did.
οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπόλιμμα τοῖς βρώμασιν αὐτοῦ, διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀνθήσει αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀγαθά.	There was no remainder of his food. Because of this, his good things shall not flourish.
αὐτήν τε σωφροσύνην καὶ δικαιοσύνην, τὴν μὲν περὶ τὰ συμβόλαια μήτε πλέον νέμουσαν αὑτῇ τοῦ προσήκοντος μήτ’ ἔλαττον, τὴν δ’ εἰς τὸ μέσον ἀπαθείας καὶ ἀναισθησίας καὶ ἀκολασίας ἀεὶ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας καθιστᾶσαν.	and temperance itself and justice are means, the latter distributing to itself in contracts neither more nor less than what is due, the former ever regulating the desires to a mean between lack of feeling and intemperance.
προσιόντος δὲ τοῦ Σύλλα πρὸς τὴν Χαιρώνειαν ὁ τεταγμένος ἐν τῇ πόλει χιλίαρχος, ἐξωπλισμένους ἄγων τοὺς στρατιώτας, ἀπήντησε στέφανον δάφνης κομίζων.	As Sulla drew near to Chaeroneia, the tribune who had been stationed in the city, with his men in full armour, came to meet him, carrying a wreath of laurel.
πῶς γάρ; ᾗ γε μηδὲ πρὸς θεοὺς ἔξεστ’ ἀκλαύστῳ τῆσδ’ ἀποστῆναι στέγης.	How could you, when you cannot leave this house even to worship the gods without later regretting it?
εἰδῶμεν εἰ νικῶμεν, ἢ νικώμεθα·	Let us know if we are victors or vanquished
Σελεύκου μεταλλάξαντος τὸν βίον, ὃς ἦν Ἀντιόχου τοῦ προειρημένου πατήρ, διαδεξαμένου δὲ τὴν βασιλείαν Σελεύκου πρεσβυτάτου τῶν υἱῶν, ἅμα τούτῳ διὰ τὴν οἰκειότητα συνυπερέβαλε τὸν Ταῦρον, δυσὶ μάλιστά πως ἔτεσι πρότερον τῶν νῦν λεγομένων καιρῶν.	After the death of Seleucus, father of the above-named Antiochus, and the succession of his eldest son Seleucus to the throne, Achaeus accompanied the latter in an expedition over Mount Taurus, about two years before the period of which we are speaking.
τοσοῦτον δὲ μόνον ὑπὲρ ἑκάστου εἶπον, ὅσον ἐξορμήσει τε τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας, εἰ μὴ παντάπασιν εἶεν σκαιοί, τοῖς τῶν παλαιῶν ὁμιλῆσαι γράμμασι καὶ τὴν εἰς τὸ Ῥᾷον αὐτοῖς συνεῖναι βοήθειαν παρέξει.	I have said only so much regarding each of the humours as will stir up the reader, unless he be absolutely inept, to make himself familiar with the writings of the Ancients, and will help him to gain more easy access to them.
Τῶν δ' ἑξακόσιοι μὲν εὐθὺς ἑάλωσαν, ὅσοι δ' εἰς τὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ τὰς ἐκεῖ Θήβας διέφυγον, οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν συλληφθέντες ἐπανήχθησαν.	Six hundred of them were caught immediately, and soon all those who had fled to Egypt and to the Egyptian Thebaid were caught and brought back.
λέγει γάρ · λιθάργυρος δ’ ὄλπη παρῃωρεῖτο χρίματος πλέα τὸν Σπαρτιάτην γραπτὸν κύρβιν ἐν διπλῷ ξύλῳ.	For he says, A cruet of litharge full of ointment was suspended from a Spartan tablet, written upon and twisted on a double stick
ὅσπερ τῇ φυλακῇ ἐφειστήκει τοῦ Ἀγρίππου, θεώμενος τήν τε σπουδὴν μεθ' οἵας ὁ Μαρσύας ἀφίκετο καὶ τὸ ἐκ τῶν λόγων χάρμα τῷ Ἀγρίππᾳ συνελθόν, ὑποτοπήσας καίνωσίν τινα γεγονέναι τῶν λόγων ἤρετό σφας περὶ τοῦ λόγου τοῦ ἐφεστηκότος.	The centurion who was serving as guard to Agrippa, when he saw how hastily Marsyas had come and Agrippa's joy at what he said, suspected that his words implied some great change in affairs and he asked them what it was about.
ἢ γὰρ οὐχ ὁρᾷς, εἶπεν, ὦ; φίλε Διογενιανέ, τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν, ὅτε πεῖσαι βούλεται τοὺς Ἀχαιούς, τὸν Ὀδυσσέα παρακαλοῦσαν, ὅτε συγχέαι τὰ ὅρκια, τὸν Πάνδαρον ζητοῦσαν, ὅτε τρέψασθαι τοὺς Τρῶας, ἐπὶ τὸν Διομήδην βαδίζουσαν;	Thus, dost thou not find it to be true, friend Diogenianus, that when Minerva would persuade the Greeks to undertake any enterprise, she brings Ulysses upon the stage?—when she designs to break the truce, she finds out Pandarus?—when she designs a rout of the Trojans, she addresses herself to Diomede?
καθ’ ἡμέραν δὲ παραδόξως αὐξανομένου τοῦ Δημοφῶντος τοῦτο γὰρ ἦν ὄνομα τῷ παιδί ἐπετήρησεν ἡ Πραξιθέα, καὶ καταλαβοῦσα εἰς πῦρ ἐγκεκρυμμένον ἀνεβόησε·	But as Demophon — for that was the child's name— grew marvelously by day, Praxithea watched, and discovering him buried in the fire she cried out
ἢν γὰρ τούτοις ἀρέσκῃς, ἅπαν ὅ τι ἂν πράξῃς οὐ πρὸς τὴν ἀλήθειαν κρινοῦσιν ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸ σοὶ συμφέρον ὑπολήψονται, καὶ τὰ μὲν ἁμαρτανόμενα παρόψονται, τὸ δὲ κατορθωθὲν οὐρανόμηκες ποιήσουσιν·	For if you please the people in Athens, no matter what you do they will not judge your conduct by the facts but will construe it in a light favorable to you and if you make mistakes, they will overlook them, while if you succeed, they will exalt your success to the high heaven.
Παρέμεινε δὲ συνεχῶς τοξεύων Καῖσαρ καὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους κωλύων παρελθεῖν, μέχρι πάντες ἀνεχώρησαν οἱ στρατιῶται.	Continually shooting arrows, Caesar held the Jews at bay until all his soldiers had retreated.
νυκτερεύει δὲ παρὰ τῷ πρεσβυτάτῳ·	The woman however passes the night with the eldest.
γίγνονται γάρ τινες ἡμῖν ἐκ τῶν καθ’ ἡμέραν συμποσίων ἐπιπόλαιοι δριμύτητες·	For there are some little roughnesses on the surface, arising from daily banquets
Παραγενόμενοι δὲ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἀπεδέχθησαν ὑπὸ τῆς ἐκκλησίας καὶ τῶν ἀποστόλων καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ἀνήγγειλάν τε ὅσα ὁ θεὸς ἐποίησεν μετ' αὐτῶν.	And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them.
ὁ δὲ Ζακύνθιος καὶ ὁ Λευκάδιος διὰ τὸ γύψον λαβεῖν καὶ κεφαλὴν ἀδικοῦσιν.	The Zacynthian and Leucadian wines also are apt to be bad for the head, because they contain chalk.
Συννοήσας δὲ Καῖσαρ τὴν ἀπάτην πρὸς βλάβης μὲν ἔγνω τὸν ἐν πολέμοις ἔλεον, τὸ γὰρ ἀπηνέστερον ἧττον ὑποπίπτειν τῷ πανούργῳ, τὰς δ' ἐμβολὰς τῆς ἑλεπόλεως ὀργῇ τῆς χλεύης ἐποιεῖτο δυνατωτέρας.	When Caesar saw that it was a ruse, he saw how dangerous mercy is in war for there is less room for such ruses under a more severe regime. So in his anger at the deceit he set the battering-ram to work more strongly than before.
ζηλωτὴς δ’ ἐγένετο Ὑπερείδου ἢ ὥς τινες διὰ τὸ παθητικὸν Δημοσθένους καὶ τὸ σφοδρόν·	He was a zealous follower of Hypereides or, as some say on account of his emotional and vehement qualities, of Demosthenes.
καὶ τοῦτο πέρας οὐκ ἦν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ τοὺς μὲν ἐξεκήρυττον ἀκρίτους, τοὺς δὲ συλλαμβάνοντες ἀπεκτίννυσαν ἐν οἷς καὶ Διοφάνης ὁ ῥήτωρ ἀπώλετο.	Nor was this all they banished some of his friends without a trial and others they arrested and put to death. Among these Diophanes the rhetorician also perished.
ἔστι δὲ ὁ λόγος οὗτος ἐναντίος τῷ περὶ τοῦ Κλεωνύμου κλήρου· ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ ὑπὲρ συγγενείας εἶπεν, ὧδε δὲ ὑπὲρ διαθήκης. ἡ στάσις ἀντίληψις κατὰ στοχασμόν·	The speech, which is in defence of a will, is the counterpart of that delivered “On the Estate of Cleonymus,” which upholds the rights of kindred. The discussion concerns a point of law with a controversy on a point of fact
ἐδήλωσαν δὲ μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων καλῶν καὶ τιμητείας αὐτὸν ἀξιώσαντες, ἥτις ἐστὶν ἀρχὴ πασῶν ἱερωτάτη καὶ δυναμένη μέγα πρός τε τἆλλα καὶ πρός ἐξέτασιν βίων.	And they made this manifest by conferring upon him, along with his other honours, that of the censorship, which is of all offices most sacred, and of great influence, both in other ways, and especially because it examines into the lives and conduct of men.
καὶ σὺ οὖν ἐκείναις λέγε ὅτι ἀντὶ κυνὸς εἶ φύλαξ καὶ ἐπιμελητής, καὶ διὰ σὲ οὐδ’ ὑφ’ ἑνὸς ἀδικούμεναι ἀσφαλῶς τε καὶ ἡδέως ἐργαζόμεναι ζῶσιν.	Do you then tell these women that you are their watch-dog and keeper, and it is due to you that they live and work in safety and comfort, with none to harm them.
Ἰούλιος δὲ Καῖσαρ ὁ πρῶτος πάντων ἀνθρώπων περαιωθεὶς ἐπὶ τὰς Βρεττανίδας νήσους μετὰ χιλίων σκαφῶν τρεῖς οἰκέτας τοὺς πάντας συνεπήγετο, ὡς Κόττας ἱστορεῖ ὁ τότε ὑποστρατηγῶν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ περὶ τῆς Ῥωμαίων πολιτείας συγγράμματι , ὃ τῇ πατρίῳ ἡμῶν γέγραπται φωνῇ.	And Julius Cæsar, the first man who ever crossed over to the British isles with a thousand vessels, had with him only three servants altogether, as Cotta, who at that time acted as his lieutenant-general, relates in his treatise on the History and Constitution of the Romans, which is written in our national language.
ἴτ’, ὦ τᾳἰχεῖαι ποίνιμοί τ’ Ἐριννύες, γεύεσθε, μὴ φείδεσθε πανδήμου στρατοῦ.	Come, you swift and punishing Erinyes, devour all the assembled army and spare nothing!
τῶν δὲ ἐπιχωρίων Ἑρμάων βουλομένης Ἰοῦς λαθὼν κτείνει τὸν Ἄργον, ἡ δὲ ὧδε ἐλευθερωθεῖσα φεύγει σὺν τοῖς πράξασιν ἐπιβᾶσα νεὼς φορτίδος, ὑπὸ δὲ χειμῶνος φορηθεῖσα ἀνὰ τὸ πέλαγος, ὃ καλεῖται Ἰόνιον, καὶ πολλαχοῦ προσπελασθεῖσα εἰς Ἀερίαν ἐκομίσθη καὶ θεὸς ἐνομίσθη διὰ τὸ κάλλος.	But, at Io’s request, a local man named Hermaon killed Argos without being seen. Io, now free, fled with her accomplices and boarded a merchant ship. She was carried by a storm over that sea which is now called ‘Ionian’, and she passed many places until she came safely to Aeria, where she was thought a goddess on account of her beauty.
πλείω μὲν ἀπολογεῖσθαι δυνάμεθα, λόγον δ' οὐκ ἐπιδέχεται τὰ μὴ γενόμενα.	We are willing to defend ourselves further, but actions never done cannot be discussed.
τούτων πολλοὶ μὲν μέμνηνται, ὡς καὶ Ἀριστοφάνης.	A great many authors mention this bird, as also does Aristophanes.
καὶ ἐρεῖς τὰ δικαιώματά μου τῇ ἀνόμῳ ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ τὰ νόμιμά μου τῶν χωρῶν τῶν κύκλῳ αὐτῆς, διότι τὰ δικαιώματά μου ἀπώσαντο, καὶ ἐν τοῖς νομίμοις μου οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς.	And you shall declare my ordinances to the lawless one from the nations, and my statutes to the lawless one from those countries surrounding her, because they spurned my ordinances, and they did not walk in my statutes.”
καίτοι πῶς ἂν γένοιτο ἄνθρωπος μιαρώτερος;	yet, could there be an example of more abject vileness?
μεριζόμενοι δὲ εἰς τὴν χώραν κατὰ λόχους διήρπαζόν τε τὰς τῶν δυνατῶν οἰκίας καὶ αὐτοὺς ἀνῄρουν καὶ τὰς κώμας ἐνεπίμπρασαν, ὥστε τῆς ἀπονοίας αὐτῶν πᾶσαν τὴν Ἰουδαίαν ἀναπίμπλασθαι.	for they parted themselves into different bodies, and lay in wait up and down the country, and plundered the houses of the great men, and slew the men themselves, and set the villages on fire and this till all Judea was filled with the effects of their madness.
ταύτῃ γὰρ τό τε πρῶτον ἦν ἔρυμα χθαμαλώτερον καὶ τὸ δεύτερον οὐ συνῆπτεν ἀμελησάντων καθὰ μὴ λίαν ἡ καινὴ πόλις συνῴκιστο τειχίζειν, ἀλλ' ἐπὶ τὸ τρίτον ἦν εὐπέτεια, δι' οὗ τὴν ἄνω πόλιν καὶ διὰ τῆς Ἀντωνίας τὸ ἱερὸν αἱρήσειν ἐπενόει.	There the first part of the wall was lower and the second was not joined to it, as the builders neglecting to build it strong as there were not many living in the new city. Here too, there was easy access to the third wall, through which he planned to take the upper city, and, through the Antonia tower, the temple itself.
ὡς καὶ τὸ Ὁμηρικὸν ἔχει· κεῖτ’ ἔντοσθ’ ἄντροιο τανυσσάμενος διὰ μήλων.	And, indeed, Homer uses the preposition διὰ in the same way, for he says— He lay within the cave stretch'd o'er the sheep (διὰ μήλων)
ὁ δ’ ὅρκος ἔσται, μήποτ’ Ἀργείους χθόνα ἐς τήνδ’ ἐποίσειν πολέμιον παντευχίαν, ἄλλων τ’ ἰόντων ἐμποδὼν θήσειν δόρυ.	And this shall be the form thereof We Argives swear we never will against this land lead on our mail-clad troops to war, and, if others come, we will repel them.
καὶ Ἀσκληπιὸν Κοτυλέα ὠνόμασεν ἀκεσθεὶς τὸ τραῦμα τὸ ἐς τὴν κοτύλην οἱ γενόμενον ἐν τῇ πρὸς Ἱπποκόωντα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας προτέρᾳ μάχῃ.	it was made by Heracles, who named Asclepius Cotyleus, because he was cured of the wound in the hip-joint that he received in the former fight with Hippocoon and his sons.
γενόμενος δ' εἰς τὰ Ἱεροσόλυμα τῶν μὲν προτέρων ἁμαρτημάτων περὶ τὸν θεὸν καὶ τὴν μνήμην ἐσπούδαζεν, εἰ δυνατὸν αὐτῷ γένοιτο, τῆς ψυχῆς ἐκβαλεῖν, ὧν ἐπιβουλεύειν ὥρμησε καὶ πάσῃ χρῆσθαι περὶ αὐτὸν δεισιδαιμονίᾳ:	When he arrived in Jerusalem, he did what he could to expel from mind his former sins against God, of which he now repented, and to apply himself to a devout life.
οἷς τε γὰρ ἡ χώρα κατεσκεύασται, τὰ πολλὰ πρὸς ὑμᾶς τὰ μὲν ληφθέντα, τὰ δ’ αὐτόματα ἥξει·	Whatsoever the territory is furnished withal will come most of it unto you, partly taken and partly of its own accord.
ὁ λέγων γὰρ αὐτῷ χαίρειν, κοινωνεῖ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς πονηροῖς.¶	because the person who gives him a greeting shares in his evil deeds.
ἢ φανερὸν ὅτι τὰ μὲν μιμήσεται τὴν προτέραν πολιτείαν, τὰ δὲ τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν, ἅτ’ ἐν μέσῳ οὖσα, τὸ δέ τι καὶ αὑτῆς ἕξει ἴδιον;	Is it not obvious that in some things it will imitate the preceding polity, in some the oligarchy, since it is intermediate, and that it will also have some qualities peculiar to itself?
καὶ τὰ μὲν κατὰ τὴν Ἰβηρίαν ἐν τούτοις ἦν.	Such was the position of affairs in Iberia.
πῶς ἔτλης οἶος τεκέειν γλαυκῶπιν Ἀθήνην;	How dared you by yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena?
οὗτοι δῆμοι υἱῶν Γὰδ ἐξ ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν, τέσσαρες καὶ τεσσεράκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ πεντακόσιοι.	These are the clans of the sons of Gad according to their numbering: ⌊forty-four⌋ thousand five hundred.
ταῦτ’ ἐπαινέσας ὁ Σύλλας προσεῖπε περὶ τῶν Πυθαγορικῶν, ὡς μάλιστα μὲν ἐγεύοντο τῶν ἱεροθύτων ἀπαρξάμενοι τοῖς θεοῖς·	Sylla commended this discourse, and added concerning the Pythagoreans, that they then chiefly tasted flesh when they sacrificed to the Gods.
οὐ γὰρ οἴνου μὲν ἔστι πρὸς ὕδωρ ἑτέρου ἑτέρα μῖξις, ἣν οἱ βασιλικοὶ γιγνώσκοντες οἰνοχόοι νῦν μὲν πλέον νῦν δ’ ἔλαττον ὑποχέουσιν·	for it is not to be supposed the water bears various proportions to different sorts of wine (which kings’ cup-bearers understanding sometimes pour in more, sometimes less), and that man hath no such relation to them.
υἱοὶ Ἰερειχώ, τριακόσιοι τεσσεράκοντα πέντε·	descendants of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five;
τὸ γὰρ ἐσλεύσσειν οἰκεῖα πάθη, μηδενὸς ἄλλου παραπράξαντος, μεγάλας ὀδύνας ὑποτείνει.	To look on self-made suffering, when no other has had a hand in it—this induces sharp pains.
οἱ δ’ Ἀργεῖοι καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὡς εἶδον αὐτούς, καταλαβόντες χωρίον ἐρυμνὸν καὶ δυσπρόσοδον παρετάξαντο ὡς ἐς μάχην.	Here they were seen by the Argives and their allies, who immediately took up a strong and difficult position, and formed in order of battle.
τῶν δὲ παριαμβίδων Ἐπίχαρμος ἐν Περιάλλῳ μνημονεύει οὕτως · Σεμέλα δὲ χορεύει· καὶ ὑπᾴδει σφιν σοφὸς κιθάρᾳ παριαμβίδας·	The instrument called pariambis is mentioned by Epicharmus, in his Periallus, in this way— But Semele doth dance and he doth sing Tunefully on his pariambis lyre, And she rejoices at the rapid song.
πολλῷ γάρ ἐστιν ἡ χαρὰ τῆς κωμικῆς ἐκείνης ἀγρυπνίας λαλίστερον, ἀναρριπίζουσα πολλάκις ἑαυτὴν καὶ πρόσφατον ποιοῦσα τοῖς διηγήμασιν.	For to say truth, gladness and joy are much more loquacious than the sleeplessness so often feigned in their comedies, rousing up and still refreshing itself with new relations
ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτόνομός τε διετέλεσε καὶ πολλοῖς ἀναθήμασιν ἐκοσμήθη, ἃ κεῖται τὰ μὲν πλεῖστα ἐν τῷ Διονυσίῳ καὶ τῷ γυμνασίῳ, ἄλλα δ’ ἐν ἄλλοις τόποις.	hence also the city was suffered to preserve her independence, and was embellished with many votive offerings. These are distributed in various places, but the greatest part of them are deposited in the Dionysium and in the gymnasium.
καὶ μετ’ ὀλίγα· Στράτιε, φιλεῖς δήπου με. ς.	And a little afterwards he says— A. Oh Stratius, dost thou love me?
ὅ τι δ’ ἂν πρὸς ταῦτα λέγῃ ἀπαγγεῖλαι δεῦρο· ἡμᾶς δ’ ἀκούσαντας πρὸς ταῦτα βουλεύεσθαι.	I propose, further, that our representatives should report back to us whatever reply he may make, and that we after hearing it should deliberate about the matter.
κατεύθυνεν πρὸς Κύριον τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, ἐν ἡμέραις ἀνόμων κατίσχυσεν τὴν εὐσέβειαν.	He directed his heart toward the Lord; he strengthened godliness in the days of lawless people.
καίτοι φέρε λέγειν τινὰ ἡμῶν ὡς τύχη τὰ τῶν βλεπόντων πράγματα, οὐκ ὄψις οὐδ’ ὄμματα φωσφόρα φησὶ Πλάτων, καὶ τύχη τὰ τῶν ἀκουόντων, οὐ δύναμις ἀντιληπτικὴ πληγῆς ἀέρος δι’ ὠτὸς καὶ ἐγκεφάλου προσφερομένης·	Yet, suppose someone among us should say that the act of seeing is chance and not vision nor the use of light-bringing orbs, as Plato calls the eyes, and that the act of hearing is chance and not a faculty apperceptive of a vibration in the air which is carried onward through ear and brain.
δι’ ὃν καὶ Ἀναξίλας ἐν Νηρεῖ ἔφη · καίτοι πολύ γ’ ἐσθ’ ἥδιον.	And, perhaps, it was on account of Hesiod that Anaxilas said, in his Nereus,— And this is much more pleasant
εἰρήνης δ' ἡ χώρα λαβομένη ἀνέδραμέ τε πάλιν εἰς τὴν προτέραν κατάστασιν καὶ εὐθήνησε.	Once the land was at peace it returned to its former condition and flourished again.
καὶ γάρ ἐσθ’ ὑπηρέτας· κώμῳ ὁ μόνον θυραμάχοις τε πυγμαχίαισι νέων θέλοι παροίνων ἔμμεναι στρατηλάτας.	For that is but the handmaid Of revels, where men combat at the doors, And fight with heavy fists.
καὶ μὴν εἰ μὲν ἅπαντ’ ἠξίους, ὅσα πράττεις τῇ πόλει, σαυτῷ πιστεύειν, οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως κλέπτης ὢν ἐφωρῶ·	Now if you, sir, had claimed our entire confidence in all your public business, your dishonesty would not have been equally manifest
ἐν τούτῳ δὲ θνήσκει Σερτώριος ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων δολοφονηθείς·	But in the meantime Sertorius was treacherously killed by his friends, and Perpenna, the ringleader among them, attempted to carry on his work.
Τιμοθέῳ μὲν γὰρ ᾄδοντι τὴν Ἄρτεμιν ἐν τῷ θεάτρῳ μαινάδα θυιάδα φοιβάδα λυσσάδα Κινησίας εὐθὺς ἀντεφώνησε τοιαύτη σοι θυγάτηρ γένοιτο.	And when Timotheus, in a song in the theatre, spoke of Artemis as Ecstatic Bacchic frantic fanatic, Cinesias at once shouted back, May you have a daughter like that I Neat too is Bion s retort to Theognis, who said
ἐγὼ τοίνυν ἑκὼν ὑμῖν ἐξίσταμαι τῆς φιλίας, ἐπεί τοι μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅ τι ζημιωθήσομαι μὴ ξυνὼν ὑμῖν·	I therefore willingly resign your friendship, since, by Heaven, I cannot see what penalty I shall suffer by not associating with you
Εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς ἐκκλησίας θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται;	But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?
νῦν δὲ παρὰ σοῦ ἤδη ἀνεδιδάχθημεν ὅτι εἰ μὲν δύο ἀμφότεροί ἐσμεν, δύο καὶ ἑκάτερον ἡμῶν ἀνάγκη εἶναι, εἰ δὲ εἷς ἑκάτερος, ἕνα καὶ ἀμφοτέρους ἀνάγκη·	But now we have been taught by you that if we are both two, then each of us is inevitably two, and if each is one, then both are inevitably one
ἐξαρκεῖν δὲ καὶ αὐτῷ πρὸς τὴν Ἀντιγόνου καθαίρεσιν.	and that he was able of himself to beat Antigonus.
εἰσὶ δ’ οἳ τὴν Ἐλπινίκην οὐ κρύφα τῷ Κίμωνι, φανερῶς δὲ γημαμένην συνοικῆσαι λέγουσιν, ἀξίου τῆς εὐγενείας νυμφίου διὰ τὴν πενίαν ἀποροῦσαν·	Still, there are some who say that Elpinice did not live with Cimon in secret intercourse, but openly rather, as his wedded wife, because, on account of her poverty, she could not get a husband worthy of her high lineage
ὑποδήματα δὲ ὑπὸ τοῖς ποσίν ἐστιν αὐτῷ, καὶ τῷ ἑτέρῳ ποδὶ ἐπὶ κρανίου βέβηκε βοός.	On his feet are sandals, and one foot stands upon the skull of an ox.
ὅσοι μὲν οὖν τῶν ξένων μὴ ἐγίγνωσκον ἡμέτερα ὄντα, τὴν πομπὴν τὴν κοινὴν ὁρῶντες ὑστέραν οὖσαν τῆς Ἀλκιβιάδου τοῖς τούτου πομπείοις χρῆσθαι ἐνόμιζον ἡμᾶς·	Naturally, when those strangers who did not know that they belonged to us saw the state-procession taking place after that of Alcibiades, they imagined that we were using his vessels
εἶχε γὰρ ἄν τι τούτων τῶν χρωμάτων·	It must necessarily have been colorless, since otherwise it would have had one of these colors.
κἀκεῖνος ἡσυχῆ διαμειδιάσας οὕτως εἶπεν ὥστε καὶ σοὶ προσεγκαλεῖν τὰ μικρότατα τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν πλημμελημάτων ἐλέγχοντι. καθάπερ γὰρ ὁ Σωκράτης;	In the same manner, and as easily, replied Serapio, as I may charge and accuse yourself for reproaching the slightest faults among the Greeks.
Καὶ οὔτε τῶν τρεπομένων οὔτε τῶν προσβαινόντων τις ὀρθὸς ἔμενεν, ἀλλ' οἱ μὲν ἐπ' αὐτῶν ὑπτιαζόμενοι τῶν ἐπιβατηρίων μηχανῶν συνεπατοῦντο, πολλοὶ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ χῶμα κατέπιπτον.	so that neither those coming up nor those going down could stand upright, but some fell backward upon their climbing machines and were trodden upon and many fell down upon the earthworks,
ἀπόκριναι οὖν καὶ τὰ λοιπά, ἵνα ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος κεφαλὴν λάβῃ.	So proceed with the rest of your answers, that our argument may pick up a head.
τινὰς δὲ καὶ ἀπειθούσας ἐξεπολιόρκει, καὶ τῶν ἐν αὐταῖς Ῥωμαίων τοὺς μὲν ἐπιφανεῖς ἔκτεινε, τοὺς δὲ δημότας καὶ δούλους ἐστράτευε.	Some that did not submit he besieged, and he put to death the principal Roman citizens in them, but the common people and the slaves he enrolled in his army.
καὶ μὴν ἐγκρατέστατός γ’ ἐστὶν ὧν ἐγὼ οἶδα τῶν περὶ τὸ σῶμα ἡδονῶν· ὥστε οὐδὲ διὰ ταῦτα ἀσχολίαν ἔχει τὸ μὴ πράττειν ἀεὶ τὸ δεόμενον.	Again, he has greater self-control than any man I know as regards the pleasures of the body, so that he is not prevented by such things, either, from doing always what needs to be done.
σοὶ δ’, ὦ πάντων ἀνοσιώτατε ἀνθρώπων, τάφον ἀντὶ θαλάμου καὶ γάμου παρασκευαζέτωσαν οἱ προσήκοντες.	And for thee, the lewdest person among men, let thy relations prepare a sepulchre, instead of a bride-chamber and nuptials.
ἐπεί, ὅτι γε μετέχει τινὸς εὐχυμίας τὸ ξύλον, ἐκεῖνοἔφηποιοῦμαι σημεῖον, ὃ λέγουσιν οἱ κηπουροί· λέγουσι γουσι δὲ τοῦ πηγάνου τὸ φυόμενον ὑπ’ αὐτῇ καὶ παραφυτευόμενον ἣδιον εἶναι καὶ τῷ χυμῷ μαλακώτερον, ὡς ἂν ἀπολαῦόν τινὸς γλυκύτητος, κατασβέννυται τἄγαν βαρὺ καὶ κατάκορον, εἰ μὴ νὴ Δία τοὐναντίον ἡ συκῆ περισπῶσα τὴν τροφὴν ἐξαιρεῖ τὸ τῆς δριμύτητος.	For that this tree hath some good juice, I gather from what they say of rue, which growing under a fig-tree is sweeter than usual, and hath a sweeter and more palatable juice, as if it drew some sweet particles from the tree which mollified its offensive and corroding qualities unless perhaps, on the contrary, the fig-tree robbing it of its nourishment draws likewise some of its sharpness and bitterness away.
πάλιν ὅταν σεισμὸς γένηται, φαντάζομαι ὅτι ἡ πόλις ἐπιπίπτειν μοι μέλλει·	Again, in an earthquake I imagine the city is going to fall upon me
καὶ ὁ μὲν αὐτίκα τελευτᾷ, τοῖς δ' Ἰδουμαίοις ἤδη κατορρωδοῦσι τὴν ἰσχὺν τοῦ Σίμωνος ἔδοξε πρὸ τοῦ συμβαλεῖν κατασκέψασθαι τὴν στρατιὰν τῶν πολεμίων.	He died on the spot, but the Idumaeans, already fearful of Simon's power, thought it wiser to survey the enemy's army before risking a battle with them.
“ὁ δὲ τρόπος τῆς ἀτοπίας ἐξ ἀνδρὸς ᾧ κἀγὼ κομιδῆ νέος ὢν ἔτι ἐντετύχηκα, σφόδρα εὐδοκιμήσαντος καὶ ἔτι δι’ ὧν καταλέλοιπεν συγγραμμάτων εὐδοκιμοῦντος, παρειλήφθω, Ὠριγένους, οὗ κλέος παρὰ τοῖς παρειλήφθω, τούτων τῶν λόγων μέγα διαδέδοται.	“But this kind οf absurdity must be traced to a man whom I met when I was still quite young, who had a great reputation, and still holds it, because of the writings he has left behind him, I mean Oregen, whose fame has been widespread among the teachers of this kind of learning.
ὁ μέντοι πρῶτος ἐπινοήσας δῆλον ὅτι πρὸς τὰ ἔσω ὠλισθηκότα, ἀσκῷ ἐμβάλλειν ἐπειρήσατο.	it is clear, however, that he who first invented this method intended it for dislocation inward.
γίνονται καὶ τούτοισιν, ὥσπερ πρόσθεν εἴρηται· τοῖσι μὲν γὰρ μετέωρον ἔχουσι τὸ σκέλος καὶ μηδὲν ταλαιπωρέουσιν, τούτοισι καὶ μάλιστα μινύθουσιν· οἳ δ’ ἂν πλεῖστα χρέωνται τῇ ἐπιβάσει, τούτοισιν ἥκιστα μινύθουσιν.	The wasting of the fleshy parts is analogous to what happens in the cases formerly described, for the wasting is greatest in those cases in which the patients keep the limb up, and do not exercise it, whilst those who practice walking, have the least atrophy.
αὐτὰρ ὁ βωμὸς αὐτὸς Δελφίνιος καὶ ἐπόψιος ἔσσεται αἰεί.	also the altar itself shall be called Delphinius and overlooking for ever.
ὡς μὲν τοίνυν γέγονέ μοι τὸ συμβόλαιον πρὸς Φορμίων’ Ἀθήνησιν, οὐδ’ αὐτοὶ ἔξαρνοί εἰσιν, παραγράφονται δὲ ὡς οὐκ εἰσαγώγιμον τὴν δίκην οὖσαν.	That the contract has been entered into between Phormio and myself at Athens even our opponents themselves do not deny, but they enter a special plea alleging that the action is not admissible.
ἢν δὲ καὶ παλαιοτέρου ἐόντος τοῦ νουσήματος, ἢ τριταίου ἢ τεταρταίου, τὸ πρόσωπον τοιοῦτον ᾖ, περὶ τουτέων ἐπανε ρέσθαι, περὶ ὧν καὶ πρότερον ἐκέλευσα, καὶ τἄλλα σημεῖα σκέπτεσθαι, τά τε ἐν τῷ ξύμπαντι προσώπῳ, τά τε ἐν τῷ σώματι, καὶ τὰ ἐν τοῖσιν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν.	And, also, if the disease be in a more advanced stage either on the third or fourth day, and the countenance be such, the same inquiries as formerly directed are to be made, and the other symptoms are to be noted, those in the whole countenance, those on the body, and those in the eyes
γυνὴ δὲ γονή μοι φαίνεται βούλεσθαι εἶναι. τὸ δὲ θῆλυ ἀπὸ τῆς θηλῆς τι φαίνεται ἐπωνομάσθαι·	The word γυνή (woman) seems to me to be much the same as γονή (birth). I think θῆλυ (female) is derived from θηλή (teat)
ἐπὶ δὲ ταῖς Ἀμαζόσιν Ἕλληνές εἰσιν ᾑρηκότες Ἴλιον καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς ἠθροισμένοι διὰ τὸ Αἴαντος ἐς Κασσάνδραν τόλμημα·	After the Amazons come the Greeks when they have taken Troy, and the kings assembled on account of the outrage committed by Ajax against Cassandra.
οὔ· ἀλλὰ πάροδός ἐστι καὶ ἕως τὸ πλοῖον μισθούμεθα, δυνάμεθα καὶ Ἐπίκτητον ἰδεῖν·	No, but It lies in our way, and while we are about hiring a ship, we may call on Epictetus.
ἢ διὰ τί ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς αὐτὸν εἰσήγαγε, τοῦ νόμου κελεύοντος ἅπαντας τοὺς γνησίους ἰσομοίρους εἶναι τῶν πατρῴων;	And why did he introduce them on special terms, when the law ordains that all the legitimate sons have an equal right to share in their father's property?
ἄνδρες δίκαιοι ἔστωσαν σύνδειπνοί σου, καὶ ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου ἔστω τὸ καύχημά σου.	Let righteous men be your table companions, and let your boast be in the fear of the Lord.
ὦ πρὸς μὲν τὰ μεγάλα καὶ σπουδαῖα τῶν ἔργων τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἁπάντων ἀχρηστότατε, πρὸς δὲ τὴν ἐν τοῖς λόγοις τόλμαν θαυμασιώτατε, ἐπιχειρήσεις αὐτίκα μάλα, βλέπων εἰς τὰ τούτων πρόσωπα, λέγειν ὡς δεῖ σε ἐπὶ ταῖς τῆς πόλεως συμφοραῖς στεφανοῦσθαι;	O man of all mankind most useless for great and serious deeds, but for boldness of words most wonderful, will you presently undertake to look this jury in the face and say that over the disasters of the city you must be crowned?
τοῖς δὲ τειχίσασι τὸν μισθὸν οὐκ ἀπεδίδου.	But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages.
οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀτάραχος.	Only so far as he is emancipated from perturbation.
διὰ τί, δυεῖν βωμῶν Ἡρακλέους ὄντων, οὐ μεταλαμβάνουσι γυναῖκες οὐδὲ γεύονται τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ μείζονος θυομένων;	Question 60. What is the reason that, of Hercules’s two altars, the women do not partake or taste of the things offered on the greater?
γεγραμμένους οὖν αὐτοὺς ἀμφοτέρους ἐν τῇ στήλῃ ὀφείλοντας τὰ σκεύη τῇ πόλει ἡ ἀρχὴ παραλαβοῦσα παρὰ τῆς προτέρας ἀρχῆς, ἡμῖν παρέδωκεν κατά τε τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰ ψηφίσματα.	Both their names, then, had been inscribed on the stelê as indebted to the state for the ship’s equipment, and the magistrates, receiving their names from those in office before them, gave them over to us in accordance with the law and the decrees.
καὶ γὰρ πλεῖστον διαφέρει ἡ τέλειος διαφορά τῶν τε γὰρ γένει διαφερόντων οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξωτέρω λαβεῖν καὶ τῶν εἴδει·	complete difference is the maximum difference since (a) we can find nothing beyond it, whether things differ in genus or in species (for we have shown that difference in relation to things outside the genus is impossible this is the maximum difference between them)
ἐπέδωκαν δὲ καὶ οἱ τὸ ἥμισυ χλωρόν, τὸ δὲ ἥμισυ ξηρὸν ἔχοντες:	And those also gave them up who had had them half green and half dry.
ἅτε δὲ τοῦ Ἡρακλέους ὄντος οὐκ ἀγνώστου τοῦ τε ἄθλου χάριν καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ σχήματι, τὸ ὄνομα οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ γεγραμμένον.	Heracles can be easily recognized by his exploit and his attitude, so his name is not inscribed by him.
ὅμως δὲ εἰρήσθω μοι ἀδικώτερον εἶναι τὸν ἑκόντα ψευδόμενον τοῦ ἄκοντος.	Still I venture to say that the intentional deception is more unjust than the unintentional.
ἐστὶ δὲ ἱκανῶς ἐπίμηκες ποτήριον τὸ καρχήσιον, καὶ τάχα διὰ τὸ ἀνατετάσθαι οὕτως ὠνόμασται.	And indeed, the carchesium is a tolerably oblong cup, and perhaps it has its name from its being stretched upwards.
οὐ μὴν μικρόν γε ἔοικεν ἡ ἐμπειρία συμβάλλεσθαι·	Not that experience does not seem to contribute considerably to political success
οὐκοῦν ἐπίστασαι μὲν ὅτι οἱ νῦν σοι ὑπήκοοι γενόμενοι οὐ φιλίᾳ τῇ σῇ ἐπείσθησαν ὑπὸ σοῦ ἄρχεσθαι ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκῃ, καὶ ὅτι ἐπιχειροῖεν ἂν πάλιν ἐλεύθεροι γίγνεσθαι, εἰ μή τις αὐτοὺς φόβος κατέχοι.	You understand, then, that those who have now become your subjects were not persuaded to live under your rule out of affection for you, but by stress of necessity, and that unless some fear should restrain them, they would endeavour to become free again.
εἰ δὲ ἡδὺ τὸ παρ’ ἑκόντων διαπράττεσθαι ὧν τις δέοιτο, εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι καὶ νυνὶ θᾶττον ἂν ἐγὼ καὶ σιωπῶν πείσαιμι τὸν παῖδα τόνδε καὶ τὴν παῖδα φιλῆσαί με ἢ σύ, ὦ Σώκρατες, εἰ καὶ πάνυ πολλὰ καὶ σοφὰ λέγοις.	Furthermore, if it is pleasurable to attain one’s desires with the good will of the giver, I know very well that at this very moment, without uttering a word, I could persuade this boy or this girl to give me a kiss sooner than you could, Socrates, no matter how long and profoundly you might argue.
καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἀνδρειότατοι δοκοῦσιν εἶναι παρ’ οἷς οἱ δειλοὶ ἄτιμοι καὶ οἱ ἀνδρεῖοι ἔντιμοι.	hence those races appear to be the bravest among which cowards are degraded and brave men held in honor.
καὶ γὰρ αὐτίκα γένοιτ’ ἂν Ἀντώνιον δείπνου δεηθῆναι καὶ μετὰ μικρόν, ἂν δὲ οὕτω τύχῃ, παραγαγεῖν αἰτήσαντα ποτήριον ἢ λόγου τινὸς ἐμπεσόντος.	For it might happen that Antony would ask for supper immediately, and after a little while, perhaps, would postpone it and call for a cup of wine, or engage in conversation with some one.
μετὰ δὲ Λαοδίκειαν ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον ὥρμα, πυνθανόμενος μὲν Κλεοπάτραν βαρεῖ στόλῳ διαπλευσεῖσθαι πρός τε Καίσαρα καὶ πρὸς Ἀντώνιον, ἐπινοῶν δὲ κωλῦσαί τε τὸν πλοῦν καὶ τίσασθαι τῆς γνώμης τὴν βασιλίδα καὶ πρὸ τῶνδε αὐτὴν Αἴγυπτον ἐνθυμιζόμενος μάλιστα ἐν καιρῷ, τετρυμένην τε ὑπὸ λιμοῦ καὶ ξενικὸν στρατὸν οὐ πολὺν ἔχουσαν, ἄρτι τῶν Ἀλλιηνοῦ στρατιωτῶν ἀποστάντων.	After the capture of Laodicea Cassius turned his attention to Egypt. Having learned that Cleopatra was about to join Octavius and Antony with a strong fleet, he purposed to prevent its sailing and to punish the queen for her intention. He had before this thought that the condition of Egypt was especially favorable for these designs, because it was wasted by famine and had no considerable foreign army, now that the forces of Allienus had taken their departure.
Παρυπήντησεν δ’ αὐτῷ παρὰ δόξαν ἐρημία πολλὴ πάντων ἐκτρεπομένων καὶ μηδενὸς προσιέναι τολμῶντος·	And here he found a perfect and unexpected solitude, while ever body avoided him, and nobody durst come at him
εἰ γὰρ συνέθεσθε τὴν νῦν ὑπάρχουσαν ὑμῖν πρὸς ἡμᾶς συμμαχίαν πρότερον τῶν ὑπ’ Ἀντιγόνου γεγονότων εἰς ὑμᾶς εὐεργετημάτων, ἴσως ἦν εἰκὸς διαπορεῖν, εἰ δέον ἐστί, τοῖς ἐπιγεγονόσιν εἴκοντας παριδεῖν τι τῶν πρότερον ὑπαρχόντων.	For if you had made the alliance now existing between yourselves and us, previous to the good services done you by Antigonus, there might perhaps have been some reason for questioning whether it were right to neglect an old treaty in gratitude for recent favours.
οἵ τε Πομπηιανοὶ πυθόμενοι θαυμαστοὶ ὅσοι διεφάνησαν, ἐκβοῶντες ἄρτι τὴν πάτριον ἐλευθερίαν ἀπειληφέναι, καὶ θυσίαι καθ’ ἕνα ἦσαν καὶ χειροτονίαι δέκα ἀνδρῶν ἐς εὔθυναν τῆς ἀρχῆς τῆς Ἀντωνίου.	When the Pompeians learned what had happened (and an astonishing number showed themselves to be of that party), they exclaimed that their ancestral freedom had at last been regained, and they each offered sacrifices.
οὐδὲν δὲ πρὸς ἐχυρὰν πόλιν ἐξ ἐφόδου δυνάμενος, οὐδὲ μηχανήμασιν ἔχων χρῆσθαι διὰ τὸ ὕψος, ᾕρει τὰς ἄλλας ἐπιθέων, ἐρημοτέρας ἀνδρῶν ὑπὸ τῆς ἐς τὸ Δελμίνιον συνόδου γενομένας.	As he was not able to attack this strongly defended town from the road, nor to use the engines that he had, on account of the height of the place, he attacked and captured some other towns that were partially deserted on account of the concentration of forces at Delminium.
ἄκουε οὖν, φησί, καθὼς βούλει, ἵνα νοήσῃς αὐτά.	Listen, then, said he, that you may understand it as you wish.
Σωκράτης. ἄρτι δὲ ἥκεις ἢ πάλαι;	Soc. And are you only just come?
τὰ μὲν οὖν πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἧττόν ἐστιν ὑγιεινά, τὰ δὲ ἄλλα εὐάγωγά τε καὶ παραπλησίως ἐξησκημένα.	these latter are unhealthy, but the others are salubrious and well cultivated.
τὸ δὲ ἔργα μὲν ἔχειν καὶ κολάσεις, τροφὴν δὲ μή, βίαιον καὶ ἀδυναμίαν ποιεῖ.	If they are made to work, and are chastised, but stinted of their food, such treatment is oppressive, and saps their strength.
αὐτὸς μέντοι κατῃσχύνθην πάντα τὰ τοιουτότροπα ἰητρεύειν οὕτω, διὰ τοῦτο ὅτι πρὸς ἀπατεώνων μᾶλλον οἱ τοιοῦτοι τρόποι.	But, indeed, for my own part, I have been ashamed to treat all such cases in this way, because such modes of procedure are generally practiced by charlatans.
ἢ τίνα τρόπον διεξῆλθον μὲν τὴν ἔρημον, ἐκράτησαν δὲ τῆς χώρας ἧς νῦν κατοικοῦμεν, ἔκτισαν δὲ καὶ πόλιν καὶ νεὼν ᾠκοδομήσαντο πᾶσι περιβόητον;	Or after what manner did they pass over the desert, and get the land which we now dwell in, and build our city, and that temple which hath been so famous among all mankind?
ὅτι μὲν γὰρ τῆς νυκτὸς νέμονται, κύνας νυκτερευτικὰς πορισάμενοι, ταύταις αὐτοὺς θηρῶσιν·	Since hares feed by night, hounds specially adapted for night work are provided to hunt them
ἔστι δ’ Ἀπάμεια καὶ Ἡράκλεια, πόλεις περὶ τὰς Ῥάγας.	Apameia and Heracleia are cities in the neighbourhood of Rhag.
κἂν ἔνθεν ἐκβληθῶσιν οἱ τύραννοι, τί ἔτι ἀποτειχίζω τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ἐμοῦ γε ἕνεκα;	And if tyrants have been ejected from us, why do I still shut in the acropolis by a wall of circumvallation, at least on my account
ἔτυχεν δὲ κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρὸν πάντας ἀναβαίνειν τοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων τῶν τῆς Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης πρώτους καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τὴν τῶν τελῶν ὠνήν·	Now it happened that at this time all the principal men and rulers went up out of the cities of Syria and Phoenicia, to bid for their taxes
συναθροιζόμενοί τε καὶ συνομνύμενοι κατὰ λόχους στρατιᾶς μὲν ὀλιγώτεροι πλείους δὲ λῃστηρίου προσέπιπτον ἱεροῖς καὶ πόλεσιν,	These who now gathered and joined in the conspiracy, too small to be an army and too many to be a gang of thieves, attacked temples and cities,
πολλάκις σοῦ ἐν διδασκάλων ἤκουον παιδὸς ὄντος καὶ ἄλλοθι, καὶ ὁπότε ἀστραγαλίζοις ἢ ἄλλην τινὰ παιδιὰν παίζοις, οὐχ ὡς ἀποροῦντος περὶ τῶν δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων, ἀλλὰ μάλα μέγα καὶ θαρραλέως λέγοντος περὶ ὅτου τύχοις τῶν παίδων ὡς πονηρός τε καὶ ἄδικος εἴη καὶ ὡς ἀδικοῖ·	Many a time I heard you, when as a child you were dicing or playing some other game at your teacher’s or elsewhere, instead of showing hesitation about what was just and unjust, speak in very loud and confident tones about one or other of your playmates, saying he was a rascal and a cheat who played unfairly.
τοὺς δὲ περὶ Εὔμαιον ἐλευθερώσας ὁ Τηλέμαχος κατέμειξεν εἰς τοὺς πολίτας, καὶ τὸ γένος ἐστὶ Κολιαδῶν ἀπ’ Εὐμαίου καὶ Βουκολιδῶν ἀπὸ Φιλοιτίου.	And Telemachus, setting Eumaeus and his people at liberty, placed them among the citizens and the family of the Coliads is descended from Eumaeus, and that of the Bucolians from Philoetius.
Α. οἶνοι δέ σοι, λευκός, γλυκύς, αὐθιγενής, ἡδύς, καπνίας.	And to wash all these dainties down There's wine, both native and imported, White and red, and sweet and acid, Still or effervescent.
γενομένου δὲ τοῦ καπνοῦ συμβαλὼν τοῖς ἐκ μετώπου καὶ μαχόμενος ὥραις τρισὶ καρτερῶς εἷλε τὴν πόλιν.	When the smoke was seen he made an attack in front and, after a severe fight of three hours, took the city.
Οἱ δὲ διώξαντες τὸν Κέστιον ὡς ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, τοὺς μὲν βίᾳ τῶν ἔτι ῥωμαιζόντων τοὺς δὲ πειθοῖ προσήγοντο, καὶ συναθροισθέντες εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν στρατηγοὺς ἀπεδείκνυσαν τοῦ πολέμου πλείονας.	On their return to Jerusalem those who had followed Cestius prevailed over those who favoured the Romans, some they forced, and some they won by persuasion. They gathered in great numbers in the temple and appointed many generals for the war.
αἵματι κεκραμένους ποταμοὺς ἔπιε καὶ νεκροῖς γεγεφυρωμένους διέβη, καὶ πόαν ἔφαγε διὰ λιμὸν ἣν πρώτην εἶδε, καὶ βάθεσι χιόνων κατακεχωσμένα ἔθνη καὶ πόλεις ὑπὸ γῆν ἐνδεδυκυίας διώρυξε, καὶ θάλατταν μαχομένην ἔπλευσε, καὶ θῖνας ἀνύδρους τὰς Γεδρωσίων καὶ Ἀραχωσίων ὁδεύων ἐν θαλάσσῃ πρότερον ἢ ἐν γῇ φυτὸν εἶδεν.	He drank rivers fouled with blood, crossed streams bridged by dead bodies, through hunger ate the first grass that he saw, dug through nations buried in deep snow and cities built beneath the earth, sailed over a battling sea and as he traversed the parching strands of Gedrosia and Arachosia, it was in the sea, not on the land, that first he saw a living plant.
τοῦτο γὰρ εἶναι παρὰ τὴν ἔννοιαν αὐτοὶ δὲ τῶν κακῶν ἀρχὴν ἀγαθὸν ὄντα τὸν θεὸν ποιοῦσιν.	for that this is against sense. And yet they make God, who is good, the beginning of evils.
τὰ δὲ σπήλαια ταῦτα πρὸς ἀποκρήμνοις ὄρεσιν ἦν οὐδαμόθεν προσιτά, πλαγίας δὲ ἀνόδους μόνον ἔχοντα στενοτάτας. ἡ δὲ κατὰ μέτωπον αὐτῶν πέτρα κατέτεινεν εἰς βαθυτάτας φάραγγας ὄρθιος ἐπιρρέπουσα ταῖς χαράδραις, ὥστε τὸν βασιλέα μέχρι πολλοῦ μὲν ἀπορεῖν πρὸς τὸ ἀμήχανον τοῦ τόπου, τελευταῖον δ' ἐπινοίαι χρήσασθαι σφαλερωτάτῃ.	These caves were in the precipices of craggy mountains and could not be got at from any side, since they had only some winding and very narrow pathways leading up to them, and the rock in front of them reared above valleys of huge depth and almost perpendicular slope. For a long time the king pondered what to do, because of the near impossibility of attacking the place, and finally came up with a hazardous plan.
μαρτυρεῖ δὲ αὐτὸ τὸ συμβεβηκός·	The actual course of events bears witness to this
καὶ ποιεῦντες ταῦτα αὐτοὶ μὲν φασὶ ἐπὶ δεξιὰ ποιέειν, Ἕλληνας δὲ ἐπ᾽ἀριστερά.	and doing these things they say that they do it on the right, but that the Greeks do it on the left.
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἔσεσθαι βαρὺς μισθόν τε τῆς φιλοξενίας τελέσας καὶ δαπάναις ἰδίαις χρησάμενος.	for he would not be burdensome, but would pay the hire for his entertainment, and spend his own money.
καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποίησον· ἀπόστησον τοὺς βασιλεῖς ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν καὶ θοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτῶν σατράπας,	Do this matter: Remove the kings each in their place and put governors in place of them.
Ἀριστοφῶντος δὲ Νεμέαν γράψαντος ἐν ταῖς ἀγκάλαις αὑτῆς καθήμενον Ἀλκιβιάδην ἔχουσαν, ἐθεῶντο καὶ συνέτρεχον χαίροντες.	Aristophon painted Nemea with Alcibiades seated in her arms whereat the people were delighted, and ran in crowds to see the picture.
ἐλθὼν δὲ τἄξω πρᾶσσε, τἀν δόμοις δ’ ἐγώ, οἴμοι·	Go, manage matters out of doors but in the house it is my place to decide .
Ἰδοὺ δὴ ἐν τῷ φόβῳ ὑμῶν οὗτοι φοβηθήσονται· οὓς ἐφοβεῖσθε, βοήσονται ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν· ἄγγελοι ἀποσταλήσονται πικρῶς κλαίοντες, παρακαλοῦντες εἰρήνην.	Look, now! These people will be frightened with fear of you; those whom you feared will cry out because of you. Messengers will be sent bitterly weeping, begging for peace,
ἥ τε χώρη τῆς χώρης ἡμερωτέρη, καὶ τὰ ἤθεα τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἠπιώτερακαὶ εὐοργητότερα.	the one region is less wild than the other, the character of the inhabitants is milder and more gentle.
ὁ δ’ ἄσμενος ἀκούσας τοῦ λόγου, καὶ μέγα, ὥσπερ ἦν, ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ἡγούμενος Καρχηδόνα προσλαβεῖν, αὐτίκα αὐτὸν ἐπιστέλλειν τοῖς φίλοις ἐκέλευεν.	Antiochus listened eagerly to this advice, and as he considered a Carthaginian accession a great advantage (as it would have been) for his war, directed him to write to his friends at once.
αἴτιος δὲ τοῦ μὲν αὐτὸς ὁ Γάλβας αἰδούμενος τὸν ἄνδρα, τοῦ δὲ οἱ φίλοι καὶ μάλιστα Οὐίνιος Τίτος, ὑπὸ φθόνου τὸν Οὐεργίνιον οἰόμενος μὲν κολούειν, ἠγνόει δὲ ἄρα τῷ Οὐεργινίου χρηστῷ δαίμονι συνεργῶν, ἤδη τὸν ἄνδρα πολέμων καὶ κακῶν, ὅσα τοὺς ἄλλους ἡγεμόνας κατέσχεν, ἐκτὸς εἰς βίον ἀκύμονα καὶ γῆρας εἰρήνης καὶ ἡσυχίας μεστὸν ὑπεκτιθεμένῳ.	This was due, in the one case, to Galba himself, who had a wholesome respect for Verginius, and in the other to Galba’s friends, especially Titus Vinius. Vinius was jealous of Verginius, and thought to block his career but without knowing it he was aiding the man’s good genius, which was now removing him from all the wars and miseries which encompassed the other leaders, and bringing him into a calm haven of life, and an old age full of peace and quiet.
μετ’ οὐ πολὺ γὰρ Ἀντίοχος Κενδεβαῖον τὸν αὐτοῦ στρατηγὸν μετὰ δυνάμεως δῃώσοντα τὴν Ἰουδαίαν ἔπεμψεν καὶ καταδουλωσόμενον Σίμωνα.	for it was not long ere Antiochus sent Cendebeus his general with an army to lay waste Judea, and to subdue Simon
καὶ κελεύσας ἀπαχθῆναι τὴν ἐπὶ θανάτῳ τῶν ἀπολεσάντων στρατιωτῶν ἕνα, φόβῳ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐτήρησε τοὺς ἵππους·	so he commanded that one of those soldiers who had lost their horses should be capitally punished whereby he so terrified the rest, that they preserved their horses for the time to come
τούτους περιτέμνεσθαι τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀναγκαζόντων, εἰ θέλουσιν εἶναι παρ’ αὐτοῖς, οὐκ εἴασα βιασθῆναι, φάσκων δεῖν ἕκαστον κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ προαίρεσιν τὸν θεὸν εὐσεβεῖν, ἀλλὰ μὴ μετὰ βίας, χρῆναι δὲ τούτους δι’ ἀσφάλειαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς καταφυγόντας μὴ μετανοεῖν.	and when the Jews would force them to be circumcised, if they would stay among them, I would not permit them to have any force put upon them, but said to them, "Every one ought to worship God according to his own inclinations, and not to be constrained by force and that these men, who had fled to us for protection, ought not to be so treated as to repent of their coming hither."
Εὐριπίδη δός μοι σπυρίδιον διακεκαυμένον λύχνῳ.	euripides, give me a little basket with a lamp alight inside.
Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀναστήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω τὰ πεπτωκότα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ κατεσκαμμένα αὐτῆς ἀναστήσω, καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω αὐτὴν καθὼς αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ αἰῶνος,	On that day I will raise up the tent of David that has fallen, and I will rebuild its things that have fallen, and I will raise up its things that have been destroyed, and I will rebuild it just as the days of the age,
Πολυκρατίδας πρεσβεύων πρὸς τοὺς βασιλέως στρατηγοὺς μεθ’ ἑτέρων, ἐρομένων αὐτῶν πότερον ἰδίᾳ πάρεισιν ἢ δημοσίᾳ ἐπέμφθησαν, αἴκα τύχωμεν, δημοσίᾳ, εἶπεν, αἰ δὲ μὴ, ἰδίᾳ.	Polycratidas being joined with others in an embassy to the lieutenants of the king, being asked whether they came as private or public persons, returned, If we obtain our demands, as public if not, as private.
βʹ Πλούτου μητέρ’ Ὀλυμπίαν ἀείδω Δήμητρα στεφανηφόροις ἐν ὥραις, σέ τε, παῖ Διός, Φερσεφόνη·	I sing at this glad season, of the Queen, Mother of Plutus, heavenly Ceres
οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου διατηροῦσιν αἴσθησιν, φαυλίζει δὲ λόγους παράνομος.	But the eyes of the Lord preserve perception, but the lawbreaker despises words.
σκοποῦντι δή μοι ταῦτά τε καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς πράττοντας τὰ πολιτικά, καὶ τοὺς νόμους γε καὶ ἔθη, ὅσῳ μᾶλλον διεσκόπουν ἡλικίας τε εἰς τὸ πρόσθε προύβαινον, τοσούτῳ χαλεπώτερον ἐφαίνετο ὀρθῶς εἶναί μοι τὰ πολιτικὰ διοικεῖν·	When, therefore, I considered all this, and the type of men who were administering the affairs of State, with their laws too and their customs, the more I considered them and the more I advanced in years myself, the more difficult appeared to me the task of managing affairs of State rightly.
Οὐδεὶς μέντοι παρρησίᾳ ἐλάλει περὶ αὐτοῦ διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων.	However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
ἔστι γὰρ ἐν τῇ Φλιασίων ἀκροπόλει κυπαρίσσων ἄλσος καὶ ἱερὸν ἁγιώτατον ἐκ παλαιοῦ·	On the Phliasian citadel is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy.
μέγα μέν, ὦ Κλεινία, φρονοῦσιν αἱ Ἀθῆναι, μέγα δὲ καὶ ἡ Σπάρτη, καὶ μακρὰν ἀποικοῦσιν ἑκάτεραι·	Athens is haughty, Clinias, and Sparta also is haughty, and both are far distant
καταλύσεως δὲ γενομένης, ἧς νῦν ὑμεῖς τὸ πλέον κύριοί ἐστε, τὴν χάριν ὑμῖν προσθήσουσιν.	but if an end be made, which is now for the most part in your own hands, the thanks will be yours.
διὰ τοῦτο Ζήνων μὲν Ἀντιγόνῳ μέλλων ἐντυγχάνειν οὐκ ἠγωνία· ἃ γὰρ οὗτος ἐθαύμαζεν, τούτων οὐδενὸς εἶχεν ἐκεῖνος ἐξουσίαν, ὧν δ’ εἶχεν ἐκεῖνος οὐκ ἐπεστρέφετο οὗτος·	For this reason when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus, he was not anxious, for Antigonus had no power over any of the things which Zeno admired and Zeno did not care for those things over which Antigonus had power.
Γάιος Φαβρίκιος τὴν ὑπὸ Πύρρου Ῥωμαίων ἧτταν πυθόμενος, Λαιβῖνον, εἶπε, Πύρρος, οὐκ Ἠπειρῶται Ῥωμαίους νενικήκασιν.	C. FABRICIUS. C. Fabricius, hearing Pyrrhus had overthrown the Romans, told Labienus, it was Pyrrhus, not the Epirots, that beat the Romans.
ὅσους οὖν ἂν ἴδῃς κακοδαιμονοῦντας, δυσροοῦντας, πενθοῦντας, ἀποφαίνου θαρρῶν μὴ εἶναι ἐλευθέρους.	As many, therefore, as you see unhappy, lamenting, unprosperous,—confidently pronounce them not free.
ἅμα δὲ μᾶλλον ὁ λιμὸς ἐπέτεινε, καὶ διαμαρτία τις γενομένη περὶ τὴν τοῦ Λύκου διάβασιν πλῆθος ἀνθρώπων ἁρπασθὲν ὑπὸ τοῦ ῥεύματος ἀπώλεσεν.	And not only did famine press them harder, but also some mistake was made in crossing the river Lycus, and a large number of men were carried away by the current and lost.
τὰ δὲ ἐντεῦθεν ἔρρεπε γὰρ ἤδη τὸ χρεὼν ἐς ἅλωσιν τῶν Μεσσηνίων προεσήμαινεν αὐτοῖς τὰ μέλλοντα ὁ θεός.	Next, as fate was already inclining towards the conquest of the Messenians, the god revealed to them the future.
ἀλλ’ οὐ διαφεύξονται τὸν μέγαν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ἀνίκητον δεξιάν, δώσουσιν δ’ ἡμῖν αὐτίκα δίκας, ἂν τοῦ πατρίου φρονήματος ἤδη σπάσαντες τιμωροὶ τῶν παρεσπονδημένων ἀναστῶμεν.	But they will not avoid his great eye, nor his invincible right hand and we shall be revenged of them presently, in case we still retain any of the courage of our forefathers, and rise up boldly to punish these covenant-breakers.
κοινούμενος δὲ τὴν νίκην τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἰδίᾳ μὲν τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις ἔπεμψε τῶν αἰχμαλώτων τριακοσίας ἀσπίδας, κοινῇ δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις λαφύροις ἐκέλευσεν ἐπιγράψαι φιλοτιμοτάτην ἐπιγραφήν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Φιλίππου καὶ οἱ Ἕλληνες πλὴν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων τῶν τὴν Ἀσίαν κατοικούντων ἐκπώματα δὲ καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα τῶν Περσικῶν ἔλαβε, πάντα τῇ μητρὶ πλὴν ὀλίγων ἔπεμψεν.	Moreover, desiring to make the Greeks partners in his victory, he sent to the Athenians in particular three hundred of the captured shields, and upon the rest of the spoils in general he ordered a most ambitious inscription to be wrought Alexander the son of Philip and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians from the Barbarians who dwell in Asia. But the drinking vessels and the purple robes and whatever things of this nature he took from the Persians, all these, except a few, he sent to his mother.
ἀλλὰ ναὶ μὰ Δί’, ἔφη ὁ Ἰσχόμαχος, τοιούτους ὅταν ἐπιτρόπους βούλωμαι καθιστάναι, καὶ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι διδάσκω.	Well, when I want to make bailiffs of such men, of course I teach them also to be careful.
οὗτοι δὲ συστραφέντες καὶ πυκνώσαντες ἑαυτοὺς καὶ διὰ μέσων ὠσάμενοι τῶν πολεμίων ἔφυγον ἐπὶ τὰ πλησίον ὄρη, καὶ κατασχόντες ἱδρύθησαν. οἱ δ' ἄλλοι πάντες περὶ δισμυρίους ὄντες καὶ πεντακισχιλίους ἀπέθανον.	These formed themselves into a close rank and forced their way through the enemy and fled to the neighbouring mountains, which they took and where they established themselves, while all the others, about twenty-five thousand of them, were killed.
τῆς δὲ Ἰταλίας Σιποῦντα μὲν τῆς Αὐσονίας οἱ τοῦ Ἀντωνίου κατέλαβον, Θουρίους δὲ καὶ Κωνσεντίαν Πομπήιος ἐπολιόρκει καὶ τὴν χώραν ἐπενέμετο τοῖς ἱππεῦσιν.	In Italy Antony's men captured the town of Sipuntum of Ausonia. Pompeius besieged Thurii and Consentia and ravaged their territory with his cavalry.
μόνον σύ μοι, δέσποινα ποντία Κύπρι, συνεργὸς εἴης.	only be thou, queen Cypris, ocean’s child, my partner in the work!
ἀλλ’ ἤδη δι’ ὧν μὲν μᾶλλον, δι’ ὧν δὲ ἧττον.	Only there is a difference of degree in some parts there is more of it, in others less.
ἢν δὲ καὶ μὴ καθίστηται τὸ ἕλκος, μίμνῃ δὲ ἐς πολλὸν χρόνον, ἀπόσιτοι, καχέκται, οἰδαλέοι, ἰδεῖν ἀπρεπέες, πολυελκέες πάντη· μάλιστα δὲ ἐς κνήμας· στρογγύλα, πελιδνὰ , κοῖλα, Ῥυπαρὰ, δυσαλθέα τὰ ἕλκεα·	And if the ulcer does not heal, but remains for a long time, they lose appetite, become cachectic, swollen, unseemly to look at, having many ulcers on all parts of the body, especially on the legs, where the sores are round, livid, hollow, foul, and difficult to heal.
οἶμαι γὰρ ἔγωγε οὐδένα οὕτως ἀγαθὸν εἶναι λογίζεσθαι, ὅστις ἐξευρήσει τοὔνομα αὐτοῦ.	Personally, I do not believe that there is anyone ingenious enough to find the right name for him.
καὶ τίνες παραβατικώτερον αὐτῆς ἔχουσιν ὑμῶν τῶν ταῦτα διειληφότων;	And who violate it more than you, who teach such doctrines?
καὶ ἐλθὼν σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν εἶπα Κύριε ὁ θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου Ἀβραάμ, εἰ σὺ εὐοδοῖς τὴν ὁδόν μου, ἣν νῦν ἐγὼ πορεύομαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν·	And, coming today to the spring, I said, ‘Lord, the God of my lord Abraham, if you make my journey prosperous, which now I am going upon it,
ὡραῖος γὰρ ὢν προσάγει με λέγειν ἀεὶ περὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ κάλλους ὁποῖόν ἐστιν, μὴ δυνάμενον μηδὲ χωροῦντα κατ’ ἀξίαν εἰπεῖν·	for he being beautiful draweth me on always to speak concerning his beauty, what it is, though I be not able and suffice not to speak it worthily
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἔφραζε διὰ τῶν γραμμάτων ὅτι πεντακισχίλιαι μὲν μυριάδες ἐκ τῶν τελῶν ὑπῆρχον, ἐκ δὲ ὧν αὐτὸς προσεκτήσατο τῇ πόλει μυριάδας ὀκτακισχιλίας πεντακοσίας λαμβάνουσιν, ἀναφέρεται δὲ εἰς τὸ δημόσιον ταμιεῖον ἐν νομίσματι καὶ κατασκευαῖς ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου δισμύρια τάλαντα, πάρεξ τῶν εἰς τοὺς στρατιώτας δεδομένων, ὧν ὁ τοὐλάχιστον αἴρων κατὰ λόγον δραχμὰς εἴληφε χιλίας πεντακοσίας.	In addition to all this the inscriptions set forth that whereas the public revenues from taxes had been fifty million drachmas, they were receiving from the additions which Pompey had made to the city’s power eighty-five million, and that he was bringing into the public treasury in coined money and vessels of gold and silver twenty thousand talents, apart from the money which had been given to his soldiers, of whom the one whose share was the smallest had received fifteen hundred drachmas.
τίνα δὲ φθέγγεσθαι μέγιστον ἁπάντων καὶ σαφέστατ’ ἂν εἰπεῖν ὅ τι βούλοιτο τῇ φωνῇ;	Who is the most vehement speaker, the man who can express himself most emphatically with the aid of his big voice?
ἢ τί μέγα νόσοις νόσους σωματικὰς ἀπαλλάττεσθαι;	or what great thing is it to rid men of diseases of the body?
ποῖον Εὐθυκράτη, ποῖον Λασθένη, τίν’ οὐχ ὑπερβαλεῖσθαι προδότην;	Will they not outvie Euthycrates, Lasthenes, and all the traitors of history?
καὶ Ἰωναθὰν καὶ Ἀχειμὰς εἱστήκεισαν ἐν τῇ πηγῇ Ῥωγήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ παιδίσκη καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς· καὶ αὐτοὶ πορεύονται καὶ ἀναγγέλλουσιν τῷ βασιλεῖ Δαυείδ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐδύναντο ὀφθῆναι τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν πόλιν.	And Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been standing at the spring of En-rogel and the servant girl went and reported to them and they went and reported to King David that they could not be seen coming into the city.
διόπερ ἐγώ σοι πειράσομαι συντόμως ὑποθέσθαι, δι’ ὧν ἄν μοι δοκεῖς ἐπιτηδευμάτων πλεῖστον πρὸς ἀρετὴν ἐπιδοῦναι καὶ παρὰ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκιμῆσαι.	Wherefore I shall endeavor to set before you concisely by what practices I think you can make the most progress toward virtue and win the highest repute in the eyes of all other men.
ἔστι γὰρ δὴ ἀνδρὸς ἔργον Αἰγινήτου Σμίλιδος τοῦ Εὐκλείδου.	for it is the work of an Aeginetan, Smilis, the son of Eucleides.
εἰς δὲ συστάσεις κύκλους τ’ ἐχώρει λαὸς οἰκήτωρ θεοῦ. Ἀγαμέμνονος δὲ παῖς διαστείχων πόλιν ἐς οὖς ἑκάστῳ δυσμενεῖς ηὔδα λόγους·	for the folk, who dwell near the god’s shrine, began to collect in groups, while Agamemnon’s son, going to and fro through the town, would whisper in each man’s ear malignant hints
ἐμπάσσειν ὧδε τῆς μυροβαλάνου σεσησμένης , ἐπιπλάσμασί τε τοῖσι μαλθακωτάτοισι.	add to them, in powder, nut-ben sifted and to the most emollient cataplasms * * * * * * * * * * * *
Προῖτος δὲ εὐλαβηθεὶς μὴ βραδυνούσης τῆς θεραπείας αἰτηθείη καὶ πλεῖον, θεραπεύειν συνεχώρησεν ἐπὶ τούτοις.	Fearing that, if the cure were delayed, yet more would be demanded of him, Proetus agreed to let the physician proceed on these terms.
καὶ πέμψας εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα πρεσβευτὴν ᾐτιᾶτο τὸν Ὀνίαν ὡς οὐκ ἀποδιδόντα τοὺς φόρους καὶ ἠπείλει κληρουχήσειν αὐτῶν τὴν γῆν οὐκ ἀπολαβὼν καὶ πέμψειν τοὺς ἐνοικήσοντας στρατιώτας.	He sent an envoy to Jerusalem complaining that Onias did not pay his taxes and threatening, if he did not receive them, to seize their land and send soldiers to occupy it.
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἀποδήμους εἶναι δεῖ τῶν ἀγαθῶν τῶν ἡμετέρων τοὺς ἐμοὶ φιλτάτους ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῦ λιμοῦ λοιπὴν ἔτι πενταετίαν περιμενοῦντος.	for it is not proper that the persons dearest to me should live remote from me, now my affairs are so prosperous, especially when they must endure five more years of famine."
οὐ χλιδῶσα γὰρ οὐδὲ θρυπτομένη διὰ τὸ κάλλος εἰσάγεται, εὑρίσκεται γοῦν περὶ ἱστὸν ὑφαίνουσα καὶ ποικίλλουσα· τὴν δ’ εὗρ’ ἐν μεγάρῳ·	For she is never represented as luxurious or arrogant, because of her beauty. Accordingly, she is found at her loom weaving and embroidering— Her in the palace at the loom she found, The golden web her own sad story crown'd
ὀθονίῳ δὲ ἢ ταινίῃ μαλθακῇ κατακεκολλήσθω ἄκρον τὸ ξύλον, ὅκως προσηνέστερον ἔῃ.	and a piece of soft shawl or cloth should be glued to the end of the piece of wood, so as to give the less pain upon pressure.
κἄπειτα θάλαμον ἐσπεσοῦσα καὶ λέχος, ἐνταῦθα δὴ ’δάκρυσε καὶ λέγει τάδε· Ὦ λέκτρον, ἔνθα παρθένει’ ἔλυσ’ ἐγὼ κορεύματ’ ἐκ τοῦδ’ ἀνδρός, οὗ θνῄσκω πέρι, χαῖρ’·	Anon into her bridal bower she burst, and then her tears brake forth and thus she cried, O couch, whereon I loosed my maiden state for the man in whose cause I die, farewell!
βραχεῖ δ’ ἀνώτερον χρόνῳ γεγευμένοι τοῦ φόνου τοῦ κατ’ ἀλλήλων ἐν ταῖς κατὰ τὴν Ἀρσινοΐαν σφαγαῖς ἕτοιμοι πρὸς πᾶν ἦσαν, ἀποτεθηριωμένοι τὰς ψυχάς, ὥστε μηδὲ βουλὴν διδόναι τοῖς προεστῶσι.	and a little earlier still they had had a taste of mutual slaughter in the massacres at Arsinoe they were, therefore, ready for anything, and their minds were so infuriated that they would not allow their magistrates to have even a voice in their business.
καὶ βασιλεῖς δὲ καὶ δυνάσται καὶ δεκαρχίαι τῆς ἐκείνου μερίδος καὶ εἰσὶ καὶ ὑπῆρξαν ἀεί.	and in his (peculiar) portion (of the empire) there are and ever have been kings, princes, and (municipal) magistrates.
ὦ κοινὸν ὠφέλημα θνητοῖσιν φανείς, τλῆμον Προμηθεῦ, τοῦ δίκην πάσχεις τάδε;	O you who have shown yourself a common benefactor of mankind, wretched Prometheus, why do you suffer so?
ἐμισεῖτο δὲ διδοὺς πλεῖον, ὡς ἂν οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ μεγαλοψύχου χαριζόμενος ἀλλ’ ἀναλίσκων κατὰ δέος.	yet the more he gave, the more he was hated, as not making these presents out of generosity, but spending his money out of fear.
ἐὰν ἀκούσωσιν καὶ δουλεύσωσιν, συντελέσουσιν τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτῶν ἐν ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ τὰ ἔτη αὐτῶν ἐν εὐπρεπείαις.	If they listen and serve him, they shall complete their days in blessing and their years in dignity.
ὅπως τε Ἰουδαίοις ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ τῆς μισθώσεως [ἔτει] τῆς προσόδου κόρον ὑπεξέλωνται καὶ μήτε ἐργολαβῶσί τινες μήτε φόρους τοὺς αὐτοὺς τελῶσιν.	and that the Jews be exempted a corus from their tax every second year the land is rented, and that their tax not be farmed out or they always be liable to the same tax."
καὶ ἔτι γε τούτων ἐναργέστερα, τὰ δέκα μοι ἐδόκει τῶν ὀκτὼ πλέονα εἶναι διὰ τὸ δύο αὐτοῖς προσεῖναι, καὶ τὸ δίπηχυ τοῦ πηχυαίου μεῖζον εἶναι διὰ τὸ ἡμίσει αὐτοῦ ὑπερέχειν. νῦν δὲ δή, ἔφη ὁ Κέβης, τί σοι δοκεῖ περὶ αὐτῶν;	and, to mention still clearer things than those, I thought ten were more than eight because two had been added to the eight, and I thought a two-cubit rule was longer than a one-cubit rule because it exceeded it by half its length.And now, said Cebes, what do you think about them?
τῶν δὲ σίλλων τρία ἐστίν, ἐν οἷς ὡς ἂν σκεπτικὸς ὢν πάντας λοιδορεῖ καὶ σιλλαίνει τοὺς δογματικοὺς ἐν παρῳδίας εἴδει.	There are three silli in which, from his point of view as a Sceptic, he abuses every one and lampoons the dogmatic philosophers, using the form of parody.
ἐπαινουμένων ἐπὶ τῇ ἰδέᾳ ταύτῃ τῆς ποιητικῆς Ἀλκαίου τε καὶ Ἀνακρέοντος, ὡς Ἀριστοφάνης παρίστησιν ἐν Δαιταλεῦσιν λέγων οὕτως ᾆσον δή μοι σκόλιόν τι λαβὼν Ἀλκαίου κἀνακρέοντος.	as Aristophanes says in his Daitaleis, where we find this line— Come, then. a scolium sing to me, Of old Alcæus or Anacreon.
εἰδὼς δὲ ὅτι καὶ οἱ ναῦται πολλὰ ἔχουσι,	But being aware that his sailors too had taken much plunder,
τὸ δ’ ἑῷόν ἐστι παράμηκες εἰς στενὸν τελευτῶν μυχὸν τὸν κατὰ Διοσκουριάδα ἐπὶ πεντακισχιλίους ἢ μικρῷ πλείους σταδίους, τὸ δὲ πλάτος περὶ τρισχιλίους·	The eastern portion is oblong and terminates in the narrow recess in which Dioscurias is situated. In length it is 5000 stadia, or rather more, and in breadth about 3000.
Καῖσαρ δὲ τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν πολλοὺς διῆκεν, ὁπόσοι δὲ συγγενεῖς ὄντες Ἡρώδου συνεστράτευον αὐτοῖς τούσδε ἐκόλασεν μόνους, εἰ μηδὲν φροντίσαντες τοῦ δικαίου κατὰ τῶν οἰκείων ἐστράτευον.	but for the several relations of Herod who had been among these men in this war, they were the only persons whom he punished, who, without the least regard to justice, fought against their own kindred.
’ Ἕρμιππος δὲ ἐν τῷ περὶ Γοργίου ‘ὡς ἐπεδήμησε, φησί, ταῖς Ἀθήναις Γοργίας μετὰ τὸ ποιήσασθαι τὴν ἀνάθεσιν τῆς ἐν Δελφοῖς ἑαυτοῦ χρυσῆς εἰκόνος, εἰπόντος τοῦ Πλάτωνος, ὅτε εἶδεν αὐτόν, ‘ἥκει ἡμῖν ὁ καλός τε καὶ χρυσοῦς Γοργίας,’ ἔφη ὁ Γοργίας· ‘ἦ καλόν γε αἱ Ἀθῆναι νέον τοῦτον Ἀρχίλοχον ἐνηνόχασιν.	And Hermippus, in his book on Gorgias, says,—When Gorgias was sojourning at Athens, after he had offered up at Delphi the golden image of himself which is there now, and when Plato said when he had seen it, The beautiful and golden Gorgias is come among us, Gorgias replied, This is indeed a fine young Archilochus whom Athens has now brought forth.
ὁρᾷς γὰρ ὅτι καὶ Πλάτων ἐν τῷ Συμποσίῳ περὶ τέλους διαλεγόμενος καὶ τοῦ πρώτου ἀγαθοῦ καὶ ὅλως θεολογῶν οὐκ ἐντείνει τὴν ἀπόδειξιν οὐδ’ ὑποκονίεται, τὴν λαβὴν ὥσπερ εἴωθεν εὔτονον ποιῶν καὶ ἄφυκτον, ἀλλ’ ὑγροτέροις λήμμασι καὶ παραδείγμασι καὶ μυθολογίαις προσάγεται τοὺς ἄνδρας.	You see that even Plato in his Symposium, where he disputes of the chief end, the chief good, and is altogether on subjects theological, doth not lay down strong and close demonstrations he doth not prepare himself for the contest (as he is wont) like a wrestler, that he may take the faster hold of his adversary and be sure of giving him the trip but he draws men on by more soft and pliable attacks, by pleasant fictions and pat examples.
τὰ δὲ κατὰ τὴν Σαρδόνα, καθάπερ ἐπάνω προεῖπον, ἐτύγχανεν ἀπηλλοτριωμένα, μεγάλας αὐτοῖς αἰεί ποτε χρείας παρεχομένης τῆς νήσου ταύτης κατὰ τὰς περιστάσεις.	This was all the more fatal because Sardinia was lost to them at the time, as we have seen, and that island had always been of the greatest service to them in difficulties of this sort.
ἡμεῖς δὲ πατρὸς τύμβον, ὡς ἐφίετο, λοιβαῖσι πρῶτον καὶ καρατόμοις χλιδαῖς στέψαντες εἶτ’ ἄψορρον ἥξομεν πάλιν, τύπωμα χαλκόπλευρον ἠρμένοι χεροῖν, ὃ καὶ σὺ θάμνοις οἶσθά που κεκρυμμένον, ὅπως λόγῳ κλέπτοντες ἡδεῖαν φάτιν φέρωμεν αὐτοῖς, τοὐμὸν ὡς ἔρρει δέμας φλογιστὸν ἤδη καὶ κατηνθρακωμένον.	Meanwhile, we will first crown my father’s tomb as the god ordered with libations and the luxuriant tribute of a severed lock then we will return here, bearing in our hands an urn of hammered bronze —now hidden, as you no doubt know, in the brushwood—so that we may gladden them with the false tidings that this body of mine exists no more, but has been consumed with fire and reduced to ashes.
πειρῶ οὖν, μεμνημένος διότι σοι πίστιν τὴν ἀναγκαιοτάτην παρακατατίθεμαι, δίκαιος ἡμῖν εἶναι, ὅπως ὅσον ἐπὶ σοὶ τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ εὐσχημόνως ᾖ μοι διῳκημένα.	Remember then that I have reposed the most absolute confidence in you, and strive to deal justly by me, in order that, so far as you are concerned, the provisions I have made may be carried out with fitting dignity.
πλεῖσται γὰρ πόλεις τῶν δεομένων τῆς θαλάττης περὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν πόλιν οἰκοῦσι, καὶ αὗται πᾶσαι ἀσθενέστεραι τῆς ὑμετέρας.	For most of the states which are dependent upon the sea are situated round about your state, and they are all weaker than yours.
καὶ συνήντησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν ὀρινήν, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὸν Εὐφράτην καὶ τὸν Τίγριν καὶ τὸν Ὑδάσπην, καὶ πεδίῳ Ἀριὼχ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐλυμαίων· καὶ συνῆλθον ἔθνη πολλὰ εἰς παράταξιν υἱῶν Χελεούλ.	And all the people living in the hill country joined together with him and all the people living beside the Euphrates and the Tigris and the Hydaspes and the plain of Erich, king over the Elymeans. Many nations gathered together to join forces with the descendants of the Chaldeans.
οὐ μήν, ἐπειδὴ τυγχάνεις Ἀργεῖος ὤν, ἀλλ’ ὧν γε δυνατὸν οὐδ’ ἐγὼ λείψω χάριν.	Yet indeed, since you happen to be an Argive, I too will not leave out any favor that I can do.
Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς Τωβίας εἶπεν αὐτῷ Πάτερ, ποιήσω πάντα ὅσα ἐντέταλσαί μοι.	Then Tobias answered and said to him, “Father, I will do all things that you have commanded me.
μέχρι μὲν δὴ τούτων ταύτῃ μοι βεβοηθημένον ἐγεγόνει φιλοσοφίᾳ καὶ φίλοις· τὸ δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐζῶμεν ἐγὼ καὶ Διονύσιος, ἐγὼ μὲν βλέπων ἔξω, καθάπερ ὄρνις ποθῶν ποθεν ἀναπτέσθαι, ὁ δὲ διαμηχανώμενος τίνα τρόπον ἀνασοβήσοι με μηδὲν ἀποδοὺς τῶν Δίωνος·	Now up to this time I had been assisting in this way philosophy and my friends but after this, the kind of life we lived, Dionysius and I, was this—I was gazing out of my cage, like a bird that is longing to fly off and away, while he was scheming how he might shoo me back without paying away any of Dion’s money
ὁ δὲ οὐ φροντίσας ἐπέμεινε τῷ πολέμῳ, μέχρι ὑπηγάγετο αὐτήν, Λασθένει συνθέμενος ὅμοια Πανάρει.	Metellus paid no attention to this order, but pushed on the war until the island was subdued, making the same terms with Lasthenes as he had made with Panares.
τοὺς δὲ ἵππους τοῦ ἅρματος χαλκοῖς πᾶσι προβλήμασι κατεσκευάσατο.	and he had the horses of his chariot equipped with armour of solid bronze.
καὶ ἐγένετο ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι αὐτοὺς ὅτι ἐπολέμησεν Κύριος πρὸς τοὺς ὑπεναντίους Ἰσραήλ.	The terror of the Lord came upon all the dominions of the land when they heard that the Lord had made war against the enemies of Israel.
χρηστοὶ δὲ καὶ δίκαιοι παῖδες οὐ μόνον διὰ τοὺς γονεῖς ἀγαπήσουσι μᾶλλον ἀλλήλους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς γονεῖς δι’ ἀλλήλους·	Now those who are truly ingenious do not only love one another the more entirely for the sake of their common parents, but they love their very parents for the sake of one another
εἶτα ἄμβωνας ὁ κώθων ἔχων ὑπολείπει τὸ οὐ καθαρὸν ἐν αὑτῷ.	and, secondly, as its brim is rather curved inwards, it is likely to retain what is not quite clean in it.
καὶ μὴν τῶν γε μιμημάτων τούτων καὶ εἰδώλων ὁ ποιητὴς καὶ δημιουργὸς ἐπιγέγραπται γράψε Πολύγνωτος, Θάσιος γένος, Ἀγλαοφῶντος υἱὸς περθομέναν Ἰλίου ἀκρόπολιν ὡς ὁρᾶται γράψας·	And we see the name of the artist set on all such pieces, according to that, ’Twas Thasian Polygnotus, Aglaophon’s son, That drew this draught of conquer’d Ilium.
Μίνως δὲ ἐν τῷ λαβυρίνθῳ κατά τινας χρησμοὺς κατακλείσας αὐτὸν ἐφύλαττεν.	and Minos, in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth.
ἀμὴν λέγω σοι· οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃς ἐκεῖθεν ἕως ἂν ἀποδῷς τὸν ἔσχατον κοδράντην.	I tell you the truth, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny!
πτεροφόροι νεάνιδες, παρθένοι Χθονὸς κόραι Σειρῆνες, εἴθ’ ἐμοῖς γόοις μόλοιτ’ ἔχουσαι Λίβυν λωτὸν ἢ σύριγγας ἢ φόρμιγγας, αἰλίνοις κακοῖς τοῖς ἐμοῖσι σύνοχα δάκρυα·	Winged maidens, virgin daughters of Earth, the Sirens, may you come to my mourning with Libyan flute or pipe or lyre, tears to match my plaintive woes
ὅντινα μέντοι χρὴ τρόπον πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἰπεῖν περὶ αὐτῶν, τοῦτο παμπόλλην δυσκολίαν ἔχειν νομίζω, οὐχ ὡς οὐ συνησόντων ὅ τι ἄν τις λέγῃ, ἀλλ’ οὕτω πολλὰ καὶ ψευδῆ καὶ πάντα μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ βέλτιστα τοῖς πράγμασιν συνειθίσθαι μοι δοκεῖτ’ ἀκούειν, ὥστε δέδοικα μὴ τῷ νῦν τὰ βέλτιστ’ εἰπόντι, ἣν τοῖς ἐξηπατηκόσιν προσῆκεν ἀπέχθειαν ὑπάρχειν παρ’ ὑμῶν, ταύτην ἀπενέγκασθαι συμβῇ.	I judge, on the other hand, that the manner in which I must speak to you about them means very grave irritation not because you will fail to understand what a person will say but because you seem to me to have become so accustomed to hearing many untruths and anything rather than what best meets your needs, that I fear it may be the lot of the man who now makes the best proposal to earn for his reward at your hands the hostility which would properly have been the due of those who have deceived you.
Εἶπεν δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν Τάδε ἐρεῖς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἀναγγελεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ Ὑμεῖς ἑωράκατε ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ λελάληκα πρὸς ὑμᾶς·	And then the Lord said to Moses, “These things you will report to the house of Jacob and announce to the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that from heaven I have spoken with you.
οὐκοῦν τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο σκεπτέον εἰ δόξῃ τε καὶ λόγῳ μείγνυται.	So the next thing is to inquire whether it mingles with opinion and speech.
Καὶ ταῦτα φάγεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι· πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν ἐν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια καὶ λεπίδες φάγεσθε.	“And these you may eat from all in the water: all that are in it with fins and scales you may eat.
τῶν γὰρ Ἀντιφίλου τις οἰκετῶν ἧκεν ἐπιστολὰς κομίζων ἀπὸ Ῥώμης παρὰ Λιουίας θεραπαινίδος Ἀκμῆς τοὔνομα.	for one of Antiphilus's domestic servants came, and brought letters from Rome, from a maid-servant of Julia, [Caesar's wife,] whose name was Acme.
Καὶ ὅσοι ἂν μὴ δέξωνται ὑμᾶς, μηδὲ ἀκούσωσιν ὑμῶν, ἐκπορευόμενοι ἐκεῖθεν, ἐκτινάξατε τὸν χοῦν τὸν ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς. Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται Σοδόμοις ἢ Γομόρροις ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ.	"And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"
ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἐγγράφωσιν, αὐτοὶ ὀφειλόντων.	And if they fail to make such reports, they shall themselves be liable for the amount.
ἥνδανεν ἀνθρώποις, ὁ δ’ ἐπὶ πλέον ἥνδανε Μούσαις Κράντωρ, καὶ γήρως ἤλυθεν οὔτι πρόσω.	Pleasing to men, more pleasing to the Muses, lived Crantor, and never saw old age.
καὶ ἡμεῖς οὖν ἀπροσδεεῖς τούτων ὄντες, παράκλησιν ἔχοντες τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια τὰ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν,	We, therefore, being without need of these things since we have the encouragement of the holy books in our hands,
δύσκολον γάρ ἐστι καὶ τὸ ἐπὶ σχοινίου περιπατεῖν καὶ οὐ μόνον δύσκολον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπικίνδυνον.	For it is difficult even to walk on a rope and not only difficult, but it is also dangerous.
Ἑρμείας δὲ κατὰ τοὺς καιροὺς τούτους ἐδεδίει μὲν τὴν εἰς τοὺς ἄνω τόπους στρατείαν διὰ τὸν κίνδυνον, ὠρέγετο δὲ κατὰ τὴν ἐξ ἀρχῆς πρόθεσιν τῆς ἐπὶ τὸν Πτολεμαῖον στρατείας·	But Hermeias was at that time afraid of an expedition farther up country, owing to its danger and was always yearning for the expedition against Ptolemy in accordance with his original plan.
ὁμολογουμένης δ’ εἶναι τῆς συνθήκης, οἰκείας μὲν οὔσης αὐξητέον·	When the existence of the contract is admitted, if it is in our favor, we must strengthen it by asserting that the contract is a law, special and partial
καὶ ἐν πάσαις ὁδοῖς κοπετός, διότι ἐλεύσομαι διὰ μέσου σου, εἶπεν Κύριος.	and in all roads there will be mourning, because I will go through your midst,” said the Lord.
ἀλλὰ ταῖς Αἰμιλίου παρῆν εὐχαῖς ὁ θεός· εὔχετο γὰρ κράτος πολέμου καὶ νίκην δόρυ κρατῶν, καὶ μαχόμενος παρεκάλει σύμμαχον τόν θεόν.	But the god listened to the prayers of Aemilius, who kept wielding his spear as he prayed for might and victory, and fought as he invited the god to fight with him.
ἐὰν δὲ ξένος ὁ τελευτήσας ᾖ, καὶ τῆς τοῦ ξένου χώρας εἰργέσθω τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους.	and if the dead man be a Stranger, he shall be barred also from the Stranger’s country for the same period.
καὶ γὰρ οὖν ἄλλα τε πολλὰ δικαίως αὐτῷ διεχειρίζετο καὶ στρατεύματι ἀληθινῷ ἐχρήσατο.	For, in fact, he not only justly managed others ( of other sorts ) and many [ things ] for himself, but he also furnished himself with a true army.
οὐ γάρ τις οἶκτος σῆς μ’ ὑπέρχεται φυγῆς.	no pity for thy exile steals into my heart.
ἡ δὲ γυμνοπαιδικὴ παρεμφερής ἐστι τῇ τραγικῇ ὀρχήσει, ἥτις ἐμμέλεια καλεῖται·	But the dance called Gymnopædica is like the dance in tragedy which is called Emmelea
Μετὰ ταῦτα δ' ἀπὸ Ῥώμης ὑπέστρεφεν ὁ βασιλεύς, τῶν μὲν ἐγκλημάτων ἀφιέναι τοὺς υἱοὺς δοκῶν, τῆς δ' ὑπονοίας οὐκ ἀπηλλαγμένος: παρηκολούθει γὰρ Ἀντίπατρος ἡ τοῦ μίσους ὑπόθεσις. ἀλλ' εἴς γε τὸ φανερὸν τὴν ἀπέχθειαν οὐκ ἐξέφερεν τὸν διαλλακτὴν αἰδούμενος.	Then the king returned from Rome, having seemingly forgiven these charges against his sons, but he still held them in suspicion. He was accompanied by Antipater, the source of the hatred, who did not publicly show his hand, out of reverence for the one who had reconciled them.
πρὸς γοῦν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἔργων, ἃ δι’ ἐκεῖνον ἡμῖν ἤδη πέπρακται, μὴ καταφρονήσητε τῶν λεγομένων εἰς ἐμὲ τὸν λέγοντα ἀφορῶντες μηδ’ ὅτι γλῶττα ἀνθρωπίνη πρὸς ὑμᾶς λέγει·	I therefore charge you, for his sake and the sake of his works, and what we have done by his means, that you do not put a low value on what I am going to say, because the commands have been given by me that now deliver them to you, nor because it is the tongue of a man that delivers them to you
ἐν δὲ τῷ μεταξὺ Μιτυλήνης καὶ τῆς Μηθύμνης κατὰ κώμην τῆς Μηθυμναίας καλουμένην Αἴγειρον στενωτάτη ἐστὶν ἡ νῆσος, ὑπέρβασιν ἔχουσα εἰς τὸν Πυρραίων εὔριπον σταδίων εἴκοσιν.	In the interval between Mitylene and Methymna, at a village called geirus in the Methymnan territory, is the narrowest part of the island, having a passage of 20 stadia to the Pyrrhan Euripus.
εἴρηται μὲν οὖν μοι καὶ πρότερον περὶ αὐτῶν, λεχθήσεται δὲ καὶ νῦν ἀκριβῶς.	I have said something of this before, but will now speak of it in detail.
πονηρὸν γὰρ νυκτός ἐστι στράτευμα Περσικόν.	For a Persian army at night is a sorry thing.
Πρόξενος δ’ ἐν δευτέρῳ Λακωνικῆς πολιτείας ἐπικαλεῖσθαί φησιν χαλκίδας παρὰ Λακεδαιμονίοις τὰς θεραπαίνας.	But Proxenus, in the second book of his treatise on the Lacedæmonian Constitution, says that female servants are called among the Lacedæmonians, Chalcides.
μνησθήσομαι δὲ ἑνὸς ἀπὸ πολλῶν, πόλις ἐστι τῆς Σικελίας Ἐγγύϊον οὐ μεγάλη, ἀρχαία δὲ πάνυ καὶ διὰ θεῶν ἐπιφάνειαν ἔνδοξος, ἃς καλοῦσι Ματέρας.	And I will mention one instance out of many. There is a city of Sicily called Engyium, not large, but very ancient, and famous for the appearance there of goddesses, who are called Mothers.
ὕπαρχος δ’ ἦν αὐτῆς Τιρίβαζος, ὁ καὶ βασιλεῖ φίλος γενόμενος, καὶ ὁπότε παρείη, οὐδεὶς ἄλλος βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον ἀνέβαλλεν.	Its lieutenant-governor was Tiribazus, who had proved himself a friend to the King and, so often as he was present, was the only man permitted to help the King mount his horse.
τοῦ δὲ ἄντρου κατὰ τὰς ἔξωθεν ῥίζας ἀνατέλλουσιν αἱ πηγαί·	Now the fountains of Jordan rise at the roots of this cavity outwardly
ἀξύλου γὰρ ὑπαρχούσης σχεδόν τι τῆς συμπάσης Καππαδοκίας ὁ Ἀργαῖος ἔχει περικείμενον δρυμὸν ὥστε ἐγγύθεν ὁ ξυλισμὸς πάρεστιν, ἀλλ’ οἱ ὑποκείμενοι τῷ δρυμῷ τόποι καὶ αὐτοὶ πολλαχοῦ πυρὰ ἔχουσιν, ἅμα δὲ καὶ ὕφυδροί εἰσι ψυχρῷ ὕδατι, οὔτε τοῦ πυρὸς οὔτε τοῦ ὕδατος εἰς τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν ἐκκύπτοντος, ὥστε καὶ ποάζειν τὴν πλείστην·	For though nearly the whole of Cappadocia is without timber, the Argus is surrounded by a forest, so that wood may be procured near at hand, yet even the region lying below the forest contains fire in many parts, and springs of cold water but as neither the fire nor the water break out upon the surface, the greatest part of the country is covered with herbage.
καὶ τοὺς παῖδας δέ, οἳ ἂν ἡμῶν γίγνωνται, ἐνθάδε παιδεύωμεν·	And as for our boys, as many as shall be born to us, let us educate them here.
Μέτελλος δ’ ὁ γέρων ἕτερόν τι τοιοῦτον ἐπερωτώμενος ἐπὶ στρατείας εἰ φησὶν ᾤμην τὸν χιτῶνά μοι συνειδέναι τοῦτο τἀπόρρητον, ἀποδυσάμενος ἂν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ ἔθηκα Εὐμένης δ’ ἀκούσας ἐπέρχεσθαι Κρατερὸν οὐδενὶ τῶν φίλων ἔφρασεν, ἀλλ’ ἐψεύσατο Νεοπτόλεμον εἶναι·	Metellus also, that old soldier, being asked some such question about the intended march of his army, If I thought, said he, that my shirt were privy to this secret, I would pull it off and throw it into the fire. Eumenes also, when he heard that Craterus was marching with his forces against him, said not a word of it to his best friend, but gave out all along that it was Neoptolemus
κἀν ταύτῃ κεραυνοῦ πεσόντος ἐς τὸ τῆς Σελήνης καὶ τὸ τῆς Δήμητρος ἱερὸν οἱ μάντεις ὑπὲρ τὰς θερινὰς τροπὰς ἀνετίθεντο τὰς χειροτονίας, καὶ μόνος ἦρχεν ὁ Κάρβων.	When that day came lightning struck the temples of Luna and of Ceres so the augurs prorogued the comitia beyond the summer solstice, and Carbo remained the sole consul.
ι Ἀριστοφάνης Εἰρήνῃ· τί δῆτ’ ἂν εἰ πίοις οἴνου κύλικα λεπαστήν;	Aristophanes, in his Peace, says— What will you do, then, when you've drunk One single lepaste full of new wine?
ἔτι οἱ λόγοι ἐν προσθέσει ἀριθμῶν εἰσὶν οἱ τῶν μίξεων, οὐκ ἐν ἀριθμοῖς, οἷον τρία πρὸς δύο ἀλλ᾽ οὐ τρὶς δύο. τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ δεῖ γένος εἶναι ἐν ταῖς πολλαπλασιώσεσιν, ὥστε δεῖ μετρεῖσθαι τῷ τε Α τὸν στοῖχον ἐφ᾽ οὗ ΑΒΓ καὶ τῷ Δ τὸν ΔΕΖ·	it would be more beneficial mixed in no particular proportion, provided that it be diluted, than mixed in an arithmetical proportion, but strong. again, the ratios of mixtures are expressed by the relation of numbers, and not simply by numbers; e. g., it is 3: 2, not 3 x 2; for in products of multiplication the units must belong to the same genus. thus the product of 1 x 2 x 3 must be measurable by 1, and the product of 4 x 5 x 7
διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιμαίνοντας τὸν λαόν μου Ὑμεῖς διεσκορπίσατε τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ ἐξώσατε αὐτὰ καὶ οὐκ ἐπεσκέψασθε αὐτά, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικῶ ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς κατὰ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν.	⌊Therefore⌋ this is what the Lord says against those who shepherd my people: “You have scattered my sheep and thrust them out and not looked after them. Look! I will take revenge upon you according to your evil pursuits.
ἐν δὲ τῷ τρόπῳ ἑκάστῳ πλέονες ἰδέαι γίγνονται· καὶ περὶ μὲν φλάσιός τε καὶ Ῥωγμῆς, ἢν ἄμφω ταῦτα προσγένηται τῇ ἕδρῃ, καὶ ἢν φλάσις μούνη γένηται, ἤδη πέφρασται, ὅτι πολλαὶ ἰδέαι γίνονται καὶ τῆς φλάσιος καὶ τῆς Ῥωγμῆς.	In each of these modes there are many varieties, with regard to the contusion and fracture, if both these be combined with the hedra, or if contusion alone, as it has been already stated that there are many varieties of contusion and fracture.
εἰ δ᾽ ἕκαστον μὲν γνωρίζομεν διὰ τῶν ὁρισμῶν, ἀρχαὶ δὲ τὰ γένη τῶν ὁρισμῶν εἰσίν, ἀνάγκη καὶ τῶν ὁριστῶν ἀρχὰς εἶναι τὰ γένη.	but from the point of view that it is through definitions that we get to know each particular thing, and that the genera are the first principles of definitions, the genera must also be the first principles of the things defined.
χρωμένων δὲ τῇ πείρᾳ τῶν Ἀντιοχέων ὀλίγοι μὲν ὑπέμειναν, οἱ δὲ μὴ βουληθέντες ἀνῃρέθησαν.	and when the people of Antioch tried the experiment, some few complied, but those that would not do so were slain.
Διόδωρος δ’ ὁ Σικελιώτης ἐν τοῖς περὶ Βιβλιοθήκης Ἀκραγαντίνους φησὶ κατασκευάσαι Γέλωνι κολυμβήθραν πολυτελῆ τὸ περίμετρον ἔχουσαν σταδίων ζ’, βάθος δὲ πηχῶν κ’, εἰς ἣν ἐπαγομένων ποταμίων καὶ κρηναίων ὑδάτων ἰχθυοτροφεῖον εἶναι καὶ πολλοὺς παρέχεσθαι ἰχθῦς εἰς τὴν τρυφὴν καὶ ἀπόλαυσιν τῷ Γέλωνι·	But Diodorus Siculus, in his books On the Library, says that the citizens of Agrigentum prepared for Gelon a very costly swimming-bath, being seven stadia in circumference and twenty cubits deep and water was introduced into it from the rivers and fountains, and it serve for a great pond to breed fish in, and supplied great quantities of fish for the luxury and enjoyment of Gelon.
διόπερ ἠγωνία μὴ ταύτης ὁ Φίλιππος τῆς ἐλπίδος ἀντιλαμβανόμενος ἐπὶ τὸ πολιοφυλακεῖν ὁρμήσῃ καὶ τρίβειν τὸν πόλεμον, εἶθ’ ἑτέρου παραγενηθέντος ὑπάτου τὸ κεφάλαιον τῶν πράξεων εἰς ἐκεῖνον ἀνακλασθῇ.	Therefore he was anxious lest Philip, catching at this chance, should determine to defend the towns and protract the war and lest meanwhile he should himself be superseded by another commander from home, on whom the honour of all that he had achieved would be diverted.
ἢ γὰρ κατηγοροῦντός τινος τῶν οἰκετῶν ἢ ἀπολογουμένου ἀκούσας ἐλέγχειν πειρῶμαι, ἢ μέμφομαί τινα πρὸς τοὺς φίλους ἢ ἐπαινῶ, ἢ διαλλάττω τινὰς τῶν ἐπιτηδείων πειρώμενος διδάσκειν ὡς συμφέρει αὐτοῖς φίλους εἶναι μᾶλλον ἢ πολεμίους, ἢ ἐπιτιμῶμέν τινι στρατηγῷ συμπαρόντες, ἢ ἀπολογούμεθα ὑπέρ του, εἴ τις ἀδίκως αἰτίαν ἔχει, ἢ κατηγοροῦμεν πρὸς ἀλλήλους, εἴ τις ἀδίκως τιμᾶται.	For I get one of the servants to act as prosecutor or defendant, and try to confute him or I praise or blame someone before his friends or I act as peace-maker between some of my acquaintances by trying to show them that it is to their interest to be friends rather than enemies. I assist at a court-martial and censure a soldier, or take turns in defending a man who is unjustly blamed, or in accusing one who is unjustly honoured.
πρὸς δὲ τῷ στόματι κώμην οἰκεῖσθαι τὴν ὑποδεχομένην τὰ ἐκ τῆς Ἀραβίας φορτία·	at its mouth is a village, which receives the merchandise from Arabia
εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου ἐν ὁλοκαυτώμασιν, ἀποδώσω σοι τὰς εὐχάς μου,	I will enter into your house with whole burnt offerings; I will give to you my vows,
δεῖξόν μοι, ὅτι, ἄν τις τινὶ τὰ αὑτοῦ ἐξείπῃ, ἐκεῖνος πιστός ἐστι καὶ αἰδήμων.	Show me that if one man tells his affairs to another, he who tells them is faithful and modest.
ῥοιὰν μὲν δὴ οὕτω κατεῖχεν ὡς μήτε ἄλλῳ παρεῖναι βιαζομένῳ μήτε αὐτὸς λυμήνασθαι πιέζων, ἱστάμενος δὲ ἐπὶ ἀληλιμμένῳ τῷ δίσκῳ γέλωτα ἐποιεῖτο τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντάς τε καὶ ὠθοῦντας ἀπὸ τοῦ δίσκου.	He would grasp a pomegranate so firmly that nobody could wrest it from him by force, and yet he did not damage it by pressure. He would stand upon a greased quoit, and make fools of those who charged him and tried to push him from the quoit.
ἔστι δὲ κώμη μετρία, τὸν Ἀσκληπιὸν ἔχουσα τὸν Κολώτου, θαυμαστὸν ἰδεῖν ξόανον ἐλεφάντινον.	It is a village of moderate size, in which is preserved the sculapius of Colotes, a statue of ivory, of admirable workmanship.
μισθὸς μὲν ἡμῖν, ὦ ἄνδρες, εἴργασται τῇ στρατιᾷ ἐγγὺς ἐνιαυτοῦ ὀκτακισχιλίοις ἀνδράσιν·	Gentlemen, we have earned pay for the army—eight thousand men—for almost a year
Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυείδ· ἐξοδίου σκηνῆς. Ἐνέγκατε τῷ κυρίῳ, υἱοὶ θεοῦ, ἐνέγκατε τῷ κυρίῳ υἱοὺς κριῶν· ἐνέγκατε τῷ κυρίῳ δόξαν καὶ τιμήν,	A psalm of David commemorating the feast of Exodus, of the temple.
ἔτυχεν δὲ οὖσα ἑορτὴ τὰ Παρίλια μὲν πάλαι καλουμένη, νῦν δὲ Ῥωμαῖα, τῇ τῆς πόλεως Τύχῃ ναοῦ καθιδρυμένου ὑπὸ τοῦ πάντα ἀρίστου καὶ μουσικωτάτου βασιλέως Ἀδριανοῦ·	And it happened to be the time of a festival which used formerly to be called the Parilia, but which is now called the Romana, in honour of the temple built to the Fortune of the City, by that most excellent and accomplished sovereign Hadrian.
οἶσθα οὖν μηνύσαντα Ἀνδρόμαχον τὰ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τῇ Πουλυτίωνος γιγνόμενα;	You recollect that Andromachus laid an information as to what was going on in Pulytion's house?
οὗτοι οἱ ἄρτοι, θερμοὺς ἐφωδιάσθημεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξήλθομεν παραγενέσθαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, νῦν δὲ ἐξηράνθησαν καὶ γεγόνασιν βεβρωμένοι·	These loaves, we prepared them warm on the day that we left to come to you. But now they are dried up and have become eaten by mold.
ἀλλ’ ἀνόητος μὲν ἄνθρωπος τάχ’ ἂν οἰηθείη ταῦτα, φευκτέον εἶναι ἀπὸ τοῦ δεσπότου, καὶ οὐκ ἂν λογίζοιτο ὅτι οὐ δεῖ ἀπό γε τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ φεύγειν ἀλλ’ ὅτι μάλιστα παραμένειν, διὸ ἀλογίστως ἂν φεύγοι·	A foolish man might perhaps think so, that he ought to run away from his master, and he would not consider that he must not run away from a good master, but ought to stay with him as long as possible and so he might thoughtlessly run away
Ἰωσήπου δὲ τοὺς μὲν ἀπολύοντος, οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτὸν ἀδικεῖν, ἀρκεῖσθαι δὲ μόνῃ τῇ τοῦ παιδὸς τιμωρίᾳ λέγοντος, οὔτε γὰρ τοῦτον ἀπολύειν διὰ τοὺς οὐδὲν ἐξαμαρτόντας σῶφρον ἔλεγεν οὔτε συγκολάζειν ἐκείνους τῷ τὴν κλοπὴν εἰργασμένῳ, βαδιοῦσι δὲ παρέξειν ἀσφάλειαν ἐπαγγελλομένου,	But Joseph dismissed them, declaring that they had committed no offense and that he would be content with punishing the lad. He said it was not right to let him go free just because the otherse were innocent, nor should they be punished along with the one who had stolen. When he promised to let them leave in safety, the rest of them were woebegone and unable to speak for sadness.
οὐκ ἂν ἄρα τήν γε φύσιν τοῦ ὑέος αὐτοῦ ᾐτιάσατ’ ἄν τις εἶναι κακήν.	Then there could be no complaints of badness in his son’s nature?
αἵδ’ ἐπιστολαί, τάδ’ ἐστὶ τἀν δέλτοισιν ἐγγεγραμμένα.	This is my letter, this is the writing in the tablet.
διαπλεύσας δὲ καὶ ὁ Πεδάριτος πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἀναζητήσαντες τὰ περὶ τῶν δοκούντων προδιδόναι, ὡς ηὗρον ἅπαν ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐκ τῆς Σάμου προφασισθέν, ἀπολύσαντες τῆς αἰτίας ἀπέπλευσαν ὁ μὲν ἐς τὴν Χίον, ὁ δὲ ἐς τὴν Μίλητον ἐκομίσθη, ὥσπερ διενοεῖτο.	Here Pedaritus sailed over to join him and after inquiry into the pretended treachery, finding that the whole story had been made up to procure the escape of the men from Samos, they acquitted them of the charge, and sailed away, Pedaritus to Chios and Astyochus to Miletus, as he had intended.
καὶ ἀναστήσεις τὴν σκηνὴν κατὰ τὸ εἶδος τὸ δεδειγμένον σοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει.	And you will set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.
φθέγμα δ’ ἐξαίφνης τινὸς θώϋξεν αὐτόν, ὥστε πάντας ὀρθίας στῆσαι φόβῳ δείσαντας ἐξαίφνης τρίχας, καλεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν πολλὰ πολλαχῇ θεός·	suddenly a voice called aloud to him, so that everyone felt hair rising from the sudden terror. The god called him again and again
ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἤτασεν τοὺς δύο εὐνούχους καὶ ἐκρέμασεν αὐτούς· καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καταχωρίσαι εἰς μνημόσυνον ἐν τῇ βασιλικῇ βιβλιοθήκῃ ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐνοίας Μαρδοχαίου ἐν ἐγκωμίῳ.	Then the king examined the two eunuchs and hanged them. And the king ordered that a memorial be recorded in the royal library in praise of Mordecai concerning his goodwill.
Ἀθηναίοις δὲ καὶ ἔξω πόλεως ἐν τοῖς δήμοις καὶ κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς θεῶν ἐστιν ἱερὰ καὶ ἡρώων καὶ ἀνδρῶν τάφοι·	Outside the city, too, in the parishes and on the roads, the Athenians have sanctuaries of the gods, and graves of heroes and of men.
καὶ Χάβερ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰφαμὴλ καὶ τὸν Σαμὴρ καὶ τὸν Χωθὰν καὶ τὴν Σωλὰ ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν.	Heber begat Japhlet and Shomer and Hotham and Shua, their sister.
τοιγαροῦν εἰς τοὺς πόρους ὁ χυμὸς ὁμαλῶς πανταχοῦ συνίσταται, χυμός, λέγει Δημόκριτος, οὐδὲν πρᾶγμα τὰ γινόμενα ποιεῖ τὸν φαγόντ’ ἀρθριτικόν.	B. Juice, say you? This is not known to Democritus. A. But all meats out of season make the eater Diseased in his joints.
καὶ νῦν μέν σε ἀφίημι, ἔφη, σὺν τῇ γυναικὶ δειπνεῖν·	And now I will take leave of you and let you go to dinner with your wife.
τὰς δὲ ἀφαιρέσιας μὴ μέσφι λειποθυμίης ποιέεσθαι, πρόκλησις γὰρ τοῦ πάθεος λειποθυμίη ·	but the abstraction is not to be carried the length of deliquium animi for deliquium has a tendency to induce the disease
ὥσθ’ οἱ μὲν ἄρχειν οὐκ ἐπίστανται, ἀλλ’ ἄρχεσθαι δουλικὴν ἀρχήν, οἱ δ’ ἄρχεσθαι μὲν οὐδεμίαν ἀρχήν, ἄρχειν δὲ δεσποτικὴν ἀρχήν.	Hence the latter class do not know how to govern but know how to submit togovernment of a servile kind, while the former class do not know how to submit to any government, and only know how to govern in the manner of a master.
ἐς δὲ τὴν ἐπίκλησιν αὐτῆς ἔστιν εἰκάζειν ὡς τῶν ἐν Κύπρῳ ποτὲ οἰκησάντων Τελχίνων ἀφικομένη μοῖρα ἐς Βοιωτοὺς ἱερὸν ἱδρύσατο Ἀθηνᾶς Τελχινίας.	As to her surname, we may hazard the conjecture that a division of the Telchinians who once dwelt in Cyprus came to Boeotia and established a sanctuary of Telchinian Athena.
ὅτε γὰρ ἀρσενικόν ἐστιν ὁ σκύφος, ὡς λύχνος, ἄνευ τοῦ σ προοισόμεθα, ὅτε δὲ οὐδέτερον τὸ σκύφος, σὺν τῷ σ κλινοῦμεν σκύφος σκύφους, ὡς τεῖχος τείχους.	for sometimes σκύθος is masculine, like λύχνος, and then we form its genitive case without ς but when σκύθος is neuter, then we must decline with the ς, σκύθος σκύθος, like τεῖχος τείχος..
καὶ σχεδόν τι οἶμαι ἐμὲ πλείω χρήματα εἰργάσθαι ἢ ἄλλους σύνδυο οὕστινας βούλει τῶν σοφιστῶν.	And I pretty well think I have made more money than any other two sophists together.
ἕτεροι δὲ εἰς τοὔδαφος ῥιφέντες ἔκειντο ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν βασάνων ἀθρόας προσβολῆς, δεινοτέραν τὴν ‘ὄψιν τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῖς ὁρῶσι παρέχοντες, ποικίλας καὶ διαφόρους ἐν τοῖς σώμασι φέροντες τῶν βασάνων τὰς ἐπινοίας.	Others were thrown to the ground and lay there, by reason οf the whole sale application οf the tortures presenting to those who saw them a sight more terrible than did the actual punishment, in that they bore on their bodies marks οf the manifold and varied tortures that were deVised.
ἀνδρῶν δ’ ἄριστον Κωβιὸν πηδῶντ’ ἔτι πρὸς Πυθιονίκην τὴν καλὴν πέμψαι με δεῖ· ἁδρὸς γάρ ἐστιν.	I ought to send this best of fish, this tench, Still all alive, and leaping in his dish, To the fair Pythionica, he's so fine
καὶ τὸ παράπαν γε ἀποδέχεσθαί του λέγοντος ὡς ἔστιν ὄνομά τι, λόγον οὐκ ἂν ἔχον.	And in general there would be no sense in accepting the statement that a name has any existence.
καὶ Φιλήσιον καὶ Σοφαίνετον τοὺς πρεσβυτάτους τῶν στρατηγῶν εἰσβιβάσαντες τούτων ἐκέλευον ἐπιμελεῖσθαι·	They put aboard also Philesius and Sophaenetus, the eldest of the generals, and bade them take charge of the enterprise
πότε γὰρ σκέπτῃ, εἰ τὰ μέλανα λευκά ἐστιν, εἰ τὰ βαρέα κοῦφα;	For do you ever have to consider whether black is white, or whether light is heavy?
ἀλλὰ ταῦτ’ ἤδη δύο ἐστὶν ἃ δεῖται σκέψεως, ἓν μὲν πότερος αἱρετώτερος βίος, ὁ διὰ τοῦ συμπολιτεύεσθαι καὶ κοινωνεῖν πόλεως ἢ μᾶλλον ὁ ξενικὸς καὶ τῆς πολιτικῆς κοινωνίας ἀπολελυμένος, ἔτι δὲ τίνα πολιτείαν θετέον καὶ ποίαν διάθεσιν πόλεως ἀρίστην, εἴτε πᾶσιν ὄντος αἱρετοῦ τοῦ κοινωνεῖν πόλεως εἴτε καὶ τισὶ μὲν μὴ τοῖς δὲ πλείστοις.	But there now arise these two questions that require consideration first, which mode of life is the more desirable, the life of active citizenship and participation in politics, or rather the life of an alien and that of detachment from the political partnership next, what constitution and what organization of a state is to be deemed the best,—either on the assumption that to take an active part in the state is desirable for everybody, or that it is undesirable for some men although desirable for most.
τὴν τετάρτην δὲ Ὀλυμπιάδα ἐπὶ ταῖς ἑκατόν πρώτην γὰρ δὴ ἐνίκησεν ὁ Σώστρατος ταύτην οὐκ ἀναγράφουσιν οἱ Ἠλεῖοι, διότι μὴ αὐτοὶ τὸν ἀγῶνα ἀλλὰ Πισαῖοι καὶ Ἀρκάδες ἔθεσαν ἀντ’ αὐτῶν.	The hundred and fourth Festival, when Sostratus won his first victory, is not reckoned by the Eleans, because the games were held by the Pisans and Arcadians and not by themselves.
εἶεν· τίνι τὸ πειστικὸν οὖν ἀποδώσομεν ἐπιστήμῃ πλήθους τε καὶ ὄχλου διὰ μυθολογίας ἀλλὰ μὴ διὰ διδαχῆς;	Well, then, to what science shall we assign the power of persuading a multitude or a mob by telling edifying stories, not by teaching?
φοβηθεὶς δὲ βασιλεὺς τὴν πόλιν, ἐπειδὴ ἑώρα Λακεδαιμονίους τῷ κατὰ θάλατταν πολέμῳ ἀπαγορεύοντας, ἀποστῆναι βουλόμενος ἐξῄτει τοὺς Ἕλληνας τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ, οὕσπερ πρότερον Λακεδαιμόνιοι αὐτῷ ἐξέδοσαν, εἰ μέλλοι συμμαχήσειν ἡμῖν τε καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις συμμάχοις, ἡγούμενος οὐκ ἐθελήσειν, ἵν’ αὐτῷ πρόφασις εἴη τῆς ἀποστάσεως.	But the King, becoming afraid of our city when he saw that the Lacedaemonians were desisting from the naval struggle, wished to desert us so he demanded the surrender of the Greeks in the Continent, whom the Lacedaemonians had formerly given over to him, as the price of his continuing his alliance with us and the other allies, thinking that we would refuse and thus furnish him with a pretext for his desertion.
ἅπερ ἂν πάθοι τις ἀκούων τὸν τοῦ Οἰδίποδος μῦθον.	So would anyone feel who heard the story of Oedipus.
πολλοὺς γοῦν πολυφίλους καὶ πολυτιμήτους ὄντας ἓν παιδίον γενόμενον ἀφίλους καὶ ἀδυνάτους ἐποίησεν.	Many, at any rate, who had many friends and much honour, the birth of one child has made friendless and powerless.
καὶ Μακελλὼθ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Σαμαά· καὶ οὗτοι ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν κατῴκησαν ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν.	Mikloth begat Shimea, and these dwelled in the midst of their brothers in Jerusalem, in the midst of their brothers.
ἐγὼ γὰρ βασανιῶ ταύτην καλῶς ἐκ τῶν ἱερῶν τῶν πέρυσι· σὺ δ᾽ ἀπόστηθί μοι, ἵνα μὴ ᾽ πακούσῃς ὢν ἀνήρ. σὺ δ᾽ εἰπέ μοι ὅ τι πρῶτον ἡμῖν τῶν ἱερῶν ἐδείκνυτο.	withdraw, all of you; i am going to examine her thoroughly about last year's mysteries. but move away, cleisthenes, for no man may hear what is going to be said. now answer my questions!
μηδ’ αὖ ὑπὸ τούτων ἀναπειθόμεναι αἱ μητέρες τὰ παιδία ἐκδειματούντων, λέγουσαι τοὺς μύθους κακῶς, ὡς ἄρα θεοί τινες περιέρχονται νύκτωρ πολλοῖς ξένοις καὶ παντοδαποῖς ἰνδαλλόμενοι, ἵνα μὴ ἅμα μὲν εἰς θεοὺς βλασφημῶσιν, ἅμα δὲ τοὺς παῖδας ἀπεργάζωνται δειλοτέρους.	Nor again must mothers under the influence of such poets terrify their children with harmful tales, how that there are certain gods whose apparitions haunt the night in the likeness of many strangers from all manner of lands, lest while they speak evil of the gods they at the same time make cowards of children.
ἐπεὶ δ’ οἱ στρατηγοὶ διὰ τὸ ἀξίωμα τῷ Ἀλκιβιάδῃ σπουδάζοντες ἐφαίνοντο περιθεῖναι τὴν δόξαν, ὁ Σωκράτης βουλόμενος αὔξεσθαι τὸ φιλότιμον ἐν τοῖς καλοῖς αὐτοῦ πρῶτος ἐμαρτύρει καὶ παρεκάλει στεφανοῦν ἐκεῖνον καὶ διδόναι τὴν πανοπλίαν.	but the generals, owing to the high position of Alcibiades, were manifestly anxious to give him the glory of it. Socrates, therefore, wishing to increase his pupil’s honorable ambitions, led all the rest in bearing witness to his bravery, and in begging that the crown and the suit of armour be given to him.
οὐ γὰρ ἔχω τούτου πραότερον πρόσταγμα τοῖς τοιαῦτ’ ἐξημαρτηκόσιν εἰς ἐμέ.	because I have no milder injunction for those who have committed this offence against me.
μὴ εἶναί τε αὐτάρκη τὸν λόγον πρὸς τὸ θαρρῆσαι καὶ τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης ὑπεράνω γενέσθαι·	Instruction is not sufficient in itself to inspire us with confidence and to make us rise superior to the opinion of the multitude.
ὀμόσαι δ’ Ἀθηναίους ἅπαντας καθ’ ἱερῶν τελείων, κατὰ φυλὰς καὶ κατὰ δήμους, ἀποκτενεῖν τὸν ταῦτα ποιήσαντα.	And all the Athenians shall take oath by tribes and by demes over a sacrifice without blemish to slay such an one.
ἀλλ’ εὔχεται οὐλομέναν νοῦσον διαντλήσαις ποτὲ οἶκον ἰδεῖν, ἐπ’ Ἀπόλλωνός τε κράνᾳ συμποσίας ἐφέπων θυμὸν ἐκδόσθαι πρὸς ἥβαν πολλάκις, ἔν τε σοφοῖς δαιδαλέαν φόρμιγγα βαστάζων πολίταις ἡσυχίᾳ θιγέμεν, μήτ’ ὦν τινι πῆμα πορών, ἀπαθὴς δ’ αὐτὸς πρὸς ἀστῶν.	But he prays that at some time, when he has drained to the dregs his cup of ruinous affliction, he will see his home, and, joining the symposium near the spring of Apollo, yield his spirit often to the joys of youth, and attain peace, holding the well-made lyre among his skillful fellow citizens, bringing no pain to anyone, and himself unharmed by his townsmen.
ἆρ’ οὖν τυφλὸς ἦν τὸν νοῦν Ἀπίων ὑπὲρ Αἰγυπτίων ἡμῖν λοιδορεῖν συνθέμενος, ἐκείνων δὲ κατηγορῶν, οἵ γε μὴ μόνον χρῶνται τοῖς ὑπὸ τούτου λοιδορουμένοις ἔθεσιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἐδίδαξαν περιτέμνεσθαι, καθάπερ εἴρηκεν Ἡρόδοτος;	Apion was therefore quite blinded in his mind, when, for the sake of the Egyptians, he contrived to reproach us, and to accuse such others as not only make use of that conduct of life which he so much abuses, but have also taught other men to be circumcised, as says Herodotus
καὶ ταύτης τῆς πρεσβείας οὐ κατηγόρεις μου διδόντος τὰς εὐθύνας, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ ταύτην ἥκεις τὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὅρκους, ὑπὲρ ἧς ἐγὼ σαφῶς καὶ δικαίως ἀπολογήσομαι.	and when I rendered account of my service on that embassy, you, Demosthenes, preferred no charge, but you proceed against my conduct on this embassy, the embassy that was appointed to receive the oaths.
μετὰ τούτους ἦν ὁ Ἰωάβου ἀδελφὸς Ἀβεσσαῖος:	Next to these was Abishai, Joab's brother, for in one day he killed six hundred.
ὁ γὰρ Φίλιππος τολμηρότερον καὶ πρακτικώτερον ἢ κατὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν χρώμενος ταῖς ἐπιβολαῖς εἰς ἀπορίαν καὶ δυσχρηστίαν ἅπαντας ἦγε τοὺς πολεμίους.	For the courage and energy beyond his years, with which Philip acted, reduced all his enemies to a state of the utmost difficulty and terror.
Ἐν τούτῳ δέ τινες τῶν Ἰουδαίων συνελθόντες νεωτέρων ἐπιθυμίᾳ πραγμάτων Ματθίαν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ ὑφ' Ἡρώδου ἀποθανόντας, οἳ παραχρῆμα τῆς εἰς τὸ πενθεῖσθαι τιμῆς φόβῳ τῷ ἐκείνου ἀπεστέρηντο, ἦσαν δὲ οἱ τῶν ἐπὶ καθαιρέσει τοῦ χρυσοῦ ἀετοῦ δεδικαιωμένων, ἐπὶ μέγα τε τῇ βοῇ καὶ οἰμωγῇ χρώμενοι καί τινα ὡς κούφισιν φέροντα τοῖς τεθνεῶσιν ἀπερρίπτουν εἰς τὸν βασιλέα.	Meanwhile some of the Jews gathered in rebellious mood. They lamented the affair of Matthias and those killed by Herod along with him, the men condemned for pulling down the golden eagle, who had not been properly mourned because the people feared him. There was loud shouting and complaint about it and insults were even hurled at the king as if to bring comfort to the dead.
οὐδέ γε τίς τέχνη δακτυλίους βελτίους ποιεῖ, ἀγνοοῦντες δακτύλιον.	Nor could we know what art makes rings better, if we had no cognizance of a ring.
ἐὰν δὲ ἀνανεύων ἀνανεύσῃ καὶ μὴ βούληται ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς δοῦναι αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα, ἀργύριον ἀποτίσει τῷ πατρὶ καθ᾽ ὅσον ἐστὶν ἡ φερνὴ τῶν παρθένων.	But if her father ⌊strongly refuses⌋ and is not willing to give her to him as a wife, he will pay out money to her father according to whatever is the bridal price of virgins.
ἐπαινοῦντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐν Τεγέᾳ μετὰ τὴν φυγὴν τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους, εἶπέ τις, διὰ τί οὖν οὐκ ἔμενες ἐν Σπάρτῃ ἀλλ’ ἔφυγες;	When banished and at Tegea, he commended the Lacedaemonians. One said to him, Why then did you not stay at Sparta?
χαλεπὸν γὰρ τὸ μετρίως εἰπεῖν ἐν ᾧ μόλις καὶ ἡ δόκησις τῆς ἀληθείας βεβαιοῦται.	For to speak of men in a just measure, is a hard matter and though one do so, yet he shall hardly get the truth firmly believed.
οἱ μὲν γὰρ αὐτῶν κόλακας καὶ παρασίτους ἀναλαμβάνουσιν, ἀνθρώπους ἀσήμους καὶ καταράτους καὶ τῆς νεότητος ἀνατροπέας καὶ λυμεῶνας, οἱ δέ τινες ἑταίρας καὶ χαμαιτύπας λυτροῦνται σοβαρὰς καὶ πολυτελεῖς, οἱ δὲ κατοψοφαγοῦσιν, οἱ δ’ εἰς κύβους καὶ κώμους ἐξοκέλλουσιν, ἤδη δέ τινες καὶ τῶν νεανικωτέρων ἅπτονται κακῶν, μοιχεύοντες καὶ οἰκοφθοροῦντες καὶ μίαν ἡδονὴν θανάτου τιμώμενοι.	For then do some of those children acquaint themselves with flatterers and parasites, a sort of infamous and execrable persons, the very pests that corrupt and ruin young men others maintain mistresses and harlots, insolent and extravagant others waste their substance others, again, come to shipwreck on gaming and revelling.
ἐνταῦτα νῦν οἰμῶξι πρὸς τὴν αἰτρίαν.	he speaks with a heavy foreign accent you shall stay here in the open air to wail.
οὐ γὰρ μόνον τὸ εὖ πράσσειν παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἀφορμὴ τοῦ κακῶς φρονεῖν τοῖς ἀνοήτοις γίγνεται, ὡς Δημοσθένης εἶπεν, ἀλλὰ τὸ εὐτυχεῖν παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἀφορμὴ τοῦ κακῶς πράττειν τοῖς μὴ φρονοῦσιν.	For not only is it true, as Demosthenes has said, that undeserved success becomes a source of misconception for fools, but undeserved good fortune also becomes a source of misery for the unthinking.
Μαθηταὶ δ’ αὐτοῦ Σπεύσιππος Ἀθηναῖος, Ξενοκράτης Καλχηδόνιος, Ἀριστοτέλης Σταγειρίτης, Φίλιππος Ὀπούντιος, Ἑστιαῖος Περίνθιος, Δίων Συρακόσιος, Ἄμυκλος Ἡρακλεώτης, Ἔραστος καὶ Κορίσκος Σκήψιοι, Τιμόλαος Κυζικηνός, Εὐαίων Λαμψακηνός, Πύθων καὶ Ἡρακλείδης Αἴνιοι, Ἱπποθάλης καὶ Κάλλιππος Ἀθηναῖοι, Δημήτριος Ἀμφιπολίτης, Ἡρακλείδης Ποντικὸς καὶ ἄλλοι πλείους, σὺν οἷς καὶ γυναῖκες δύο Λασθένεια Μαντινικὴ καὶ Ἀξιοθέα Φλειασία ἣ καὶ ἀνδρεῖα ἠμπίσχετο, ὥς φησι Δικαίαρχος.	His disciples were Speusippus of Athens, Xenocrates of Chalcedon, Aristotle of Stagira, Philippus of Opus, Hestiaeus of Perinthus, Dion of Syracuse, Amyclus of Heraclea, Erastus and Coriscus of Scepsus, Timolaus of Cyzicus, Euaeon of Lampsacus, Python and Heraclides of Aenus, Hippothales and Callippus of Athens, Demetrius of Amphipolis, Heraclides of Pontus, and many others, among them two women, Lastheneia of Mantinea and Axiothea of Phlius, who is reported by Dicaearchus to have worn men’s clothes.
ἄδηλοι δέ, ὅταν κατὰ τοὺς λίθους, τὰ ὄρη, τὰ φελλία, τὰ δασέα ἀποχωρῶσι, διὰ τὴν ὁμόχροιαν.	But when their line of retreat is amongst stones, in the mountains, over rocky or thickly wooded ground they cannot be seen owing to the similarity of colouring.
ὃς δὲ πρῶτος ἐξεῦρεν τὸ πρῲ ’πιπίνειν; Β. πολλήν γε λακκοπρωκτίαν ἡμῖν ἐπίστασ’ εὑρών. ΑΛΚ.	But Eupolis attacks the man who first mentioned such a thing, saying— I hate the ways of Sparta's line, And would rather fry my dinner
διὸ καὶ δῆλον ἐκ τῆς τοιαύτης ἐπαγωγῆς ὅτι τῆς οὐσίας καὶ τοῦ τί ἐστιν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπόδειξις.	hence it is obvious from such a process of induction that there is no demonstration of the reality or essence.
ἃ ἔπη Ἐρατοσθένης οὕτω γεγράφθαι φησίν·	lines which Eratosthenes says ought to stand thus
εἶτα τὸ στωίδιον οἰκοδομηθῆναι τὸ πρὸς τῷ μουσείῳ μὴ χεῖρον ἢ πρότερον· ἀναθεῖναι δὲ καὶ τοὺς πίνακας, ἐν οἷς αἱ τῆς γῆς περίοδοί εἰσιν, εἰς τὴν κάτω στοάν·	Next, to rebuild the small cloister adjoining the Museum at least as handsomely as before, and to replace in the lower cloister the tablets containing maps of the countries traversed by explorers.
ἐς ταύτην φθαρέντος τοῦ ναυτικοῦ τοῦ Μήδων κατήνεγκεν ὁ κλύδων τὰ ναυάγια.	on to it, when the Persian fleet was destroyed, the wrecks were carried down by the waves.
Τοῦτο δὲ πρὸς τὸ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν συμφέρον λέγω· οὐχ ἵνα βρόχον ὑμῖν ἐπιβάλω, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸ εὔσχημον καὶ εὐπρόσεδρον τῷ κυρίῳ ἀπερισπάστως.	And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.
αὗται τοσαῦται καὶ τοιαῦται αἱ ἁμαρτάδες καὶ ἄγνοιαι τῆς φύσιος τῆς χειρός.	Such, and so many mistakes and marks of ignorance are committed, regarding the natural construction of the arm.
μὴ πέσῃ πράως ὑφῆκε, παρέχων ἐκείνῳ τὴν ἀπόκλισιν ἄλυπον.	and then fearing lest the king should fall, he stooped down gently, to ease the king in sliding to the ground.
διαβάλλοντος δὲ καὶ τὰς βασάνους εἰς ψευδολογίαν, ὡς τῆς ἀνάγκης φύσιν ἐχούσης διδάσκειν τοὺς ὑποπεσόντας τὰ πολλὰ ἡδονῇ τῶν ἐφεστηκότων λέγειν, καὶ παρέχοντος αὑτὸν εἰς βάσανον,	He denounced the lies people had told under torture, under the pain of which people are forced to say whatever will please those in power, and he even offered himself to be put to the torture.
ὁ δέ, εἴτε καὶ διὰ τὸ ἐπιβόημα εἴτε καὶ αὐτῷ ἄλλο τι ἢ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ δόξαν ἐξαίφνης, πάλιν τὸ στράτευμα κατὰ τάχος πρὶν ξυμμεῖξαι ἀπῆγεν. καὶ ἀφικόμενος πρὸς τὴν Τεγεᾶτιν τὸ ὕδωρ ἐξέτρεπεν ἐς τὴν Μαντινικήν, περὶ οὗπερ ὡς τὰ πολλὰ βλάπτοντος ὁποτέρωσε ἂν ἐσπίπτῃ Μαντινῆς καὶ Τεγεᾶται πολεμοῦσιν.	Meanwhile Agis, whether in consequence of this halloo or of some sudden new idea of his own, quickly led back his army without engaging, and entering the Tegean territory, began to turn off into that of Mantinea the water about which the Mantineans and Tegeans are always fighting, on account of the extensive damage it does to whichever of the two countries if falls into.
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδ’ ἔστι γε αὐτῷ τι τῶν ὄντων· ἤδη γὰρ ἂν τούτου μετέχον οὐσίας μετέχοι.	Ceph. Nor can anything which exists pertain to it for the moment it partook of anything which exists it would partake of existence.
ἔτι δὲ ταῦτα πάντα ἢ τῷ μόνον ἂν συμβῆναι γενέσθαι ἢ μὴ γενέσθαι, ἢ τῷ καλῶς.	(e) All these things are "potent" either because they merely might chance to happen or not to happen, or because they might do so well .
καὶ ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀνέβαινον ἑπτὰ βόες καλαὶ τῷ εἴδει καὶ ἐκλεκταὶ ταῖς σαρξίν, καὶ ἐνέμοντο ἐν τῷ ἄχει·	And it was like, from the river seven cows were going up, beautiful in form and choice in flesh parts, and they were grazing in the herbage.
οὗτος δ’, ὃν ἠνάγκασεν αὑτῷ πατέρα γενέσθαι, τοῦτον οὐκ αἰσχύνεται ψέγων ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, ἀλλ’ εἰς τοῦτο ἀμαθίας ἥκει, ὥστε τῶν νόμων ἀπαγορευόντων μηδὲ τοὺς τῶν ἄλλων πατέρας κακῶς λέγειν τεθνεῶτας, οὗτος, οὗ φησιν υἱὸς εἶναι, τοῦτον λοιδορήσει, ᾧ προσῆκεν καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος ἐβλασφήμει περὶ αὐτοῦ ἀγανακτεῖν.	But Boeotus feels no shame in disparaging before you the man whom he compelled to become his father, and has even come to such a pitch of vulgarity that, although the laws forbid speaking ill even of other men’s fathers after they are dead, he will slander the man whose son he claims to be whereas it would be proper for him to show resentment if anyone else spoke evil of him.
ἡ δὲ τρυφερωτέρα θρίδαξ εὐστομαχωτέρα καὶ μᾶλλον ὕπνον ποιοῦσα.	But the softer lettuce is still better for the stomach, and still more soporific
καὶ γὰρ ὁ μὴ ῥηθεὶς λόγος τοῖς ὧδ’ ἔχουσιν αἰτίαν ἂν παράσχοι ὡς, εἰ ἐλέχθη, σωτήριος ἂν ἦν.	placed as we are, we could scarcely be silent without being tormented by the damning thought that speaking might have saved us.
’ αὕτη ἡ τοῦ λαμπροτάτου βασιλέως φωνή, ὃς οὐδὲ φασιανικοῦ ὄρνιθός ποτε γεύσασθαι ὡμολόγησεν, ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ τι κειμήλιον ἀνακείμενον εἶχε τούσδε τοὺς ὄρνιθας.	Now this is the expression of a most magnificent monarch, who confesses that he himself has never tasted a pheasant, but who used to keep these birds as a sort of treasure.
ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσας οἴκαδε ἀπεχώρησε. μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα προθύμων ὄντων τῶν Ἀχαιῶν εἰς τὴν συμμαχίαν καὶ δεομένων συστρατεύειν αὐτοῖς εἰς Ἀκαρνανίαν καὶ ἐπιθεμένων ἐν στενοῖς τῶν Ἀκαρνάνων καταλαβὼν τὰ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν μάχην συνάπτει καὶ πολλοὺς ἀποκτείνας αὐτῶν τρόπαιον ἐστήσατο, καὶ οὐ πρότερον ἔληξε πρὶν Ἀχαιοῖς μὲν φίλους ἐποίησεν Ἀκαρνᾶνας καὶ Αἰτωλοὺς καὶ Ἀργείους, ἑαυτῷ δὲ καὶ συμμάχους.	After these events, the Achaeans, who were zealous advocates of the alliance, begged him to join them in an expedition against Acarnania. And when the Acarnanians attacked him in a mountain pass he seized the heights above their heads with his light infantry, fought an engagement and, after inflicting severe losses on them, set up a trophy nor did he cease until he had induced the Acarnanians, Aetolians and Argives to enter into friendship with the Achaeans and alliance with himself.
καὶ τριάκοντα λαμπάδας ἔχοντες ἐπέμφθησαν.	So thirty men were sent, with torches.
ὃς κατιδὼν τό τε τοῦ βασιλέως ὀξύρροπον καὶ τὴν Ἀρχελάου φιλίαν παρ’ αὐτῷ πάντων κρατοῦσαν, ὡς οὐκ ἐνῆν εὐσχήμονι σωτηρία, τὴν δι’ ἀναιδείας ἐπορίζετο·	who perceiving that the king's inclinations changed on a sudden, and that Archelaus's friendship could do every thing with him, and that he had no honorable method of preserving himself, he procured his safety by his impudence.
λέγουσι δὲ αὐτόν τινες ἐκ Διὸς γενέσθαι.	But some say that he was a son of Zeus.
σφάξαι σ’ Ἀργείων κοινὰ συντείνει πρὸς τύμβον γνώμα Πηλείᾳ γέννᾳ.	The Argives with one consent are eager for your sacrifice to the son of Peleus at his tomb.
τῶν δὲ δέκα πρέσβεων ἐκ Ῥώμης ἀφικομένων Μακεδόσι μὲν ἀπέδωκε τὴν χώραν καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἐλευθέρας οἰκεῖν καὶ αὐτονόμους, ἑκατὸν δὲ τάλαντα Ῥωμαίοις ὑποτελεῖν, οὗ πλέον ἢ διπλάσιον τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν εἰσέφερον.	When the ten commissioners arrived from Rome, he restored to the Macedonians their country and their cities for free and independent residence they were also to pay the Romans a hundred talents in tribute, a sum less than half of what they used to pay to their kings.
τὰ μὲν τοίνυν λογισμῶν τε καὶ γεωμετριῶν καὶ πάσης τῆς προπαιδείας, ἣν τῆς διαλεκτικῆς δεῖ προπαιδευθῆναι, παισὶν οὖσι χρὴ προβάλλειν, οὐχ ὡς ἐπάναγκες μαθεῖν τὸ σχῆμα τῆς διδαχῆς ποιουμένους. τί δή; ὅτι, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, οὐδὲν μάθημα μετὰ δουλείας τὸν ἐλεύθερον χρὴ μανθάνειν.	“Now, all this study of reckoning and geometry and all the preliminary studies that are indispensable preparation for dialectics must be presented to them while still young, not in the form of compulsory instruction.” “Why so?” Because, said I, “a free soul ought not to pursue any study slavishly
πλοῦτος τὸ τῆς οἰκονομικῆς τέλος ἐστίν.	Wealth is the goal of managing one's affairs.
ἔστι δὴ μεμαρτυρημένον αὐτοῖς προκαλεῖσθαι Φορμίων’ ἀνοίγειν τὰς διαθήκας, ἃς παρέχειν πρὸς τὸν διαιτητὴν Τεισίαν Ἀμφίαν τὸν Κηφισοφῶντος κηδεστήν·	Well, then, it is deposed by them that Phormio challenged me to open the will which Amphias, brother—in—law of Cephisophon, submitted to the arbitrator Teisias
δὸς δέ μοι πίστεις ἐνόρκους μή μου τὸ γένος ἐξαφανίσαι μηδ’ ἐμοὶ μνησικακοῦντα τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐγγόνους ἀπολέσαι, τηρῆσαι δέ μοι καὶ σῶσαι τὸν οἶκον.	Give me then assurances upon oath, That thou wilt not root out my family, nor, out of remembrance of what evil I have done thee, destroy my posterity, but save and preserve my house."
τὴν δ’ αἰτίαν , καὶ πῶς ἑκατέρῳ χρηστέον, ἐροῦμεν ὕστερον·	Their origin and the way in which each should be used will be discussed later
τί δέ; τὸ καὶ ἀηδῶς καὶ μὴ συμφερόντως αὑτῷ;	Well, would you admit the epithets unpleasant and unprofitable to himself?
καὶ οἱ μὲν ἄραντες τῇ παρασκευῇ ταύτῃ περιέπλεον, οἱ δὲ Πελοποννήσιοι χρόνον ἐμμείναντες ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὅσου εἶχον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἀνεχώρησαν διὰ Βοιωτῶν, οὐχ ᾗπερ ἐσέβαλον·	This armament weighed anchor and started on its cruise, and the Peloponnesians, after remaining in Attica as long as their provisions lasted, retired through Boeotia by a different road to that by which they had entered.
ἀγανακτοῦντος δὲ τάνθρώπου, γελάσας ὁ Παύσων κατέστρεψε τὸν πίνακα·	at which when the person that had agreed with him seemed to be not a little displeased, Pauson fell a laughing, and turned the picture upside downward
ἔστρεψεν τὸν αὑτοῦ δοῦλον ἐπὶ στρατηγοῦ.	He has turned round his own slave before the praetor.
καὶ οἱ τοιοῦτοι οὔτε ναῦς πληροῦντες οὔτε πεζὰς στρατιὰς πολλάκις ἐκπέμπειν δύνανται, ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων τε ἅμα ἀπόντες καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν αὑτῶν δαπανῶντες καὶ προσέτι καὶ θαλάσσης εἰργόμενοι·	And such men can neither man their fleets nor yet send out their armies by land very often, because they must be far from their own wealth and yet by that be maintained and be besides barred the use of the sea.
πρός τε τὸν εἰπόντα, εἰ τὰ ἐν Λαμψάκῳ ὄρη ἔσται ποτὲ θάλαττα, φασὶν εἰπεῖν, ἐάν γε ὁ χρόνος μὴ ἐπιλίπῃ.	When some one asked him if the hills at Lampsacus would ever become sea, he replied, Yes, it only needs time.
ἢ ἐὰν μὴ ταὐτὸν ᾖ μηδ’ ἕτερον, μέρος ἂν εἴη τούτου πρὸς ὃ οὕτως ἔχει, ἢ ὡς πρὸς μέρος ὅλον ἂν εἴη.	or if neither the same or other, its relation is that of a part to a whole or of a whole to a part.
ταῖς δὲ δαπάναις ὑπὲρ δύναμιν χρώμενος ἠναγκάζετο χαλεπὸς εἶναι τοῖς ὑποτεταγμένοις·	and as his expenses were beyond his abilities, he was necessitated to be harsh to his subjects
ὁ δὲ ἤδη μετὰ χρημάτων ἄλλων τήν τε Ῥάβενναν καὶ τὰ ἀγχοῦ πάντα περιῄει, στρατεύων ἑτέρους ἐφ’ ἑτέροις· καὶ πάντας ἐς Ἀρρήτιον ἔπεμπεν.	Octavius had already proceeded with new supplies of money to Ravenna and the neighboring parts, enlisting new forces continually and sending them all to Arretium.
καὶ ἤδη τε ἦν μέσον ἡμέρας καὶ οὔπω καταφανεῖς ἦσαν οἱ πολέμιοι·	And now it was midday, and the enemy were not yet in sight
Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ πάντες σκανδαλισθήσονται ἐν σοί, ἐγὼ οὐδέποτε σκανδαλισθήσομαι.¶	Peter said to him, "If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!"
καὶ τἆλλά τε πάντα μετέβαλλε, ἀπομιμούμενα καὶ συνακολουθοῦντα τῷ τοῦ παντὸς παθήματι, καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸ τῆς κυήσεως καὶ γεννήσεως καὶ τροφῆς μίμημα συνείπετο τοῖς πᾶσιν ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης·	And all other things changed, imitating the condition of the universe and conforming to it, and so too pregnancy and birth and nurture necessarily imitated and conformed to the rest
τί οὖν κωλύει καὶ ἐνταῦθα ὁμοίως;	What then hinders the same being done in this case also?
καὶ ζητούντων πάντων αὐτός, ἔφη, ἐγὼ ἐρῶ, Φύλαρχος ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ἢ Ναυκρατίτης ἐν οἷς ὁ λόγος ἐστὶν αὐτῷ περὶ Ζηλᾶ τοῦ Βιθυνῶν βασιλέως, ὃς ἐπὶ ξένια καλέσας τοὺς τῶν Γαλατῶν ἡγεμόνας ἐπιβουλεύσας αὐτοῖς καὶ αὐτὸς διεφθάρη, φησὶν οὕτως, εἰ μνήμης εὐτυχῶ· πρόπομά τι πρὸ τοῦ δείπνου περιεφέρετο, καθὼς εἰώθει τὸ πρῶτον.	and when every one joined in the question, I will tell you, said Athenæus Phylarchus the Athenian, (though some called him a native of Naucratis,) in the book where he speaks of Zelas the king of the Bithynians, who invited to supper all the leaders of the Galatians, and then plotted against them, and was killed himself also, says, if I recollect his words rightly, 'A certain πρόπομα was brought round before supper, as was the custom of antiquity.'
οὐ χρὴ δὲ θαυμάζειν τὴν ἀκρίβειαν τῆς ἀναγραφῆς, εἰ τοιαύτῃ κεχρήμεθα περὶ τῶν ὑπ’ Ἀννίβου κατ’ Ἰβηρίαν πεπραγμένων οἵᾳ μόλις ἂν χρήσαιτό τις αὐτὸς κεχειρικὼς τὰς κατὰ μέρος πράξεις, οὐδὲ προκαταγινώσκειν, εἰ πεποιήκαμεν παραπλήσιον τοῖς ἀξιοπίστως ψευδομένοις τῶν συγγραφέων.	The accuracy of this enumeration of Hannibal's Iberian establishment need excite no surprise, though it is such as a commander himself would have some difficulty in displaying nor ought I to be condemned at once of imitating the specious falsehoods of historians
ἐπὶ τῷ ἐμῷ ῥήματι οὐ προσέθεντο, περιχαρεῖς δὲ ἐγίνοντο ὁπόταν αὐτοῖς ἐλάλουν·	At my word they did not continue, and they became exceedingly glad whenever I spoke to them.
λοιπὸν ὅσον ἂν τὸ μετὰ ταύτην μέρος ἀνατεταλκὸς φαίνηται τοῦ ζῳδιακοῦ, τοσοῦτον εἰκὸς ἠνύσθαι τῆς νυκτὸς αἰεί.	Therefore the length of the night is exactly commensurate with the portion of the Zodiac which appears above the horizon after sunset.
ἆρά γε τοῦτο τοῖς λεπροῖς ὄνομα θέμενος ἢ μόνον τῶν Ἰουδαίων τοῖς νοσήμασι περιπεσόντων;	Now it is uncertain whether he ascribes this name to these lepers, or to those that were subject to such diseases among the Jews only
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδ’ ἐκεῖνο ποιεῖν οὐδεὶς ἄν μοι συμβουλεύσειεν, ἀμελήσαντι τούτων καὶ μεταξὺ καταβαλόντι περαίνειν τὸν λόγον, ὃν προῄρημαι βουλόμενος ἐπιδεῖξαι τὴν πόλιν ἡμῶν πλειόνων ἀγαθῶν αἰτίαν γεγενημένην τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἢ τὴν Λακεδαιμονίων·	But neither would anyone, I am sure, advise me to neglect this subject and, breaking off in the midst of it, to go on and finish the discourse which I elected to write in my desire to prove that our city had been the cause of more blessings to the Hellenes than the city of the Lacedaemonians.
τὴν δ’ αἰτίαν μετ’ οὐ πολὺ δηλώσομεν·	the occasion whereof we shall declare in a little time
ἐν δὲ μέσοις ἁγνὴν ὀδμὴν λιβανωτὸς ἵησι·	And in the midst the frankincense sends forth Its holy perfume
καὶ περὶ ἑτέρων δὲ αὖθις τῶν κατ’ αὐτοὺς τετιμημένων ὡς δὴ μαρτύρων οὕτω γράφει ἵνα δὲ μὴ περὶ πλειόνων λέγωμεν, ἡ προφῆτις ἡμῖν εἰπάτω τὰ κατὰ Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν λέγοντα ἑαυτὸν μάρτυρα, ᾧ συνεστιᾶται, ᾧ προσκυνοῦσι καὶ αὐτῷ πολλοὶ, οὗ τὰς λῃστείας καὶ τὰ ἄλλα τολμή μάτα, ἐφ’ οἶς κεκόλασται, οὐχ ἡμὰς δεῖ λέγειν, ἀλλὰ ὁ ὀπισθόδομος ἔχει.	On the other martyrdoms which Dionysius relates. XLIII. Οn Novatus, his manner of life, and his heresy. XLIV.
πάνυ, ἔφην ἐγώ, καλῶς τε καὶ ὀρθῶς.	Very finely and correctly, I replied.
τὰ δὲ τοιαῦτα τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων οὐδ’ ἀπολογίαν ἐπιδέχεται·	Such blunders admit of no defence
τὴν μὲν οὖν παρασκευὴν καὶ τὴν προθυμίαν τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὁρᾶτε, καὶ οὐδὲν δεῖ περὶ τούτων λέγειν·	You see, of course, the artifice and the alacrity of my enemies of these there is no need to speak
” ἐν ταὐτῷ δὲ καὶ τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς φιλοσοφίας ἐπὶ τὴν θεοσέβειαν μεταβολὴν αὐτοῦ , ὅτι μὴ ἀλόγως, μετὰ κρίσεως δ’ αὐτῷ γεγόνει δηλῶν ταῦτα γράφει “ καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἐγὼ τοῖς Πλάτωνος χαίρων διδάγμασι, ’ διαβαλλομένους ἀκούων Χριστιανοὺς , ὁρῶν δὲ καὶ “ἀφόβους πρὸς θάνατον καὶ πάντα τὰ νομιζόμενα φοβερὰ, ἐνενόουν ἀδύνατον εἶναι ἐν κακίᾳ καὶ φι ’ ληδονίᾳ ὑπάρχειν αὐτούς.	for he writes thus “For I myself, while I was rejoicing in the teaching of Plato, heard the Christians abused. But 1 saw that they were afraid neither of death, nor οf anything usually thought feadul, and I considered it was impossible that they were living in wickedness and liberinism.
τὸ δὲ δὴ περὶ τοῦ κυριωτάτου παρ’ ἡμῖν ψυχῆς εἴδους διανοεῖσθαι δεῖ τῇδε, ὡς ἄρα αὐτὸ δαίμονα θεὸς ἑκάστῳ δέδωκεν, τοῦτο ὃ δή φαμεν οἰκεῖν μὲν ἡμῶν ἐπ’ ἄκρῳ τῷ σώματι, πρὸς δὲ τὴν ἐν οὐρανῷ συγγένειαν ἀπὸ γῆς ἡμᾶς αἴρειν ὡς ὄντας φυτὸν οὐκ ἔγγειον ἀλλὰ οὐράνιον, ὀρθότατα λέγοντες·	And as regards the most lordly kind of our soul, we must conceive of it in this wise we declare that God has given to each of us, as his daemon, that kind of soul which is housed in the top of our body and which raises us—seeing that we are not an earthly but a heavenly plant up from earth towards our kindred in the heaven. And herein we speak most truly
πλὴν ἔστι γε τὰ βασίλεια τῷ μὲν μεγέθει σχεδὸν ἑπτὰ σταδίων ἔχοντα τὴν περιγραφήν, τῇ δὲ τῶν κατὰ μέρος κατασκευασμάτων πολυτελείᾳ μεγάλην ἐμφαίνοντα τὴν τῶν ἐξ ἀρχῆς καταβαλλομένων εὐκαιρίαν.	However, as regards size, the palace covers ground the circuit of which is nearly seven stades and by the costliness of the structure in its several parts it testifies to the wealth of its original builders
ἐμήνυε δὲ καὶ τοῦτο, ἀνίστα“σθαι ἔωθεν τοὺς Χριστιανοὺς καὶ τὸν Χριστὸν “θεοῦ δίκην ὑμνεῖν, καὶ πρὸς τὸ τὴν ἐπιστήμην αὐ“τῶν διαφυλάσσειν κωλύεσθαι φονεύειν, μοιχεύειν, “πλεονεκτεῖν, ἀποστερεῖν καὶ τὰ τούτοις ὅμοια.	Ηe also mentioned this that the Christians arose at dawn and sang a hymn to Christ as a God, and in order to preserve their teaching 1 forbade murder, adultery, covetousness, robbery, and suchlike.
τὸ δὴ μετὰ τοῦτο ἡ πάλαι ἐπιβουλὴ Διονυσίῳ τοῦ μὴ ἀποδοῦναι τὰ Δίωνος χρήματα ἔδοξεν ἔχθρας λόγον ἔχειν ἂν πρός με πιθανόν, καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἐκ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως ἐκπέμπει με, εὑρὼν πρόφασιν ὡς τὰς γυναῖκας ἐν τῷ κήπῳ, ἐν ᾧ κατῴκουν ἐγώ, δέοι θῦσαι θυσίαν τινὰ δεχήμερον·	Now after this Dionysius decided that his previous plot of refusing to pay over Dion’s money would furnish him with a plausible ground for a quarrel with me and, as a first step, he sent me out of the citadel, inventing the excuse that the women had to perform a sacrifice of ten days’ duration in the garden where I was lodging
τοῖς δ’ ὀνόμασι τούτοις ἄλλως κέχρηνται κοινοῖς οὖσιν, ὥσπερ οἱ νομικοὶ Γάιον Σήιον καὶ Λούκιον Τίτιον, καὶ οἱ φιλόσοφοι Δίωνα καὶ Θέωνα παραλαμβάνουσιν.	These names are in common use also in other connexions, just as jurists speak of Gaius Seius and Lucius Titius, and philosophers of Dion and Theon.
ἐκλαβὼν γὰρ ὡς ἔοικεν ἵππον ἀλινδούμενον γράψαι τρέχοντ’ ἔγραψεν.	He, having contracted to paint a horse wallowing upon his back, drew the horse galloping at full speed
Καὶ πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα, ὤφθη αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ ὄρους Σινᾶ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐν φλογὶ πυρὸς βάτου.	"And when forty years had passed, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.
ἡ τύχη δ’ αἰτία κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς ἐν τοῖς κατὰ προαίρεσιν τῶν ἕνεκά του γιγνομένοις, διὸ περὶ ταὐτὰ τύχη καὶ διάνοια· προαίρεσις γὰρ οὐ χωρὶς διανοίας.	Chance is an accidental cause of normally purposive teleological events. Hence chance and thought have the same sphere of action, for there is no purpose without thought.
ἅμα δ’ οἱ μὲν ἰατροὶ τοῦ Σώσιδος τὸ τραῦμα καταμανθάνοντες εὕρισκον ἐξ ἐπιπολῆς μᾶλλον ἢ καταφορᾶς γεγενημένον.	At the same time, too, the physicians examined the wound of Sosis and discovered that it had been made by razure rather than by a downright blow.
Περὶ δὲ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν, ἀδελφοί, οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ὑμῖν γράφεσθαι.	But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you.
ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἀριθμὸς ἐξ ἀδιαιρέτων σύγκειται τὰ δὲ μεγέθη οὔ.	because although number is composed of indivisible parts, spatial magnitudes are not.
ἴσως δὲ ἀρετῆς ἵστορα τὴν θεὸν ἐκάλεσεν ὁ καλέσας, τάχα δ’ ἂν καὶ ὡς τὸν ἄροτον μισησάσης τὸν ἀνδρὸς ἐν γυναικί·	or perhaps he who named her meant that she is learned in virtue (ἀρετή), or possibly, too, that she hates sexual intercourse (ἄροτον μισεῖ) of man and woman
ἡ οὖν Μαριὰμ λαβοῦσα λίτραν μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτίμου ἤλειψεν τοὺς πόδας τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἐξέμαξεν ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ· ἡ δὲ οἰκία ἐπληρώθη ἐκ τῆς ὀσμῆς τοῦ μύρου.	Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair. (Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.)
οἷσι δ’ ἂν μὴ ἐμβληθῇ, μηδὲ πειρηθῇ ἐμβάλλεσθαι, οὗτοι πολὺ πλείονες περιγίνονται·	But in those cases in which they are not reduced, nor any attempt made to reduce them, the patients, for the most part, recover
εἰ οὖν ὅν τ’ ἂν ᾖ χρόνον καὶ ὃν ἂν μὴ ᾖ ἄνθρωπος, ἐνέσονται αὐτῷ ἀληθεῖς δόξαι, αἳ ἐρωτήσει ἐπεγερθεῖσαι ἐπιστῆμαι γίγνονται, ἆρ’ οὖν τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον μεμαθηκυῖα ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ;	So if in both of these periods—when he was and was not a human being—he has had true opinions in him which have only to be awakened by questioning to become knowledge, his soul must have had this cognizance throughout all time?
φημὶ δὲ καὶ εἰς πόλιν ὅπῃ βούλει ἐλθόντα ῥητορικὸν ἄνδρα καὶ ἰατρόν, εἰ δέοι λόγῳ διαγωνίζεσθαι ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ ἢ ἐν ἄλλῳ τινὶ συλλόγῳ ὁπότερον δεῖ αἱρεθῆναι ἰατρόν, οὐδαμοῦ ἂν φανῆναι τὸν ἰατρόν, ἀλλ’ αἱρεθῆναι ἂν τὸν εἰπεῖν δυνατόν, εἰ βούλοιτο.	And I further declare that, if a rhetorician and a doctor were to enter any city you please, and there had to contend in speech before the Assembly or some other meeting as to which of the two should be appointed physician, you would find the physician was nowhere, while the master of speech would be appointed if he wished.
οἱ δέ, πρίν τι γενέσθαι παράγγελμα, νυκτὸς ἔτι, σπουδῇ τὰ ἴδια ἕκαστος ἐξέπεμπεν ἐκ τοῦ στρατοπέδου· καὶ ὠθουμένων περὶ τὰς πύλας σκευοφόρων πολὺ πλῆθος ἦν.	They did not wait for the signal to be given, but while it was still night each one sent his own baggage out of the camp, which made a great crush of pack animals around the gates.
δύο δὲ κεκτημένον ἐν αὑτῷ συμβούλω ἐναντίω τε καὶ ἄφρονε, ὣ προσαγορεύομεν ἡδονὴν καὶ λύπην;	And that each possesses within himself two antagonistic and foolish counsellors, whom we call by the names of pleasure and pain?
Καὶ ὁ μὲν ἐπαύσατο τῶν εὐχῶν: θρηνούντων δὲ πάντων, ὅσοι πρὸς αὐτὸν σὺν γυναιξὶν καὶ τέκνοις συνῆλθον, Ἀχόνιός τις ὀνόματι πρῶτος τῶν Ἱεροσολυμιτῶν, προσελθὼν αὐτοὺς μὲν ἁμαρτεῖν ἔλεγεν ἀλλοεθνεῖς ἐνοικισαμένους γυναῖκας, ἔπειθε δ' αὐτὸν ἐξορκίσαι πάντας ἐκβαλεῖν αὐτὰς καὶ τὰ ἐξ αὐτῶν γεγενημένα, κολασθήσεσθαι δὲ τοὺς οὐχ ὑπακούσαντας τῷ νόμῳ.	With this he ceased his prayer and when all those who came to him with their wives and children joined in lamentation, a leading person from Jerusalem named Achonias came to him saying that they had sinned in marrying foreign wives, and he persuaded him to get them all to expel those wives and the children born of them and to punish any who would not obey the law.
ἑσπέρα μὲν γὰρ ἦν, ἧκε δ’ ἀγγέλλων τις ὡς τοὺς πρυτάνεις ὡς Ἐλάτεια κατείληπται.	Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding councillors the news that Elatea had been taken.
φεῦ δᾶ τὸν ὅρκον ἄφατον ὡς ἐπαινίω.	ah, what aith could clink pleasanter than that!
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις οὕτως ἰδίοις οὖσι καὶ περιττοῖς κἀκεῖνο λέγεις, ὡς τῶν μὲν ἀρχῶν καὶ τῶν ὠφελιῶν τῶν ἐντεῦθεν γιγνομένων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων τῶν κοινῶν ἐξέστηκας, εἰς δὲ τοὺς διακοσίους καὶ χιλίους τοὺς εἰσφέροντας καὶ λειτουργοῦντας οὐ μόνον αὑτὸν παρέχεις ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν υἱόν, καὶ τρὶς μὲν ἤδη τετριηραρχήκατε, τὰς δ’ ἄλλας λειτουργίας πολυτελέστερον λελειτουργήκατε καὶ κάλλιον ὧν οἱ νόμοι προστάττουσι.	And to these peculiarities and idiosyncrasies you add another, namely, that you have held aloof from the public offices and the emoluments which go with them, and from all other privileges of the commonwealth as well, while you have enrolled not only yourself but your son among the twelve hundred who pay the war-taxes and bear the liturgies, and you and he have three times discharged the trierarchy, besides having performed the other services more generously and handsomely than the laws require.
τούτου δὲ Δημήτριος, ὃς αὐτός τε βασιλεύσας χρόνον οὐ πολύν, υἱόν τε παῖδα τὴν ἡλικίαν ἀπολιπὼν Φίλιππον ἐτελεύτησε.	His son in turn was Demetrius, who, after reigning himself for a short time, died, leaving a son Philip still in his boyhood.
Βωκωνίῳ δ’ ἀπαντήσας ἄγοντι μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ τρεῖς ἀμορφοτάτας θυγατέρας ἀνεφθέγξατο·	And when he met Voconius escorting three very ugly daughters, he cried out
καὶ τὴν στεφάνην καὶ τὰς φιάλας καὶ τὰς κρεάγρας καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χαλκᾶ ἐν οἷς ἐλειτούργουν ἐν αὐτοῖς,	And the chief took the rim and the bowls and the flesh-hooks and all the bronze vessels with which they ministered,
ἢν οὖν ἡ διπλόη λυθῇ, ὁ μὲν ἐντὸς χιτὼν ἀποστὰς ἐς μῆκος ἔξω χωρέει, ὁ δὲ ἐκτὸς μίμνει μοῦνος, καὶ σαρκοῦται, καὶ ἐπωτειλοῦται, καὶ ἀλθέξονται , καὶ ζώωσι ἀσινέες.	when, therefore, the connection between them is dissolved, the inner coat, being separated to some length, protrudes externally, while the outer one remains alone, incarnates, and gets cicatrised, and the patients recover and live unharmed.
τοῖς μὲν οὖν σοῖς ἑταίροις ἐμοῖς δ’ υἱοῖς ἐδόκει λελυκέναι τὴν ἀπορίαν Ἀριστοτέλης· καὶ οὐδὲν ᾤοντο δεῖν ζητεῖν οὐδὲ λέγειν ἀλλ’ ἢ τοὺς καρπούς, ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνος, αἰτιᾶσθαι.	Your friends and my sons thought Aristotle had given sufficient satisfaction in this point, and that no other cause was to be sought after or allowed but that which he mentions, the fruit.
ὦ μέγα σεμναὶ Νεφέλαι φανερῶς ἠκούσατέ μου καλέσαντος.	O ye greatly venerable Clouds, ye have clearly heard me when I called.
οἱ δ’ ἐν ἡλικίᾳ τῶν πατρικίων, ὅ τι περ ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει μάλιστα γαυρούμενον εὐγενείᾳ καὶ ἀνθοῦν, ἀεί τε θαυμαστῶς ἐσπουδάκεσαν περὶ τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ τότε προσκείμενοι καὶ παρόντες οὐκ ἐπ’ ἀγαθῷ τὸν θυμὸν ἐξερρίπιζον αὐτοῦ τῷ συναγανακτεῖν καὶ συναλγεῖν.	The younger patricians, too, that element in the city which made most vaunt of noble birth and was most showy, had always been amazingly devoted to the man, and, adhering to him now, when their presence did him no good, fanned his anger by their sympathetic vexation and sorrow.
Ἀποσκευάσαισθε δ' ἂν τὴν αἰτίαν τῆς ἀποστάσεως, εἰ ταύτας τε συνάψετε πάλιν καὶ τελέσετε τὴν εἰσφοράν: οὐ γὰρ δή γε Φλώρου τὸ φρούριόν ἐστιν ἢ Φλώρῳ τὰ χρήματα δώσετε."	You can end the revolt by joining these again and paying your tax. Remember, the fortress does not belong to Florus, nor is it to Florus that your tax money will go."
ταῦτα δὲ θεασάμενοι τῶν Ἱεροσολυμιτῶν οἱ προύχοντες δεινῶς ἐχαλέπαινον·	which thing, when the chief men of Jerusalem saw they were very much displeased at it
παραχρῆμα οὖν ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Πηλούσιον καὶ ἐκράτησεν τῆς ἰδίας βασιλείας.	he therefore returned back to Pelusium immediately, and recovered his kingdom again.
ἀφορίζει γὰρ αὐτῶν ὁ ποιητὴς χρόνους, πρόσωπα, αἰτίας, τοῦτο δὲ ὀρθῶς ἀπεμάξατο ὁ Ξενοφῶν καὶ Πλάτων, οἳ κατ’ ἀρχὰς τῶν ξυγγραμμάτων ἐκτίθενται τὴν αἰτίαν τοῦ συμποσίου καὶ τίνες οἱ παρόντες.	For the poet gives us the different times of them, and the persons present, and the causes of them. And Xenophon and Plato have done well to imitate him in this who at the very beginning of their treatises set forth the cause which gave rise to the banquet, and mention the names of those who were present.
ὅλως δὲ ὧν ἡ νόησις ἀδιαίρετος ἡ νοοῦσα τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι, καὶ μὴ δύναται χωρίσαι μήτε χρόνῳ μήτε τόπῳ μήτε λόγῳ, μάλιστα ταῦτα ἕν, καὶ τούτων ὅσα οὐσίαι·	And in general those things whose concept, which conceives the essence, is indistinguishable and cannot be separated either in time or in place or in definition, are in the truest sense one and of these such as are substances are most truly one.
καὶ ἐξέπεμψαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι περὶ τὸ φθινόπωρον τρισχιλίους ὁπλίτας τῶν ξυμμάχων. τούτων ἦσαν πεντακόσιοι ἐξ Ἡρακλείας τῆς ἐν Τραχῖνι πόλεως τότε νεοκτίστου οὔσης·	And the Lacedaemonians, towards the end of autumn, sent them three thousand men of arms of their confederates of which five hundred were of Heracleia, the new-built city of Trachinia.
τὸν δὲ σύμπαντα χρόνον, ὃς ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν Ἰσραηλιτῶν αἰχμαλωσίας ἐπὶ τὴν τῶν δύο φυλῶν ἀνάστασιν ἐληλύθει, ἑκατὸν ἔτη καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ μῆνας ἓξ καὶ δέκα ἡμέρας συνέβη γενέσθαι.	The entire time from the captivity of the Israelites to the removal of the two tribes was a hundred and thirty years, six months and ten days.
τὸ δὲ μετὰ τοῦτο αὐτοῖς οἰκήσεις δεῖ χωρὶς διατεταγμένας εἶναι·	In the next place, there must be dwellings for the citizens separately arranged.
πλησίον δ’ ἐστὶ καὶ ἡ Πάτμος καὶ Κορασσίαι πρὸς δύσιν κείμεναι τῇ Ἰκαρίᾳ, αὕτη δὲ Σάμῳ.	Near these islands are Patmos, and the Corassia, islands, situated to the west of Icaria, as the latter is with respect to Samos.
οὐ γὰρ ἂν εἰδείηθ’ ὑμεῖς εἴτ’ ἐστὶν ἀληθῆ εἴτε ψευδῆ ἅ φασιν ἑκάτεροι, εἰ μή τις καὶ τοὺς μάρτυρας παρέχοιτο.	Otherwise you would not know whether what they severally say is true or false, if they did not bring forward the witnesses also.
καὶ ὠργίσθη ὀργῇ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τὴν Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ἔκστασιν καὶ εἰς συρισμόν, ὡς ὑμεῖς ὁρᾶτε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν.	The Lord was angered with wrath against Judah and Jerusalem, and he gave them into terror and hissing, as you see with your eyes.
νέοι γὰρ ὄντες πρεσβυτέροις ἐπιβάλλοντες, εἶθ’ οἷον παραβλαστάνοντες καὶ συνεξανιστάμενοι ταῖς ἐκείνων πολιτείαις καὶ πράξεσιν, ἐμπειρίαν καὶ συνήθειαν ἐκτῶντο πρὸς τὰ κοινὰ μετὰ δόξης καὶ δυνάμεως.	for these, when they were young, joining themselves with their elders, and afterwards as it were flourishing and growing up by their administrations and actions, gained experience, and were inured to the management of public affairs with reputation and power.
καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι πλείονα ποιήσονται τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν τῶν παίδων, μέλλοντες ἑκάστοτε διδόναι τὰς εὐθύνας.	For even that sort of men will take more care of the children, when they know that they are regularly to be called to account.
ὃ ἡτοίμασας κατὰ πρόσωπον πάντων τῶν λαῶν,	that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:
ἦ οὖν καὶ ἄλλοθί που τὸ τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν;	And is the same sort of thing possible in any other field?
τὴν δὲ πασῶν τε τούτων ἄρχουσαν καὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ συμπάντων τῶν κατὰ πόλιν ἐπιμελουμένην καὶ πάντα συνυφαίνουσαν ὀρθότατα, τοῦ κοινοῦ τῇ κλήσει περιλαβόντες τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῆς, προσαγορεύοιμεν δικαιότατ’ ἄν, ὡς ἔοικε, πολιτικήν.	But the art which holds sway over them all and watches over the laws and all things in the state, weaving them all most perfectly together, we may, I think, by giving to its function a designation which indicates its power over the community, with full propriety call statecraft.
εἰ ἀναγγελοῦσιν, ἐγγισάτωσαν, ἵνα γνῶσιν ἅμα τίς ἀκουστὰ ἐποίησεν ταῦτα ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς· τότε ἀνηγγέλη ὑμῖν Ἐγὼ ὁ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν ἐμοῦ, δίκαιος καὶ σωτήρ, οὐκ ἔστιν παρὲξ ἐμοῦ.	If they announce, let them approach, that they might know at once who made these things audible from the beginning. Then it will be announced to you, “I am God, and there is no other besides me, ⌊there is no righteous, or savior⌋, besides me.
οὐ γὰρ ἃ πράττουσιν οἱ δίκαιοι, ἀλλ’ ἃ μὴ πράττουσι, ταῦτα λέγεις.	You are saying not what the just do, but what they don’t do.
διὸ καὶ συνέστη τὰ κατὰ τὴν χειρονομίαν ἐπιμελεστέρως διὰ ταύτην τὴν αἰτίαν.	on which account men at that time paid more attention to moving their hands with graceful gestures
ἐξ αὐτῶν εὐλόγησεν καὶ ἀνύψωσεν, καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἡγίασεν καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἤγγισεν· ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν κατηράσατο καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ στάσεως αὐτῶν.	He blessed and exalted some, and he consecrated and drew some to him, he cursed and humbled some, and he turned them from their position.
τὸν δὲ Σαμαγόρειον οἶνον καλούμενόν φησιν ὁ Ἀριστοτέλης ἀπὸ τριῶν κοτυλῶν κερασθεισῶν μεθύσκειν ὑπὲρ τεσσαράκοντα ἄνδρας.	And Aristotle says, that the wine called the Samagorean wine was so strong that more than forty men were made drunk with a pint and a half of it after it had been mixed with water.
οὐδὲ χαίρω βατίσιν οὐδ᾽ ἐγχέλεσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἥδιον ἄν δικίδιον σμικρὸν φάγοιμ᾽ ἂν ἐν λοπάδι πεπνιγμένον.	i scorn your red mullet and your eels, and would far rather eat a nice little lawsuitlet cooked in the pot.
ἐμεγαλύνετο δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ μηδενὸς ἧττον πονεῖν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ἄρχειν ἑαυτοῦ μᾶλλον ἢ ἐπὶ τῷ βασιλεύειν.	he was proud that he wrought as much as any, and valued himself more upon ruling his own desires than upon being king.
θέατρον γὰρ αὐτοῖς κατεσκεύασε πολυτελείᾳ τε καὶ κάλλει πολλῶν διαφέρον ἀμφιθέατρόν τε πολλῶν ἀναλωμάτων βαλανεῖα πρὸς τούτοις καὶ στοάς, ἐν οὐδενὶ τῶν ἔργων στενότητι δαπανημάτων ἢ τὸ κάλλος ἀδικήσας ἢ τὸ μέγεθος.	for he erected a theater for them, superior to many others of that sort, both in Sumptuousness and elegance, as also an amphitheater, built at vast expenses and besides these, he built them baths and porticoes, and spared for no costs in any of his edifices, to render them both handsome and large.
τί ποιήσω μὴ περισπώμενος;	What shall I do, since I have no distraction?
οἷον ἡ γῆ ἆρ’ ἐστὶ δυνάμει ἄνθρωπος;	E.g., is earth potentially a man?
ἐν τούτοις καὶ Πτολεμαῖος διεβέβλητο καὶ Σαπίννιος οἱ πιστότατοι τῷ βασιλεῖ.	Among these were accused Ptolemy and Sapinnius, who were the most faithful friends to the king.
καὶ γὰρ εὔκαρπός ἐστι καὶ ἐρυσίβην γεννᾷ καὶ θρύον ἡ Τριφυλία· διόπερ ἀντὶ μεγάλης φορᾶς πυκνὰς ἀφορίας γίνεσθαι συμβαίνει κατὰ τοὺς τόπους.	For Triphylia is fertile, but the soil is subject to mildew, and produces rushes, whence in these places, instead of the product being large, there is frequently no crop whatever.
δῃουμένης δὲ τῆς χώρας, πολὺ μὲν ἦν τὸ τῶν ἁλισκομένων πλῆθος, ἔτι δὲ πλέον τὸ συμφεῦγον εἰς τὰς παρακειμένας κώμας καὶ τοὺς ἐρυμνοὺς τῶν τόπων.	In the course of this devastation of the country the number of the captives was indeed great, but a still greater number made their escape to the neighbouring villages and strongholds.
καίτοι λογισώμεθα· εἰ δειλόψυχοί τινες ἦσαν καὶ ἄνανδροι ἐν αὐτοῖς, ποίοις ἂν ἐχρήσαντο λόγοις; οὐχὶ τούτοις;	And further, let us consider if some had been fainthearted and cowardly among them, what kind of arguments might they have used. Would they not be these?
τοῦτο γὰρ δεύτερον ἔτος λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔτι λοιπὰ πέντε ἔτη ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἔσται ἀροτρίασις οὐδὲ ἄμητος·	For this is the second year famine is upon the land, and still there are remaining five years in which there will be neither plowing nor reaping.
αὐτός, ὦ Ἐχέκρατες. ΕΧ.	I was there myself, Echecrates. Echecrates.
τό γε μὴν πλεῖστον ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων ἐκφερόμενον περιεξαίνετο ταῖς ἀπορρῶξιν, ὡς αἱμαχθῆναι μὲν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τὸ πέλαγος, πληρωθῆναι δὲ νεκρῶν τὴν παράλιον·	although the greatest part of them were carried by the waves, and dashed to pieces against the abrupt parts of the rocks, insomuch that the sea was bloody a long way, and the maritime parts were full of dead bodies
Καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς οἶκον, καὶ συνέρχεται πάλιν ὁ ὄχλος ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι αὐτοὺς μηδὲ ἄρτον φαγεῖν.	Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat.
σεβόμενοι γὰρ τὸν ὀξύρυγχον ἰχθὺν δεδίασι μή ποτε τὸ ἄγκιστρον οὐ καθαρόν ἐστιν ὀξυρύγχου περιπεσόντος αὐτῷ.	for, having the fish called oxyrynchus (the pike) in great veneration, they are afraid lest the hook should chance to catch hold of it and by that means become polluted.
λέγωμεν δὴ τὸν πλείστας καὶ ἐφεξῆς μάλιστα διανομὰς ἐν αὑτῷ κεκτημένον.	Let us choose that which contains the most numerous and most consecutive sub-divisions.
ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔστι πω τέλεον, ὦ παῖ, τοῦτο λελεγμένον.	But, my boy, this is not yet completely stated
τὰ μὲν οἴκοι καταλείπω πάντα Λαμπυρίωνι καὶ Ἀρκεσιλάῳ.	All the goods in my house I give and bequeath to Lampyrio and Arcesilaus.
ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπεὶ παρεξέβην περὶ τῶν ἀρχαίων κράσεων διαλεγόμενος, ἐπαναλήψομαι τὸν λόγον τὰ ὑπὸ Ἀλκαίου τοῦ μελοποιοῦ λεχθέντα ἐπὶ νοῦν βαλλόμενος φησὶ γάρ που οὗτος·	But I, since I have now made this digression about the mix- tures of the ancients, will resume the thread of my original discourse where I let it drop considering what was said by Alcæus the lyric poet.
Λύσανδρος δ’ ἐκ τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου ναυσὶ διακοσίαις ἀφικόμενος εἰς Λέσβον κατεσκευάσατο τάς τε ἄλλας πόλεις ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ Μυτιλήνην·	Meanwhile Lysander, sailing out of the Hellespont with two hundred ships, arrived at Lesbos and arranged the affairs of Mytilene and the other cities of the island
στερεὰ δὲ σώματα λέγεσθαι χρὴ κατὰ τὸν εἰκότα λόγον πέντε, ἐξ ὧν κάλλιστα καὶ ἄριστά τις ἂν πλάττοι, τὸ δὲ ἄλλο γένος ἅπαν ἔχει μορφὴν μίαν·	On the most likely account there are to be reckoned five solid bodies, from which one might fashion things fairest and best
ἀρχὴ οὖν τοῦ γνωστοῦ περὶ ἕκαστον τὸ ἕν.	"the one," then, is the starting - point of what is knowable in respect of each particular thing.
ὑμεῖς δὲ αὐτοὶ δημοσίᾳ πῶς διέκεισθε;	How stood public opinion here?
Βοιωτοῖς δὲ δημοσίᾳ καθαρμός ἐστι κυνὸς διχοτομηθέντος τῶν μερῶν διεξελθεῖν αὐτοὶ δὲ Ῥωμαῖοι τοῖς Λυκαίοις, ἃ Λουπερκάλια καλοῦσιν, ἐν τῷ καθαρσίῳ μηνὶ κύνα θύουσιν.	and in Boeotia the ceremony of public purification is to pass between the parts of a dog which has been cut in twain. The Romans themselves, in the month of purification, at the Wolf Festival, which they call the Lupercalia, sacrifice a dog.
ἥ τε γὰρ σύγκλητος ἀπερεισαμένη τὴν χάριν ἐπὶ τὸν Δημήτριον ἐμετεώρισε μὲν τὸ μειράκιον, ἐλύπησε δὲ καὶ τὸν Περσέα καὶ τὸν Φίλιππον ἰσχυρῶς τῷ δοκεῖν μὴ δι’ αὐτούς, ἀλλὰ διὰ Δημήτριον τυγχάνειν τῆς παρὰ Ῥωμαίων φιλανθρωπίας.	For the Senate, by thus making much of Demetrius, somewhat turned the young man's head, and at the same time gravely annoyed Perseus and the king, by making them feel that the kindness they received from the Romans was not for their own sakes, but for that of Demetrius.
διὰ τοῦτο τίς ἤκουσέ ποτε Σωκράτους λέγοντος ὅτι οἶδά τι καὶ διδάσκω;	Hence who ever heard Socrates say, I know something and I teach
ἢ καθάπερ τῷ δεξιοῦσθαι καὶ παρακαλεῖν καὶ ὑποπίπτειν, οὕτω τῇ γυμνότητι ταπεινοῦντες ἑαυτοὺς ἐδημαγώγουν;	Or, as by courteous behavior, supplication, and submission, so by humbling themselves in nakedness did they gain on the affections of the common people?
ἡμῖν μέντοι πλέουσιν ἄλλοτ’ ἄλλῳ μέτρῳ χρώμενοι τῶν σχοίνων ἀπεδίδοσαν τὰ διαστήματα, ὥστε καὶ τετταρακοντασταδίους καὶ ἔτι μείζους κατὰ τόπους ὁμολογεῖσθαι παρ’ αὐτῶν.	When we ourselves sailed up the river, schoeni of different measures were used at different places in giving the distances, so that sometimes the received schnus was a measure of 40 stadia and even more.
καὶ ὁ Σώπατρος δέ, οὗ τὰ νῦν μέμνησαι, ἐν Νεκυίᾳ μνημονεύει οὕτως·	And Sopater, too, whom you were mentioning just now, in his Descent to Hell, speaks in these terms
ἐμοὶ δὲ οὔτε ἐξιόντι ἕωθεν οἴκοθεν ἠναντιώθη τὸ τοῦ θεοῦ σημεῖον, οὔτε ἡνίκα ἀνέβαινον ἐνταυθοῖ ἐπὶ τὸ δικαστήριον, οὔτε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ οὐδαμοῦ μέλλοντί τι ἐρεῖν.	but the divine sign did not oppose me either when I left my home in the morning, or when I came here to the court, or at any point of my speech, when I was going to say anything
ἐπεὶ δὲ Τροίαν ἦλθες Ἀργεῖοί τέ σου κατ’ ἴχνος, ἦν δὲ δοριπετὴς ἀγωνία, εἰ μὲν τὰ τοῦδε κρείσσον’ ἀγγέλλοιτό σοι, Μενέλαον ᾔνεις, παῖς ὅπως λυποῖτ’ ἐμὸς ἔχων ἔρωτος ἀνταγωνιστὴν μέγαν·	Then when you had come to Troy, and the Argives were on your track, and the mortal combat had begun, whenever tidings came to you of Menelaus’ prowess, you would praise him, to grieve my son, because he had so powerful a rival in his love
οὐδέποτε ἄρα ἐστὶ τὸ ἓν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ.	Then the one is never in the same.
τὰ γὰρ εὔχρηστα τῆς φιλίας δύσχρηστα γίγνεται διὰ τὴν πολυφιλίαν.	For multiplicity of friends renders those very parts of friendship vain and useless whence advantage was most expected
ἀλλὰ μὴν οἵ γε ἀγαθοὶ δίκαιοί τε καὶ οἷοι μὴ ἀδικεῖν;	But again the good are just and incapable of injustice.
πλὴν ὃ ἔχετε κρατήσατε ἄχρις οὗ ἂν ἥξω.	However, hold on to what you have until I come.
δι’ ἃ καὶ ἐπείπερ γεγένησθε, ἀθάνατοι μὲν οὐκ ἐστὲ οὐδ’ ἄλυτοι τὸ πάμπαν, οὔτι μὲν δὴ λυθήσεσθέ γε οὐδὲ τεύξεσθε θανάτου μοίρας, τῆς ἐμῆς βουλήσεως μείζονος ἔτι δεσμοῦ καὶ κυριωτέρου λαχόντες ἐκείνων οἷς ὅτ’ ἐγίγνεσθε συνεδεῖσθε.	Wherefore ye also, seeing that ye were generated, are not wholly immortal or indissoluble, yet in no wise shall ye be dissolved nor incur the doom of death, seeing that in my will ye possess a bond greater and more sovereign than the bonds wherewith, at your birth, ye were bound together.
ἡ δ’ ὥρα μετὰ τὴν βλάστησιν οὐ πολύ.	And the time when it is in season is not long after the tree has made its wood.
τούτῳ γὰρ ἀρῶ, τούτῳ θερίζω, τούτῳ πατέω τὸν ἁδὺν οἶνον ἀπ’ ἀμπέλω, τούτῳ δεσπότας μνοίας κέκλημαι.	With these I plough, and from the vine Squeeze out the heart-delighting wine
οὐ μέντοι μὰ Δί’, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, προσοιστέον.	No, by heaven, Socrates, he said, it must not come nigh them.
εἰ δ’ ἀπιστεῖς, ἐρώτησον αὐτούς, μᾶλλον δ’ ἐγὼ τοῦθ’ ὑπὲρ σοῦ ποιήσω.	If you doubt my word, ask them or rather I will ask them myself.
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐπήγγειλα αὐτῷ κομίσασθαι τὴν δίκην, ἐλθών μου τά τε σκεύη καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας καὶ τὰ πρόβατα ἔλαβεν ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀπολαβεῖν.	but when I served notice on him to come and collect the amount of the judgement, he went and seized my furniture and slaves and sheep instead of receiving payment.
καὶ φαγόντας ἐκέλευεν ὁπλίσασθαι, καὶ ἐπῆγεν ἀδοκήτως τοῖς πολεμίοις, τοὺς μὲν ἱππέας Σιλανῷ, τοὺς δὲ πεζοὺς Λαιλίῳ καὶ Μαρκίῳ παραδούς·	When they had taken their food he ordered them to arm themselves, and led them against the enemy, who were not expecting them, giving the command of the horse to Silanus and of the foot to Lælius and Marcius.
εἴ ποτε πάλιν ἔλθοι τῇ Ἑλλάδι κίνδυνος ὑπὸ βαρβάρων, τίσιν ἂν μᾶλλον πιστεύσαιτε ἢ Λακεδαιμονίοις;	If ever again danger should come to Greece from barbarians, whom would you trust more than the Lacedaemonians?
διὰ μὲν οὖν τῶν πρὸ τοῦ κινδύνων κεκρατήκατε τῆς χώρας καὶ τῶν ἐκ ταύτης ἀγαθῶν κατὰ τὰς ἡμετέρας ἐπαγγελίας, ἀψευστούντων ἡμῶν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἰρημένοις·	Now, by your previous battles you have got possession of the country and all its wealth, in accordance with my promises for I have been absolutely true in everything I have ever said to you.
καὶ τῆς ἡδονῆς ἕνεκα τὴν φιλίαν αἱρούμενος ὑπὲρ τῶν φίλων τὰς μεγίστας ἀλγηδόνας ἀναδέχεσθαι·	and when, choosing friendship for the sake of pleasure, that he suffers most grievous pains for his friends
ἀκούεις δή, ὦ Θεαίτητε, ἃ λέγει Θεόδωρος, ᾧ ἀπειθεῖν, ὡς ἐγὼ οἶμαι, οὔτε σὺ ἐθελήσεις, οὔτε θέμις περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἀνδρὶ σοφῷ ἐπιτάττοντι νεώτερον ἀπειθεῖν.	Well, Theaetetus, you hear what Theodorus says, and I think you will not wish to disobey him, nor is it right for a young person to disobey a wise man when he gives instructions about such matters.
ἔτι τούτῳ διαλέγομαι;	Shall I still argue with this man?
τίς γάρ ποτ’ ἀστῶν ἢ ξένων ἡμᾶς ἰδὼν τοιοῖσδ’ ἐπαίνοις οὐχὶ δεξιώσεται·	What citizen or stranger when he sees us will not greet us with praises such as these
φήσαντος δὲ τοὺς περὶ Ἡρώδην, Ἀντώνιος καὶ πάλαι οἰκείως ἔχων πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ τὴν πατρῴαν ξενίαν, ἣν ἡνίκα σὺν Γαβινίῳ παρῆν ἐπεποίητο πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν, τούτους μὲν ἀμφοτέρους τετράρχας καθίστησιν καὶ τὰ Ἰουδαίων αὐτοῖς ἐπιτρέπει πράγματα, γράφει δὲ καὶ γράμματα πεντεκαίδεκα τῶν ἀντιστασιαστῶν ἔδησεν, μέλλοντος δὲ καὶ κτείνειν αὐτοὺς παρῃτήσαντο οἱ περὶ Ἡρώδην.	He replied, Herod and his friends. Hereupon Antony, by reason of the old hospitable friendship he had made with his father [Antipater], at that time when he was with Gabinius, he made both Herod and Phasaelus tetrarchs, and committed the public affairs of the Jews to them, and wrote letters to that purpose. He also bound fifteen of their adversaries, and was going to kill them, but that Herod obtained their pardon.
τὸ γὰρ ἐφ’ αὑτῷ, εἰς ὃ ἀνάγεται ὅλον, τοῦτ’ ἐστιν ὃ ἡ αὐτοῦ φύσις οἵα τε φέρειν·	For what rests with himselfand it wholly turns on thismeans what his nature is able to bear
ἰδὼν δὲ Ἀχιὼρ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπίστευσεν τῷ θεῷ σφόδρα, καὶ περιετέμετο τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.	Achior, seeing all that the God of Israel had accomplished, trusted in God completely and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin; and he was added to the house of Israel until this day.
ἐπεὶ καὶ τῶν θηρίων πολλὰ μὲν δυσκίνητα καὶ νωθρὰ, ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὄντα πολλὰ δ’ ἀκόλαστα καὶ ἄτακτα τῶν συνετῶν καὶ πανούργων χρόνους ζῇ μακροτέρους.	for we know there are many animals which are dull, slow, and heavy, and many disorderly and lustful, which live longer than those that are more sagacious and quicker of sense.
τὴν τούτου χεῖρ᾽ ἐποίησεν Κυλλήνην ὀρθῶς, ὁτιή φησ᾽, ᾽ ἔμβαλε κυλλῇ.	the god in this oracle very clearly points to the hand of cleon, who incessantly holds his out, saying, " fill it. "
ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ἤδη που φέρει καὶ τὸ αὐτόματον·	So far, perhaps, these things may have happened of their own accord
παρελθὼν δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν, ἀνὴρ καὶ ξυνετὸς δοκῶν εἶναι καὶ σώφρων, ἔλεξε τοιάδε.	But Archidamus their king, a man reputed both wise and temperate, spake as followeth.
καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνο πῶς οὐ δεινόν ἐστιν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, ἐπὶ μὲν τοῦ λόγου αὐτίκα μάλα φήσειν ποιητὸν εἶναι, ἐν δὲ τῇ διαμαρτυρίᾳ τοῦτο μὴ τολμῆσαι γράψαι, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν ἐν ταύτῃ διαμεμαρτυρημένα εἶναι ὡς ὑπὲρ υἱοῦ γόνῳ γεγονότος, τὰ δ’ αὐτίκα μάλα ῥηθησόμενα ὡς εἰσποιητοῦ;	For is it not an outrageous thing, men of tlie jury, that he should state—as he will presently in his speech—that he is an adopted son, while in his affidavit he did not dare to write this? Or that, while in the affidavit the protest is made as though for a son of the body, the speech that will presently be made will be on behalf of an adopted son?
διὸ καλῶς ἀπεδοκίμασαν αὐτοῦ οἱ πρότερον τὴν χρῆσιν ἐκ τῶν νέων καὶ τῶν ἐλευθέρων, καίπερ χρησάμενοι τὸ πρῶτον αὐτῷ.	Hence former ages rightly rejected its use by the young and the free, although at first they had employed it.
ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, ἦ καὶ ἔχαιρον ἀκούοντες ἰόντας;	Tell me, then, said Cyrus, were they glad when they heard we were coming?
τῶν υἱῶν Χεβρών, Ἐνὴρ ὁ ἄρχων καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν ὀγδοήκοντα·	Of the descendants of Hebron: Ener the commander and their eighty brothers.
πῶς γὰρ οἷόν τε καταταχῆσαι, πῶς δὲ καταταχήσασαν ἀνύσασθαί τι τὴν πρεσβείαν, μήτε πόδας μήτε κεφαλὴν μήτε καρδίαν ἔχουσαν.	For how could a mission make haste, or if it did, how could it accomplish anything, when it had neither feet, head, nor intelligence?" . .
Ψαλμὸς τῷ Σαλωμών. Κύριε ὁ θεός, αἰνέσω τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει, ἐν μέσῳ ἐπισταμένων τὰ κρίματά σου τὰ δίκαια.	Lord God, I will praise your name with rejoicing among those who understand your righteous judgments.
ὁ δὲ ἔφη ἀγαθὸν γαμεῖν καὶ ἀγαθά τίκτειν.	and he said, Marry a good man, and bear good children.
τί οὖν; ἐπειδὴ καὶ τούτων ἑκατέρου τοῦ φύλου τὴν τάξιν οἶσθα, ἤδη ποτ’ ἐπεσκέψω, εἰς ποτέραν τῶν τάξεων τούτων σαυτὸν δικαίως ἂν τάττοις;	Well now, as you know the category to which each of these species belongs, have you ever considered in which category you ought to put yourself?
περιτυχὼν δ’ αὐτῇ ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ἀψάλωμος ἀνέκρινε, τίνος αὐτῇ δεινοῦ συμβάντος οὕτως ἔχει, κατειπούσης δ’ αὐτῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν τὴν ὕβριν ἡσυχάζειν καὶ μετρίως φέρειν παρηγόρει καὶ μὴ νομίζειν ὑβρίσθαι φθαρεῖσαν ὑπ’ ἀδελφοῦ.	Now Absalom, her brother, happened to meet her, and asked her what sad thing had befallen her, that she was in that plight and when she had told him what injury had been offered her, he comforted her, and desired her to be quiet, and take all patiently, and not to esteem her being corrupted by her brother as an injury.
παράδειγμα δὲ αὐτοῖς οὔτε αἱ τῶν πέλας ξυμφοραὶ ἐγένοντο, ὅσοι ἀποστάντες ἤδη ἡμῶν ἐχειρώθησαν, οὔτε ἡ παροῦσα εὐδαιμονία παρέσχεν ὄκνον μὴ ἐλθεῖν ἐς τὰ δεινά·	But these men would neither take example by their neighbour's calamity, who are, all that revolted, already subdued by us
ὁ δέ “συγγίνωσκε, φησίν, αὐτῷ διὰ τὸ γῆρας·	to which he answered, "Forgive him, on account of his age
μετὰ δὲ τούτους ἐλεφάντων ἅρματα ἀφείθη εἴκοσι τέτταρα καὶ συνωρίδες τράγων ἑξήκοντα, κώλων δεκαδύο, ὀρύγων ἑπτά, βουβάλων δεκαπέντε, στρουθῶν συνωρίδες ὀκτώ, ὀνελάφων ἑπτά, καὶ συνωρίδες δʹ ὄνων ἀγρίων, ἅρματα τέσσαρα.	"And after them came twenty-four chariots drawn by four elephants each, and sixty chariots each drawn by a pair of goats, and twelve chariots by antelopes, and seven by oryxes, and fifteen by buffaloes, eight by pairs of ostriches, and seven by gnus, and four by pairs of zebras, and four chariots also drawn each by four zebras.
καὶ εἰρήνευσεν ἡ βασιλεία Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ κατέπαυσεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν.	The dominion of Jehoshaphat made peace, and God put an end to things for him all around.
φάος δὲ τηλέπομπον οὐκ ἠναίνετο φρουρὰ προσαιθρίζουσα πόμπιμον φλόγα, λίμνην δ’ ὑπὲρ Γοργῶπιν ἔσκηψεν φάος:	Nor did the warders there disdain the far-flung light, but made a blaze higher than their commands.
ἔστι δὲ ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ φιλίᾳ τὰ ἐγκλήματα ἀμφιβάλλοντα αὐτοῖς ἀμφότερα, πῶς ἑκάτερος ἐγκαλεῖ, ὅταν ἠθικῶς ἀλλὰ μὴ νομικῶς πιστεύσωσιν. καὶ ἔχει δὴ ἀπορίαν ποτέρως δεῖ κρίνειν τὸ δίκαιον, πότερα πρὸς τὸ πρᾶγμα βλέποντα τὸ ὑπηρετηθὲν, πόσον, ἢ ποῖον ἦν τῷ πεπονθότι.	And in fact in this sort of friendship the recriminations are doubtful on both sideswhat line of accusation each party will take, inasmuch as their confidence was of a moral kind and not merely legal.Indeed it is a question in which of two ways one ought to judge what is a just return, whether by looking at the actual amount or quality of the service rendered, or by its amount or quality for the recipient
τὴν δ’ ἐπὶ τῷ Ῥήνῳ πρῶτοι τῶν ἁπάντων οἰκοῦσιν Ἐλουήττιοι, παρ’ οἷς εἰσιν αἱ πηγαὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐν τῷ Ἀδούλᾳ ὄρει.	The first of all the nations dwelling on the Rhine are the Helvetii, amongst whom are the sources of that river in Mount Adula, which forms part of the Alps.
ἀναλαβὼν οὖν τούς τε μισθοφόρους καὶ τοὺς πελταστάς, ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις καὶ τοὺς Ἰλλυριούς, προῆγε διαβὰς τὸν ποταμὸν ὡς ἐπὶ τοὺς λόφους.	He took therefore his mercenaries, peltasts, and Illyrians, and advanced across the river in the direction of the hills.
πότε γὰρ ἤκουσεν παρά τινος, τί ἐστιν ἔπαινος, τί ἐστι ψόγος, τίς ἑκατέρου φύσις;	For when did he hear from any one what applause, what censure is? What is the nature of each?
ἴθι δή, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, ὦ Θρασύμαχε, ἀπόκριναι ἡμῖν ἐξ ἀρχῆς.	Come then, Thrasymachus, I said, go back to the beginning and answer us.
ὧν παραγενομένων εἰς τὴν Ῥώμην, εἰσελθὼν ὁ Καλλικράτης εἰς τὴν σύγκλητον τοσοῦτον ἀπέσχε τοῦ ταῖς ἐντολαῖς ἀκολούθως διδάσκειν τὸ συνέδριον ὥστε τοὐναντίον ἐκ καταβολῆς ἐπεχείρησεν οὐ μόνον τῶν ἀντιπολιτευομένων κατηγορεῖν θρασέως, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν σύγκλητον νουθετεῖν.	But on their arrival at Rome Callicrates went before the Senate, and, so far from addressing it in accordance with his instructions, he on the contrary entered upon an elaborate denunciation of his political opponents and, not contented with that, he undertook to rebuke the Senate itself.
Ἔρχεται οὖν πρὸς Σίμωνα Πέτρον· λέγει αὐτῷ κύριε, σύ μου νίπτεις τοὺς πόδας;	Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
ἀλλ’ ἔστι τοῖς σεμνοῖς μὲν αὐθαδέστερος καὶ τοῖς κόλαξι πᾶσι, τοῖς σκώπτουσι δὲ ἑαυτὸν εὐόργητος·	— But he is harsh and rigorous to the solemn, But most good-humour'd to all flatterers, And all who jest with freedom.
οὐκ ἦν τοῦ πρὸς ὑμᾶς πολέμου πέρας οὐδ’ ἀπαλλαγὴ Φιλίππῳ, εἰ μὴ Θηβαίους καὶ Θετταλοὺς ἐχθροὺς ποιήσειε τῇ πόλει·	For Philip there could be no end or quittance of hostilities with Athens unless he should make the Thebans and Thessalians her enemies.
νῦν μὲν γὰρ ἡ προδοῦσα λέκτρ’ ἐμοῦ πατρὸς τέθνηκεν· εἰ δὲ δὴ κατακτενεῖτ’ ἐμέ, ὁ νόμος ἀνεῖται, κοὐ φθάνοι θνῄσκων τις ἄν·	As it is, she who betrayed my father’s bed has died, but if you take my life, the law becomes relaxed, and the sooner each one of you dies, the better
ἦσαν δ’ οὗτοι τῶν τε ἐξ οἴκου αὐτῷ συστρατευσαμένων καὶ τῶν Κυρείων τινές, καὶ Ἴωνες δὲ καὶ Αἰολεῖς καὶ Ἑλλησπόντιοι ἐχόμενοι.	men who had gone with Agesilaus from home and some of the Cyreians, dashed out in turn from their main body, closely followed by Ionians, Aeolians and Hellespontines.
ἰδοὺ γοῦν παρὰ μὲν Ἀθηναίοις γέγονε Μουσαῖος, παρὰ δὲ Θηβαίοις Λίνος.	For instance, Musaeus is claimed by Athens, Linus by Thebes.
οἱ δὲ Καρχηδόνιοι τάς τε ναῦς καὶ τὸν στρατηγὸν τῶν ὑπεναντίων ὑποχείριον ἔχοντες παραχρῆμα πρὸς τὸν Ἀννίβαν ἀπῆραν.	The Carthaginians having thus possessed themselves of the ships as well as the commander of their enemies, started to rejoin Hannibal.
ὡς γὰρ ἐγὼ ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτομάτου χθὲς ἥκοντος πλοίου ἤκουσά τινος Κλέανδρος ὁ ἐκ Βυζαντίου ἁρμοστὴς μέλλει ἥξειν πλοῖα καὶ τριήρεις ἔχων.	for as I heard from a man who chanced to arrive here yesterday on a ship, Cleander, the Lacedaemonian governor at Byzantium, is to come here with merchant vessels and men-of-war.
ἴδεν δὲ ὅτι οὐ δύναται πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνάρκησεν τὸ πλάτος τοῦ μηροῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τῷ παλαίειν αὐτὸν μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ·	He saw that he could not prevail against him, and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob’s thigh became numb when he wrestled with him.
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ ψυχήν, ᾗ καταμανθάνεις καὶ ὡς ἂν ἐμβλέπουσα χαρίζοιο καὶ ὅ τι ἂν λέγουσα εὐφραίνοις, καὶ ὅτι δεῖ τὸν μὲν ἐπιμελόμενον ἀσμένως ὑποδέχεσθαι, τὸν δὲ τρυφῶντα ἀποκλείειν, καὶ ἀρρωστήσαντός γε φίλου φροντιστικῶς ἐπισκέψασθαι καὶ καλόν τι πράξαντος σφόδρα συνησθῆναι καὶ τῷ σφόδρα σοῦ φροντίζοντι ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ κεχαρίσθαι·	And inside it you have a soul that teaches you what glance will please, what words delight, and tells you that your business is to give a warm welcome to an eager suitor, but to slam the door upon a coxcomb yes, and when a friend has fallen sick, to show your anxiety by visiting him and when he has had a stroke of good fortune, to congratulate him eagerly and if he is eager in his suit, to put yourself at his service heart and soul.
Περὶ δὲ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ἢ τῆς ὥρας οὐδεὶς οἶδεν οὐδὲ οἱ ἄγγελοι ἐν οὐρανῷ οὐδὲ ὁ υἱὸς εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ.	"But as for that day or hour no one knows it neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son except the Father.
καίτοι ταύτης τῆς μελέτης καὶ τῆς ἐπιμελείας, Αἰσχίνη, εἴπερ ἐκ ψυχῆς δικαίας ἐγίγνετο καὶ τὰ τῆς πατρίδος συμφέροντα προῃρημένης, τοὺς καρποὺς ἔδει γενναίους καὶ καλοὺς καὶ πᾶσιν ὠφελίμους εἶναι, συμμαχίας πόλεων, πόρους χρημάτων, ἐμπορίου κατασκευήν, νόμων συμφερόντων θέσεις, τοῖς ἀποδειχθεῖσιν ἐχθροῖς ἐναντιώματα.	Yet if all that assiduous practice, Aeschines, had been conducted in a spirit of honesty and of solicitude for your country’s well-being, it should have yielded a rich and noble harvest for the benefit of us all—alliances of states, new revenues, development of commerce, useful legislation, measures of opposition to our avowed enemies.
οὕτως ἐμοί τε ἀξιῶ ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐς κίνδυνον καὶ ἐς ταλαιπωρίαν πᾶσαν ἀδεῶς χρῆσθαι, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, γνόντας τοῦτον δὴ τὸν ὑφ’ ἁπάντων προβαλλόμενον λόγον, ὡς εἰ πολέμιός γε ὢν σφόδρα ἔβλαπτον, κἂν φίλος ὢν ἱκανῶς ὠφελοίην, ὅσῳ τὰ μὲν Ἀθηναίων οἶδα, τὰ δ’ ὑμέτερα ᾔκαζον·	For myself, therefore, Lacedaemonians, I beg you to use me without scruple for danger and trouble of every kind, and to remember the argument in every one's mouth, that if I did you great harm as an enemy, I could likewise do you good service as a friend, inasmuch as I know the plans of the Athenians, while I only guessed yours.
Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς προσκαλεσάμενος τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ εἶπεν· σπλαγχνίζομαι ἐπὶ τὸν ὄχλον ὅτι ἤδη ἡμέραι τρεῖς προσμένουσίν μοι καὶ οὐκ ἔχουσιν τί φάγωσιν. καὶ ἀπολῦσαι αὐτοὺς νήστεις οὐ θέλω μήποτε ἐκλυθῶσιν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.	Then Jesus called the disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way."
εἰπέ μοι, ἐπὶ τῷ κομᾷς καὶ κομψὸς εἶναι προσποιεῖ, κωμῳδολοιχῶν περὶ τὸν εὖ πράττοντ᾽ ἀεί;	tell me then what you have to be proud of? not so much mouthing, you, who so well know how to play the buffoon and to lick - spittle the rich!
τὸ δὲ ἐπὶ θάτερα κρημνοὶ καὶ φάραγγες, εἰς οὓς ἀποσφαλέντες κατεφθείροντο, καὶ οὔτε φυγῆς τις τόπον οὔτε ἀμύνης εἶχεν ἐπίνοιαν, ἀλλ' ὑπ' ἀμηχανίας ἐπ' οἰμωγὴν ἐτράποντο καὶ τοὺς ἐν ἀπογνώσεσιν ὀδυρμούς: ἀντήχει δ' αὐτοῖς τὸ παρὰ Ἰουδαίων ἐγκέλευσμα καὶ κραυγὴ χαιρόντων ἅμα καὶ τεθυμωμένων.	The precipices and valleys on either side, into which they often tumbled were such that there was nowhere to escape and no way to defend them could be found, until their distress was so great that they broke out in laments and cries like men in the depths of despair, echoed by the joyful cries of the Jews encouraging each other, blending the sounds of joy and fury.
τούτοισι τοίνυν ἐκπίπτει μάλιστα· οὗτοι γὰρ μάλιστα λεπτύνονται.	In them, therefore, dislocations happen most frequently, as being at that time most particularly reduced in flesh.
ἐψηφίσαντο δὲ οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τὰς σπονδὰς λελύσθαι καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι οὐ τοσοῦτον τῶν ξυμμάχων πεισθέντες τοῖς λόγοις ὅσον φοβούμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους μὴ ἐπὶ μεῖζον δυνηθῶσιν, ὁρῶντες αὐτοῖς τὰ πολλὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ὑποχείρια ἤδη ὄντα.	The Lacedaemonians gave sentence that the peace was broken and that war was to be made, not so much for the words of the confederates as for fear the Athenian greatness should still increase. For they saw that a great part of Greece was fallen already into their hands.
ἐν αἷς Θεοπόμπου μὲν κατηγορεῖ διότι Διονυσίου ποιησαμένου τὴν ἀνακομιδὴν ἐκ Σικελίας εἰς Κόρινθον ἐν μακρᾷ νηί, Θεόπομπός φησιν ἐν στρογγύλῃ παραγενέσθαι τὸν Διονύσιον, Ἐφόρου δὲ πάλιν ἄγνοιαν καταψεύδεται, φάσκων λέγειν αὐτὸν ὅτι Διονύσιος ὁ πρεσβύτερος παρελάμβανε τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐτῶν εἴκοσι τριῶν ὑπάρχων, δυναστεύσαι δὲ τετταράκοντα καὶ δύο, μεταλλάξαι δὲ τὸν βίον προσλαβὼν τοῖς ἑξήκοντα τρία·	For instance he finds fault with Theopompus for stating that Dionysius sailed from Sicily to Corinth in a merchant vessel, whereas he really arrived in a ship of war. And again he falsely charges Ephorus with contradicting himself, on the ground that he asserts that Dionysius the Elder ascended the throne at the age of twenty-three, reigned forty-two years, and died at sixty-three.
ἀλλ’ αἰσθόμενοι ἐκ τοῦ τρόπου τούτου τὸ ὑμέτερον πλῆθος καταλυθησόμενον, οὐδ’, ὥς φασί τινες, οὐκ ἐπιθυμοῦντες εἰρήνην γίγνεσθαι, ἀλλὰ βουλόμενοι βελτίω ταύτης εἰρήνην τῷ δήμῳ τῷ Ἀθηναίων ποιήσασθαι.	but they could see that this would be the means of subverting your democracy nor were they lacking, as some declare, in eagerness for the conclusion of peace, but they desired to arrange a better peace than this for the Athenian people.
ἀλλ’ εἴπερ γε οἶμαι ἔστιν, ἀνάγκη αὐτὸ ἀεί, ἕωσπερ ἂν ᾖ, ἕν γέ τι εἶναι, μηδὲν δὲ ἀδύνατον.	But if there is, it must, I imagine, so long as it is, be some one thing it cannot be nothing.
καὶ συνῆλθον ἐκ μὲν τῆς Ἰούδα φυλῆς ὁπλιτῶν ὡς ὀκτακόσιοι καὶ ἑξακισχίλιοι φοροῦντες ὅπλα θυρεὸν καὶ σιρομάστην: οὗτοι δὲ τῷ Σαούλου παιδὶ παρέμενον: τούτων γὰρ χωρὶς ἡ Ἰούδα φυλὴ τὸν Δαυίδην ἀπέδειξε βασιλέα.	Then about six thousand eight hundred warriors of the tribe of Judas, armed with shields and spears, came to him, who had continued with Saul's son, when the rest of the tribe of Judas had chosen David as their king.
δοκοῦσι μέντοι μοι μάλιστα θέσθαι οἱ ἀμφὶ Ὀρφέα τοῦτο τὸ ὄνομα, ὡς δίκην διδούσης τῆς ψυχῆς ὧν δὴ ἕνεκα δίδωσιν, τοῦτον δὲ περίβολον ἔχειν, ἵνα σῴζηται, δεσμωτηρίου εἰκόνα· εἶναι οὖν τῆς ψυχῆς τοῦτο, ὥσπερ αὐτὸ ὀνομάζεται, ἕως ἂν ἐκτείσῃ τὰ ὀφειλόμενα, σῶμα, καὶ οὐδὲν δεῖν παράγειν οὐδ’ ἓν γράμμα.	But I think it most likely that the Orphic poets gave this name, with the idea that the soul is undergoing punishment for something they think it has the body as an enclosure to keep it safe, like a prison, and this is, as the name itself denotes, the safe (σῶμα) for the soul, until the penalty is paid, and not even a letter needs to be changed.
τοῦ δὲ πνεύματος αὐτῷ ἐνδέοντος, Νεοπτολέμῳ τῷ ὑποκριτῇ μυρίας δοῦναι, ἵν’ ὅλας περιόδους ἀπνεύστως λέγῃ.	And being naturally short-winded, he gave Neoptolemus a player ten thousand drachms to teach him to pronounce long sentences in one breath.
ὦ ταλαίπωροι Φρύγες πάντες τ’ Ἀχαιοί, δι’ ἔμ’ ἐπὶ Σκαμανδρίοις ἀκταῖσιν Ἥρας μηχαναῖς ἐθνῄσκετε, δοκοῦντες Ἑλένην οὐκ ἔχοντ’ ἔχειν Πάριν.	Miserable Phrygians, and all the Achaeans! On my account you were dying by the banks of Skamandros, through Hera’s contrivance, for you thought that Paris had Helen when he didn’t.
συνελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐν Ἄργει αὖθις μετὰ τὴν ῥηθεῖσαν ὀκταετίαν, ἐν ἀπορίᾳ τοῦ πλοῦ πολλῇ καθεστήκεσαν, καθηγεμόνα μὴ ἔχοντες, ὃς ἦν δυνατὸς δεῖξαι τὴν εἰς Τροίαν.	Having again assembled at Aulis after the aforesaid interval of eight years, they were in great perplexity about the voyage, because they had no leader who could show them the way to Troy.
εἰ γὰρ ἡ ἀποβολὴ αὐτῶν καταλλαγὴ κόσμου, τίς ἡ πρόσλημψις εἰ μὴ ζωὴ ἐκ νεκρῶν;	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
Πραθεὶς δὲ ὁμοφύλῳ τις ἓξ ἔτη δουλευέτω, τῷ δ’ ἑβδόμῳ ἐλεύθερος ἀφείσθω·	If any one be sold to one of his own nation, let him serve him six years, and on the seventh let him go free.
ἐκεῖνον γὰρ ᾄδειν μὲν οὐ φάναι μαθεῖν οὐδὲ κιθαρίζειν, πόλιν δὲ ποιῆσαι μεγάλην καὶ πλουσίαν ἐπίστασθαι·	That hero, they said, declared that he had not learned to sing, nor even to play the lyre, but knew how to make a city great and rich.
Καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες ἐκεῖθεν οἱ ἄνδρες ἦλθον εἰς Σόδομα· Ἀβραὰμ δὲ ἦν ἑστηκὼς ἐναντίον Κυρίου.	And, having turned back from there, the men came to Sodom, and Abraham was standing before the Lord.
ἕπου δέ μοι πρὸς ναῦς, καλὸν νύμφευμα τῷ στρατηλάτῃ.	Follow me now to the ships to grace the wedding of our chief.
οὐχὶ δὲ μόνον, ἵνα πράξῃς τὸ σαυτῷ πρέπον;	And do not I only tell you, that you may do what is becoming to yourself?
ἀλλ’ εἴτε λαιὸν εἴτε δεξιὸν κέρας εἴτ’ ἐν μέσοισι συμμάχοις πάρεστί σοι πέλτην ἐρεῖσαι καὶ καταστῆσαι στρατόν.	But on the left wing or the right or in the centre of the allies you may plant your shield and marshal your troops.
ἰδὼν γάρ τινα παντελῶς πέτρας σκάπτοντα καὶ ἐργαζόμενον, διὰ τὸ θαυμάσαι τὸν παῖδα ἐκέλευσεν ἐρέσθαι, τί γίγνεται ἐκ τοῦ χωρίου.	he saw a man at farm - work, digging mere rocks, and because of his surprise ordered his servant to ask what crop the farm grew
σχεδὸν γὰρ ἄδηλον ὁποία νὺξ ἢ φῶς αὐτὸ γεννήσει.	for it is very uncertain what day or what night will be the originating cause of it.
προσῆν δὲ τῇ κοινῇ κακοδοξίᾳ τὸ διὰ τὴν οἰκίαν οὐ μικρὸν μῖσος, ἣν ᾤκει, Πομπηΐου τοῦ Μεγάλου γενομένην, ἀνδρὸς οὐχ ἧττον ἐπὶ σωφροσύνῃ καὶ τῷ τεταγμένως καὶ δημοτικῶς διαιτᾶσθαι θαυμασθέντος ἢ διὰ τοὺς τρεῖς θριάμβους.	And to his general ill-repute there was added the great hatred caused by the house in which he dwelt. It had been that of Pompey the Great, a man no less admired for sobriety and for the orderly and democratic disposition of his life than because of his three triumphs.
πρὸ τοῦ ἡμᾶς πιστεῦσαι τῷ θεῷ ἦν ἡμῶν τὸ κατοικητήριον τῆς καρδίας φθαρτὸν καὶ ἀσθενές, ὡς ἀληθῶς οἰκοδομητὸς ναὸς διὰ χειρός, ὅτι ἦν πλήρης μὲν εἰδωλολατρείας καὶ ἦν οἶκος δαιμονίων διὰ τὸ ποιεῖν, ὅσα ἦν ἐναντία τῷ θεῷ,	Before we believed in God the habitation of our heart was corrupt and Weak, like a temple really built with hands, because it was full of idolatry, and was the house of demons through doing things which were contrary to God.
ὅταν εὐτελῶς ἡρμοσμένος ᾖς κατὰ τὸ σῶμα, μὴ καλλωπίζου ἐπὶ τούτῳ μήδ’, ἂν ὕδωρ πίνῃς, ἐκ πάσης ἀφορμῆς λέγε, ὅτι ὕδωρ πίνεις.	When at a small cost you are supplied with every thing for the body, do not be proud of this nor, if you drink water, say on every occasion, I drink water.
καὶ λέγουσιν ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ Οὐ κατορθοῖ ἡ ὁδὸς Κυρίου. μὴ ἡ ὁδός μου οὐ κατορθοῖ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ; οὐχὶ ἡ ὁδὸς ὑμῶν οὐ κατορθοῖ;	But the house of Israel say: ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Is my way not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your way that is not right?
ταύτῃ δὲ συνάπτει ἡ Παραιτακηνὴ καὶ ἡ Κοσσαία μέχρι Κασπίων πυλῶν, ὀρεινὰ καὶ λῃστρικὰ ἔθνη·	Close to it adjoin Partacene, and the Cossan territory as far as the Caspian Gates, inhabited by mountainous and predatory tribes.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς, ἔφη, θύωμεν, ὅτι τῆς τοῦ στρατηγοῦ μανίας καὶ ἀπονοίας τὴν δίκην εἰς τοὺς στρατιώτας οὐ τρέπουσιν, ἀλλὰ φείδονται τῆς πόλεως.	However, said he, let us also sacrifice to the gods, because they do not turn the punishment for the general’s folly and madness upon his soldiers, but spare the city.
καὶ τὸ μὲν παρὰ τοῖς ἄλλοις διαχωρεῖν ἴσως οὐ θαυμαστόν, τὸ δέ, παρ’ οἷς ἡ πηγὴ τῆς τοιαύτης ὑπάρχει κακοπραγμοσύνης.	That other men should allow themselves to be taken in is perhaps not astonishing but it is wonderful that those should do so who are the authors and origin of the same kind of malpractice.
ἔς τε τὸ ἐν Ἔρυκι ἱερὸν τῆς Ἀφροδίτης ἀγαγόντες αὐτοὺς ἐπέδειξαν τὰ ἀναθήματα, φιάλας τε καὶ οἰνοχόας καὶ θυμιατήρια καὶ ἄλλην κατασκευὴν οὐκ ὀλίγην, ἃ ὄντα ἀργυρᾶ πολλῷ πλείω τὴν ὄψιν ἀπ’ ὀλίγης δυνάμεως χρημάτων παρείχετο·	They brought them into the temple of Venus in Eryx and showed them the holy treasure, goblets, flagons, censers, and other furniture, in no small quantity which being but silver, appeared to the eye a great deal above their true value in money.
δῆλον ὅτι ἡ χρηστικὴ δύναμις ταῖς φαντασίαις.	Evidently it is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances.
οἱ δ’ εἰς μῦθον ἀνήγαγον τὸ ἔπος καὶ χρυσὸν ὑσθῆναί φασιν ἐν τῇ νήσῳ κατὰ τὴν Ἀθηνᾶς γένεσιν ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ Διός, ὡς εἴρηκε Πίνδαρος.	Other writers have applied these verses to a fable, according to which, at the birth of Minerva, it rained gold on the island from the head of Jupiter, as Pindar has said.
καὶ μὴν εἰ δεῖται μὲν θρέψεως, οὐδὲν δ’ ἡ πρὸς τὸ κενούμενον ἀκολουθία βοηθεῖν αὐτοῖς δύναται διά τε τὰς ἔμπροσθεν εἰρημένας ἀπορίας καὶ διὰ τὴν ὑπόγυιον ἰσχνότητα, καθάπερ δείξω, ζητητέον ἡμῖν ἐστιν ἑτέραν αἰτίαν θρέψεως.	Now, if on the one hand they stand in need of feeding-up, and if on the other the principle of the refilling of a vacuum can give them no help- both by reason of the difficulties previously mentioned and the actual thinness, as I shall show- we must then seek another cause for nutrition.
καὶ τὸ ὁρικὸν δὲ ὁμοίως πρὸς ἐπίγνωσιν τῆς ἀληθείας· διὰ γὰρ τῶν ἐννοιῶν τὰ πράγματα λαμβάνεται.	And similarly the part about definitions is accepted as a means of recognizing truth, inasmuch as things are apprehended by means of general notions.
καίτοι τῶν γ’ ἐμῶν καὶ σῶν πολιτῶν, ὦ Κλεινία, πολὺ κάκιον ἦσαν πεπαιδευμένοι τὰς ψυχάς, τὰ δὲ σώματα πολὺ μᾶλλον σφριγῶντες.	And yet, Clinias, these men were not only much worse educated in soul then your citizens and mine, but they also possessed much more sexual vigor of body.
ἴσθι μέντοι ἀνόητος ὤν, εἰ οἴει τὴν ὑμετέραν ἀρετὴν περιγενέσθαι ἂν τῆς βασιλέως δυνάμεως.	be sure, however, that you are a fool if you imagine that your valour could prove superior to the King’s might.
καὶ πολλὰ προσηντιβόλει φείσασθαι τῆς πατρίδος καὶ διασκεδάσαι τοῦ ναοῦ γευόμενον ἤδη τὸ πῦρ, τούς τ' ἐναγισμοὺς ἀποδοῦναι τῷ θεῷ.	earnestly appealing to them to spare their city and to prevent the fire which was already licking at the temple and to render to God his due sacrifices.
ὄνομα δ’ ἔστιν αὐτῷ Λεωχάρης.	It is by a young and good craftsman named Leochares.
ὑμεῖς δὲ οἱ δοῦλοι ὑποταγήσεσθε τοῖς κυρίοις ὑμῶν ὡς τύπτῳ θεοῦ ἐν αἰσχύνῃ καὶ φόβῳ.	And you bondmen shall be subject to your masters as to a type of God, in modesty and fear.
ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ οὐ τούτους λέγω, ἀλλ’ οἳ οὐδ’ εἰς τἀναγκαῖα ἔχουσι δαπανᾶν, γεωργεῖν φάσκοντες.	But I am referring rather to those who haven’t the money to meet even the necessary expenses, though professing to be farmers.
ἀλλά μοι δοκεῖ κατὰ τὴν κοινὴν παροιμίαν εὐτυχῆσαι μὲν ἄνθρωπον ὄντα δυνατόν, διευτυχῆσαί γε μὴν ἀδύνατον·	But it was, I suppose, a case of the common proverb, "a man may have a stroke of luck, but no man can be lucky always."
Πᾶς ὁ παραβαίνων καὶ μὴ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ χριστοῦ, θεὸν οὐκ ἔχει· ὁ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ χριστοῦ, οὗτος καὶ τὸν πατέρα καὶ τὸν υἱὸν ἔχει.	Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
ἄθρει δὴ περισκοπῶν μή τις τῶν ἀμυήτων ἐπακούῃ.	Look round and see that none of the uninitiated is listening.
χρῆν σ’, εἴπερ ἦσθα τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖσιν φίλος, τὸν χρυσὸν ὃν φῂς οὐ σὸν ἀλλὰ τοῦδ’ ἔχειν δοῦναι φέροντα πενομένοις τε καὶ χρόνον πολὺν πατρῴας γῆς ἀπεξενωμένοις·	if you were really a friend to those Achaeans, you should have brought the gold, which you say you are keeping not for yourself but for this man, and given it to them, for they were in need and had endured a long exile from their native land.
ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τῶν ἰδεῶν καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον καὶ διὰ λογικωτέρων καὶ ἀκριβεστέρων λόγων ἔστι πολλὰ συναγαγεῖν ὅμοια τοῖς τεθεωρημένοις.	Indeed, as regards the Ideas, we can collect against them plenty of evidence similar to that which we have now considered not only by the foregoing methods, but by means of more abstract and exact reasoning.
ταῦτα τοῦ μὲν Αἰμιλίου τοὺς ἡγεμόνας, τῶν δ’ ἡγεμόνων τοὺς στρατιώτας διδασκόντων, ὡς πρῶτον ὑπέδυσαν καὶ διέσχον εἴσω τῶν ὅπλων, τοῖς μὲν ἐκ πλαγίου κατὰ γυμνὰ προσφερόμενοι,	These instructions being given by Aemilius to his officers, and by his officers to the soldiers, as soon as they got between the ranks of the enemy and separated them, they attacked some of them in the flank where their armour did not shield them,
Ἦσαν δὲ ἐκεῖ ὑδρίαι λίθιναι ἓξ κείμεναι κατὰ τὸν καθαρισμὸν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, χωροῦσαι ἀνὰ μετρητὰς δύο ἢ τρεῖς.	Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece.
καὶ μὴν εἰ διεδέχετο τὴν ἑλκτικὴν δύναμιν ἡ ἐκκριτικὴ καὶ μὴ μέση τις ἀμφοῖν ἦν ἡ καθεκτική, διὰ παντὸς ἐχρῆν ἀνατεμνομένων τῶν ζῴων ἴσον πλῆθος χολῆς εὑρίσκεσθαι κατὰ τὴν κύστιν·	Now, of course, if the eliminative were to succeed the attractive faculty and there were not a retentive faculty between the two, there would be found, on every occasion that animals were dissected, an equal quantity of bile in the gall-bladder.
τὰ προφανῆ μὲν γὰρ κἂν ἐκ λογισμοῦ καὶ λόγου τις προέλοιτο, τὰ δ’ ἐξαίφνης κατὰ τὴν ἕξιν.	one might resolve to face a danger one can foresee, from calculation and on principle, but only a fixed disposition of Courage will enable one to face sudden peril.
καὶ μήν, ὡς ἐγᾦμαι, ἅ γε μείζω πόνον παρέχει μανθάνοντι καὶ μελετῶντι, οὐκ ἂν ῥᾳδίως οὐδὲ πολλὰ ἂν εὕροις ὡς τοῦτο. οὐ γὰρ οὖν. πάντων δὴ ἕνεκα τούτων οὐκ ἀφετέον τὸ μάθημα, ἀλλ’ οἱ ἄριστοι τὰς φύσεις παιδευτέοι ἐν αὐτῷ. σύμφημι, ἦ δ’ ὅς.	“And, further, as I believe, studies that demand more toil in the learning and practice than this we shall not discover easily nor find many of them.” “You will not, in fact.” “Then, for all these reasons, we must not neglect this study, but must use it in the education of the best endowed natures.” “I agree,” he said.
ὀψέ τε ἀφ’ οὗ Ἀθηναίους Θεμιστοκλῆς ἔπεισεν Αἰγινήταις πολεμοῦντας, καὶ ἅμα τοῦ βαρβάρου προσδοκίμου ὄντος, τὰς ναῦς ποιήσασθαι αἷσπερ καὶ ἐναυμάχησαν·	It was quite at the end of this period that the war with Aegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled Themistocles to persuade the Athenians to build the fleet with which they fought at Salamis
δεῦρο Ἄνυτε, Κέφαλε, ἔτι δὲ καὶ οἱ φυλέται οἱ ᾑρημένοι μοι συνδικεῖν, Θράσυλλος καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι.	Come, Anytus and Cephalus come, Thrasyllus and you others of my tribe who have been chosen to support me.
οὐ γὰρ δύναμαι μαθεῖν οὔθ’ ἥτις οὔτ’ ἐν οἷστισιν·	For I am unable to learn either what it is, or in whom
μεταξὺ μὲν οὖν τοῦ Σούκρωνος καὶ τῆς Καρχηδόνος τρία πολίχνια Μασσαλιωτῶν ἔστιν οὐ πολὺ ἄπωθεν τοῦ ποταμοῦ·	Between the Xucar and Carthage are three small towns of the people of Marseilles, not far from the river.
ὠνομάσθη δὲ καὶ Πιτυοῦσσα ἀπὸ τοῦ φυτοῦ·	Salamis was called also Pityussa from pitys, the pine tree.
ὁ δὲ νυκτὸς τὰ συνήθη πυρὰ καίεσθαι καταλιπὼν καὶ τοὺς σαλπιγκτὰς σημαίνειν τὰ διαστήματα τῆς νυκτός, ὥσπερ ἦν ἔθος, ἔλαθε μετὰ τῶν εὐζώνων ὑπεξελθὼν τοῦ στρατοπέδου, οἷς οὐδὲ αὐτοῖς προεῖπεν, οἷ χωρήσειν ἔμελλεν.	When night came Pompeius left the customary fires burning, and the trumpets giving the usual signal at intervals through the night, while he quietly withdrew from the camp with a well-prepared band, who had not been previously advised whither they were to go.
καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἀνέκαμψεν Ῥοβοάμ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν συναγωγήν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὀπίσω Δαυεὶδ παρὲξ σκήπτρου Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν, μόνοι.	It came to pass when all Israel heard that Rehoboam had returned, he sent and called him to the assembly, and they appointed him king over Israel No one was behind David other than the tribe of Judah and that of Benjamin alone.
μαθητεύσοις δὲ τῷ πατρὶ ἦν γὰρ σοφιστῆς, ᾧ καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδην φασὶν ἑτι παῖδα ὄντα φοιτῆσαἰ καὶ δύναμιν λόγων κτησάμενος, ὥς τινες νομίζουσιν, ἀπ’ οἰκείας φύσεως, ὥρμησε μὲν πολιτεύεσθαι·	He was a pupil of his father (for his father was a sophist, and it is said that Alcibiades as a boy attended his school), and having acquired power in speaking - as some think, through his own natural ability - he entered upon a public career.
μεγάλη δ’ ἡ Ἰέρνη πρὸς ἄρκτον αὐτῇ παραβεβλημένη, προμήκης μᾶλλον πλάτος ἔχουσα.	but one, of great extent, Ierna, lying parallel to it towards the north, long, or rather, wide
Ἀλλ' ἐν αὐταῖς ἀνάμνησις ἁμαρτιῶν κατ' ἐνιαυτόν·	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
καὶ Κάνθαρος· α. οὐκοῦν ἀκρατισώμεθ’ αὐτοῦ.	And Cantharus says— A. Shall we, then, take our ἀκρατισμὸς there?
εἰσὶ δὲ πλεῖστοι μὲν πάντων ἀρετῇ τε κράτιστοι ἐν Λιπάραις·	A goodly troop there are Of such, and those of finest flavour, where The isles of Lipara do gem the ocean
ξυνεκφέρει δὲ ὁ βουλόμενος καὶ ἀστῶν καὶ ξένων, καὶ γυναῖκες πάρεισιν αἱ προσήκουσαι ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον ὀλοφυρόμεναι.	The funeral is accompanied by any that will, whether citizen or stranger and the women of their kindred are also by at the burial lamenting and mourning.
ὁ δὲ καὶ μέχρι τῶν τοῦ κόσμου περάτων κατωπτευκέναι τὴν προσάρκτιον τῆς Εὐρώπης πᾶσαν, ἣν οὐδ’ ἂν τῷ Ἑρμῇ πιστεύσαι τις λέγοντι.	while the former asserts that he has actually seen the whole northern coast of Europe up to the very verge of the world, which one would hardly believe of Hermes himself if he said it.
οὕτω δὴ καὶ φιλόσοφος ἀνὴρ ἐν συμπόταις μὴ δεχομένοις τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ μεταθέμενος ἕψεται καὶ ἀγαπήσει τὴν ἐκείνων διατριβὴν, ἐφ’ ὅσον μὴ ἐκβαίνει τὸ εὔσχημον·	So a philosopher, midst those companions that slight his excellent discourse, will lay aside his gravity, follow them, and comply with their humor as far as decency will permit
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ εἰς τὴν ἀρχὴν παρῆλθεν, ἀποπεμψάμενος ἣν ἰδιώτης ἦκτο γαμετήν, γένος ἦν ἐξ Ἱεροσολύμων Δωρὶς ὄνομα, γαμεῖ Μαριάμμην τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου τοῦ Ἀριστοβούλου θυγατέρα, δι' ἣν αὐτῷ στασιασθῆναι συνέβη τὸν οἶκον καὶ τάχιον μέν, μάλιστα δὲ μετὰ τὴν ἐκ Ῥώμης ἄφιξιν.	For when he came to power he set aside the Jerusalem woman named Doris, whom he had married earlier when he was a private citizen, and married Mariamne, the daughter of Alexander, son of Aristobulus. Disturbances soon arose in his family on her account, but mainly after his return from Rome.
φασὶ γάρ πού τινα τοῦτο παθόντα οὐκ ἐθέλειν λέγειν οἷον ἦν πλὴν τοῖς δεδηγμένοις, ὡς μόνοις γνωσομένοις τε καὶ συγγνωσομένοις εἰ πᾶν ἐτόλμα δρᾶν τε καὶ λέγειν ὑπὸ τῆς ὀδύνης.	you know it is related of one in such a plight that he refused to describe his sensations to any but persons who had been bitten themselves, since they alone would understand him and stand up for him if he should give way to wild words and actions in his agony.
πιστοτέρη γὰρ ἡ ὄψις ἁπάσης ἄλλης αἰσθήσιος, οὐ τῶν ἀναγομένων μοῦνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ εἴδεος τοῦ νοσέοντος.	for the sight is more to be trusted than any other sense, not only with regard to the sputa, but also respecting the form of the disease.
εἰ δ’ οὖν ὑπόθοιτό τις ἀληθὲς εἶναι τὸ λεγόμενον, οὐ βέλτιόν ἐστι ψυχρότητας αἰτιᾶσθαί τινας καὶ ὑγρότητας ἀέρων, ὑφ’ ὧν τὸ πῦρ μαραινόμενον εἰκός ἐστι μὴ κρατεῖν πολλῆς μηδὲ δεῖσθαι τροφῆς, ἢ τοὐναντίον ξηρότητας καὶ θερμότητας;	And granting what you say concerning this measure of oil, is it not better to attribute the cause of this to some coldness or dampness of air or, on the contrary, to some heat or dryness, by which the fire in the lamp being weakened needs not so much nourishment, and could not consume the same quantity?
Διόπερ ὅστις περὶ τραγῳδίας οἶδε σπουδαίας καὶ φαύλης, οἶδε καὶ περὶ ἐπῶν· ἃ μὲν γὰρ ἐποποιία ἔχει, ὑπάρχει τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ, ἃ δὲ αὐτή, οὐ πάντα ἐν τῇ ἐποποιίᾳ.	Consequently any one who knows about tragedy, good and bad, knows about epics too, since tragedy has all the elements of epic poetry, though the elements of tragedy are not all present in the epic.
ἀλλ᾽ οὐ προκόψουσιν ἐπὶ πλεῖον· ἡ γὰρ ἄνοια αὐτῶν ἔκδηλος ἔσται πᾶσιν, ὡς καὶ ἡ ἐκείνων ἐγένετο.¶	But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.
πολύ γε μὴν ὑπερεῖχον οἱ περὶ τὸν Λυκόρταν.	in which, however, Lycortas and Polybius got a considerable majority on their side.
οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἀποστᾶσι γέγονεν ὧν προσεδόκησαν, ἀλλ’ ἀντὶ μὲν τῆς ἐλευθερίας τοὐναντίον ἀποβέβηκεν ἀπολέσαντες γὰρ αὑτῶν τοὺς βελτίστους ἐπὶ τοῖς χειρίστοις τῶν πολιτῶν γεγόνασιν, ἀντὶ δὲ τῆς αὐτονομίας εἰς πολλὰς καὶ δεινὰς ἀνομίας ἐμπεπτώκασιν,	For by revolting from us they have gained nothing of what they anticipated on the contrary, they have got just the opposite of freedom for having slain the best of their citizens, they are now in the power of the worst instead of securing self-government, they have been plunged into misgovernment of many terrible kinds
τοὺς δὲ θεωροὺς ὑπονοήσαντας χαριζομένην τοῖς Πελασγοῖς τὴν προφῆτιν κατὰ τὸ συγγενὲς ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν Πελασγικὸν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὑπῆρξεν οὕτως ἀνελεῖν, ἁρπάσαντας τὴν ἄνθρωπον εἰς πυρὰν ἐμβαλεῖν ἐνθυμηθέντας, εἴτε κακουργήσασαν εἴτε μή, πρὸς ἀμφότερα ὀρθῶς ἔχειν, εἰ μὲν παρεχρηστηρίασε, κολασθείσης αὐτῆς, εἰ δ’ οὐδὲν ἐκακούργησε, τὸ προσταχθὲν αὐτῶν πραξάντων.	The messengers sent to consult the oracle suspecting the prophetess of favouring the Pelasgi on account of their relationship, (for the temple had originally belonged to the Pelasgi,) seized the woman, and threw her upon a burning pile, considering, that whether her conduct bad been right or wrong, in either case they were right for if she had uttered a deceitful answer she was duly punished but if not, they had only complied with the command of the oracle.
καὶ πάλιν λέγει: Ἠγάπησαν αὐτὸν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν καὶ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτῶν ἐψεύσαντο αὐτόν, ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῶν οὐκ εὐθεῖα μετ̓ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ ἐπιστώθησαν ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ αὐτοῦ.	And again it says they loved him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongue, and their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.
ἐν δὲ τῷ μεταξὺ Λαμψάκου καὶ Παρίου Παισὸς ἦν πόλις καὶ ποταμός·	In the interval between Lampsacus and Parium was Psus, a city, and a river Psus.
τίς ποτ’ αἶσα, τίς ἄρα πότμος ἐπιμένει τὸν ἄλκιμον τᾶσδε γᾶς ἄνακτα;	What fate, what issue there awaits the valiant monarch of this land? Once more do we invoke the gods we called upon before
διὰ δὴ οὖν τὸ φιλογενναῖον ἐτιμᾶτο ἐν τῇ πόλει.	It was, then, for his love of what is noble that he was honoured in the state.
κατὰ μέρος γάρ, οὐχ ὁμοῦ πάντοθεν ἴσχυσαν ὑφάψαι τὰς στοάς.	for the soldiers were not able to burn all the cloisters that were round about together at one time, but only by pieces.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλ’ ἐπεὶ Φίλιππος ὑπὸ τῆς περὶ τὴν Ἄμφισσαν εὐτυχίας ἐπαιρόμενος εἰς τὴν Ἐλάτειαν ἐξαίφνης ἐνέπεσε καὶ τὴν Φωκίδα κατέσχεν, ἐκπεπληγμένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ μηδενὸς τολμῶντος ἀναβαίνειν ἐπὶ τὸ βῆμα μηδὲ ἔχοντος ὅ τι χρὴ λέγειν, ἀλλ’ ἀπορίας οὔσης ἐν μέσῳ καὶ σιωπῆς, παρελθὼν μόνος ὁ Δημοσθένης συνεβούλευε τῶν Θηβαίων ἔχεσθαι·	Philip, however, elated by his good-fortune in the matter of Amphissa, surprised Elateia and occupied Phocis. This step drove the Athenians out of their senses no one ventured to ascend the bema and no one knew what ought to be said, but perplexity and silence reigned in the assembly. Then it was that Demosthenes, and he alone, came forward and advised the people to cling to Thebes
τὸ δὲ πρὸς τὰς ἀναμνήσεις τε τοῦ πάθους καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ὀδυρμοὺς ἄγον καὶ ἀπλήστως ἔχον αὐτῶν ἆρ’ οὐκ ἀλόγιστόν τε φήσομεν εἶναι καὶ ἀργὸν καὶ δειλίας φίλον;	And shall we not say that the part of us that leads us to dwell in memory on our suffering and impels us to lamentation, and cannot get enough of that sort of thing, is the irrational and idle part of us, the associate of cowardice?
καὶ Ποπαίδιος, ἄλλος τῶν ἀφεστώτων στρατηγός, ἐνταῦθα ἔπεσεν·	Pompædius, one of the rebel generals, here lost his life.
ὥσπερ γὰρ ἵππος εὐγενής, κἂν ᾖ γέρων, ἐν τοῖσι δεινοῖς θυμὸν οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν, ἀλλ’ ὀρθὸν οὖς ἵστησιν, ὡσαύτως δὲ σὺ ἡμᾶς τ’ ὀτρύνεις καὐτὸς ἐν πρώτοις ἕπει.	Just as a thoroughbred mount, even if advanced in years, does not lose courage in danger, but pricks up his ears, so you speed us forward and follow in the first ranks.
ἐν δὲ τούτω τῷ χρόνῳ δέῃ πολλὰ καὶ κινδύνους ὁ θεὸς ἐπιπέμπει τοῖς ἀδικοῦσιν, ὥστε πολλοὺς ἤδη ἐπιθυμῆσαι τελευτήσαντας τῶν κακῶν ἀπηλλάχθαι.	But in the meantime the deity sends upon the wrongdoers many terrors and dangers, so that many men ere now have desired that their end had come and relieved them of their troubles by death.
ὥστε δῆλον ἐφ’ ὅσον συνάγεται τὰ ἄκρα τῆς οἰκουμένης κατὰ μῆκος ὑπὸ τοῦ περικεχυμένου πελάγους εἰς στενόν.	From this it appears to what a degree the extremities of the habitable earth are narrowed by the surrounding sea.
ἀλλ’ ὡς μὲν ὦφλεν, ἐνεβάλετο τηρήσας τὴν τελευταίαν ἡμέραν, ταύτην δ’ εἰς τὸν ὕστερον λόγον ὑπελίπετο, ὡς διαβαλεῖν τὸ πρᾶγμ’ ἐξ αὐτῆς δυνησόμενος.	He did introduce evidence that he became a state-debtor, but he waited until the last day, and kept this evidence for his second speech, thinking that by it he would be able to give a malicious turn to the matter. So, if he reads it, give close heed.
ὅτι καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἔκρυψας ἀπὸ φρονήσεως, διὰ τοῦτο οὐ μὴ ὑψώσῃς αὐτούς.	Since you hid their mind from wisdom, because of this, you will not raise them up.
νῆσοι δ’ εἰσὶν ἐνταῦθα ἥ τε Κόρκυρα καὶ Σύβοτα πρὸ τῆς Ἠπειρώτιδος, καὶ ἐφεξῆς πρὸ τοῦ Κορινθιακοῦ κόλπου Κεφαλληνία καὶ Ἰθάκη καὶ Ζάκυνθος καὶ Ἐχινάδες.	In this sea are the Islands of Corcyra and Sybota, opposite the coasts of Epirus and beyond these, opposite the Gulf of Corinth, Cephallenia, Ithaca, Zacynth, and the Echinades.
πολλάκις μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς φωνῆς ὁ τοῦ ἀέρος σάλος ἔναρθρον ἐᾷ πρὸς τὴν αἴσθησιν ἐξικνεῖσθαι καὶ διαμεμορφωμένον, ἀεὶ μέντοι τι τοῦ πλήθους φέρει καὶ τοῦ μεγέθους.	For often the disturbed air hinders the articulateness of a discourse from coming to the ears, though it may convey something of the loudness and length of it.
Ἀπὸ δὲ Ἀρταξέρξου μέχρι τοῦ καθ' ἡμᾶς χρόνου γέγραπται μὲν ἕκαστα, πίστεως δ' οὐχ ὁμοίας ἠξίωται τοῖς πρὸ αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ μὴ γενέσθαι τὴν τῶν προφητῶν ἀκριβῆ διαδοχήν.	It is true, our history since Artaxerxes has also been written but it is not esteemed as highly as the former, as there was no clear succession of prophets during that time.
εἰ γὰρ διὰ βρῶμα ὁ ἀδελφός σου λυπεῖται, οὐκέτι κατὰ ἀγάπην περιπατεῖς. μὴ τῷ βρώματί σου ἐκεῖνον ἀπόλλυε ὑπὲρ οὗ Χριστὸς ἀπέθανεν.	For if your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy by your food someone for whom Christ died.
διότι υἱὸς ἀτιμάζει πατέρα, θυγάτηρ ἐπαναστήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτῆς, νύμφη ἐπὶ τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς, ἐχθροὶ πάντες ἀνδρὸς οἱ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.	Because a son dishonors a father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a bride against her mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are all who are in his house.
γενομένων δὲ παίδων εὐτεκνοῦσαι καὶ πολυτεκνοῦσαι τὸ τῆς Καρμέντης ἱερὸν ἱδρύσαντο.	When children were born to them, they, as mothers of a fair and numerous progeny, founded the temple of Carmenta.
ἀλλὰ κἀνταῦθα πάλιν ἡ μὲν ἐκκριτικὴ δύναμις ἐναργής, οὐ μὴν ὁμοίως γ’ αὐτῇ σαφὴς τοῖς πολλοῖς ἡ ἑλκτική·	But in this latter case, again, whilst the eliminative faculty is evident, the attractive faculty is not so obvious to most people.
οὐκοῦν ὀρθῶς, ἔφην, ὦ Ἀδείμαντε;	Well, isn’t that right, Adeimantus?
Τότε λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Πάντες ὑμεῖς σκανδαλισθήσεσθε ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ· γέγραπται γάρ, Πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα, καὶ διασκορπισθήσεται τὰ πρόβατα τῆς ποίμνης.	Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the Shepherd, And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
ἀναλαβόντες ψαλτήριον καὶ κιθάραν καὶ εὐφραίνονται φωνῇ ψαλμοῦ.	taking up a harp and lyre, and they are cheered by the sound of a song.
ἀλλὰ κινῶ σε πρὸς φιλοσοφίαν;	But I must excite you to study philosophy.
τίθεται δ’ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ἆθλα δρόμου καὶ τῶν ἐν τοῖς πεντάθλοις.	The king gives rewards for running, and to the victors in the other contests of the pentathla (or five games).
Δίων δ’ ἀδεέστερον ἐν τῇ φυγῇ τοῦ φυγαδεύσαντος τυράννου καὶ ἥδιον διάγων ἀνέρριψεν ἑκὼν κίνδυνον τοσοῦτον ἐπὶ τῷ σῶσαι Σικελίαν.	whereas Dion was living with greater confidence and pleasure in his banishment than the tyrant who banished him, and yet of his own accord he hazarded a peril so great in order to save Sicily.
ἐπαινοῦντες τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν τὸ ἔθος τὸ γυμνοῦν τὰς παρθένους τοῖς ξένοις.	The fashion, too, of Sparta is much praised, I mean that of displaying their virgins naked to their guests
μέση γὰρ οὐδέποτε ληφθήσομαι.	never fear, i know how to use this tool.
κἄπειτα κραναΐνας Ῥάβδους τέσσαρας λαβὼν ἴσον τὸ μέγεθος ἀλλήλῃσιν ἐχούσας, πάχος μὲν ὡς δακτυλιαίας, μῆκος δὲ ὡς κεκαμμέναι ἐναρμόσωσιν ἐς τὰ ἀπαιωρήματα, ἐπιμελόμενος ὅκως τὰ ἄκρα τῶν Ῥάβδων μὴ ἐς τὸν χρῶτα, ἀλλ’ ἐς τὰ ἄκρα τῶν σφαιρέων ἐγκέλσει.	Then taking four rods, made of the cornel tree, of equal length, and of the thickness of a finger, and of such length that when bent they will admit of being adjusted to the appendages, care should be taken that the extremities of the rods bear not upon the skin, but on the extremities of the balls.
ᾧ δῆλός ἐστι σεσωσμένος καὶ διαπεφευγὼς τὸν κροκόδειλον ἂν γὰρ ἁρπασθῇ, μένει τὸ πτερὸν ὥσπερ ἔστη πεπηγός.	Which he plainly doth because he is now safe and escaped from the danger of the crocodile but if he chances to be catched, his feathers then continue stiff as before.

οἷσι δὲ δοτέον, καὶ οἷσιν οὐ δοτέον, τὰ μέγιστα εἴρηται, καὶ δι’ ἃ οὐ δοτέον Κατέγνωσται δὲ μελίκρητον ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὡς καταγυιοῖ τοὺς πίνοντας, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ταχυθάνατον εἶναι νενόμισται·	but in what instances it is to be given, and in what it is not to be given, and wherefore it is not to be given,- all this has been explained already, for the most part. Hydromel is generally condemned, as if it weakened the powers of those who drink it, and on that account it is supposed to accelerate death
καὶ τὸ μὲν καλῶς ἔχον ὅπως χρονίζον εὖ μενεῖ βουλευτέον·	Where all goes well, we must take counsel so that it may long endure
οὐκοῦν δεινὸν εἰ τῆς μὲν πόλεως καὶ τῶν ὑπ’ ἐκείνου καταλειφθέντων διὰ τοὔνομα τοῦτο μέτεστί σοι, τοῦτο δ’ ἀξιοῖς ἀφεὶς ἕτερον μεταθέσθαι σαυτῷ.	It is, then, an outrage that whereas thanks to that name you have a share in the right of citizenship and in the estate left by my father, you should see fit to fling it aside and take another name.

τούτων οὖν διαφόρως ἱστορουμένων λάβωμεν τὸν ἐλάχιστον ἀριθμὸν τὰ κγʹ ἔτη.	Now, as these all vary so much in their accounts, we will take the smallest number, and say twenty-three.
οὐκ ἔσται ὁ λόγος σου ψευδής, οὐ κενός, ἀλλὰ μεμεστωμένος πράξει.	Your message is not to be false or empty, but being filled with practice.
ἐπὶ δὲ νύσσης μιᾶς Ἱπποδαμείας ἐστὶν εἰκὼν χαλκῆ, ταινίαν τε ἔχουσα καὶ ἀναδεῖν τὸν Πέλοπα μέλλουσα ἐπὶ τῇ νίκῃ.	On one turning-post is a bronze statue of Hippodameia carrying a ribbon, and about to crown Pelops with it for his victory.
ταῦτα τῶν Αἰτωλῶν λεγόντων καὶ διαταραττόντων τοὺς συμμάχους, αὐτὸς ὁ Φίλιππος ἐλθὼν πρὸς τὰς διαλύσεις ἀνεῖλε τὴν ὑποψίαν, ἐπιτρέψας τῷ Τίτῳ καὶ Ῥωμαίοις τὰ καθ’ αὑτόν, καὶ οὕτω καταλύεται τὸν πόλεμον ὁ Τίτος·	While the Aetolians were making these charges and trying to make trouble among the Roman allies, Philip himself removed all grounds for suspicion by coming to terms and putting himself and his realm in the hands of Titus and the Romans. And in this manner Titus put an end to the war

ἐν αὐτῷ δὲ πόλις Ῥωσὸς καὶ Μυρίανδρος πόλις καὶ Ἀλεξάνδρεια καὶ Νικόπολις καὶ Μοψουεστία καὶ πύλαι λεγόμεναι, ὅριον Κιλίκων τε καὶ Σύρων.	The city Rhosus is situated upon it, as also the city Myriandrus, Alexandreia, Nicopolis, Mopsuestia, and the Gates, as they are called, which are the boundary between Cilicia and Syria.
καὶ μὴν παρών γε κοὐ λόγους ἄλλων κλύων, Πέρσαι, φράσαιμ᾽ ἂν οἷ᾽ ἐπορσύνθη κακά. ὀτοτοτοῖ, μάταν τὰ πολλὰ βέλεα παμμιγῆ γᾶς ἀπ᾽ Ἀσίδος ἦλθε δᾴ - αν ἐφ᾽ Ἑλλάδα χώραν. πλήθουσι νεκρῶν δυσπότμως ἐφθαρμένων Σαλαμῖνος ἀκταὶ πᾶς τε πρόσχωρος τόπος.	alas, alas! in vain did our vast and variously armed host go forth from the land of asia against the hostile soil of hellas. full of the bodies of men who perished by a miserable fate are the shores of salamis and all the neighboring coasts. alas, alas!

ὁ γὰρ Ἀφαρεὺς ἐξήλεγχεν αὐτὸν τιμὴν λογισάμενον αὑτῷ τῶν σκευῶν καὶ λαβόντα παρ’ αὑτοῦ, ὅτε παρελάμβανεν τὴν τριηραρχίαν.	For Aphareus proved that Theophemus had reckoned up against him the cost of the equipment and had got the money from him, when he took over the trierarchy.
ὁ γὰρ κιθαρῳδὸς ᾁδων εἰσάγεται νεῖκος Ὀδυσσῆος καὶ Πηλείδεω Ἀχιλῆος, ὥς ποτε δηρίσαντο. ἄναξ δ’ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων χαῖρε νόῳ ὣς γάρ οἱ χρείων μυθήσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων Πυθοῖ·	for the minstrel is introduced singing of the fierce contest of Ulysses, and Achilles, the son of Peleus, how once they contended together, and Agamemnon king of men was pleased, for so Phbus Apollo had foretold by the oracle in the illustrious Pytho.
οἱ δ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι ἄρκτοι τε πολλοὺς ἤδη πλησιάσαντας διέφθειραν καὶ κάπροι καὶ λέοντες καὶ παρδάλεις, αἱ δὲ ἔλαφοι καὶ δορκάδες καὶ οἱ ἄγριοι οἶες καὶ οἱ ὄνοι οἱ ἄγριοι ἀσινεῖς εἰσιν.	And they told him that bears and boars and lions and leopards had killed many who came close to them, but that deer and gazelles and wild sheep and wild asses were harmless.
τῶν δ’ ἄλλων παθῶν καὶ νοσημάτων τὰ μέν ἐστιν ἐπικίνδυνα τὰ δὲ μισητὰ τὰ δὲ καταγέλαστα, τῇ δ’ ἀδολεσχίᾳ πάντα συμβέβηκε.	Now of the other affections and maladies some are dangerous, some detestable, some ridiculous but garrulousness has all these qualities at once

καὶ θάμβος μέν, ἀτὰρ τοῦδε πλέον ἤνυσε θαῦμα πρόσθεν Πισαίου, ξεῖνε, θυηπολίου·	But he did still a greater feat than this, Before the altar of Olympian Jove
ὥστε ὅταν ἐπαινεῖν βούλῃ, ὅρα τί ἂν ὑπόθοιο·	Accordingly, if you desire to praise, look what you would suggest

ἐπειδὰν δὲ εὑρεθῇ, διώκεται.	As soon as the boar is found, he is pursued.
καὶ δῶρά γε ἢν διδῶσιν οἱ τοιοῦτοι, κἂν μείω τυγχάνῃ ὄντα ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν ὁμοίων, ὅμως μείζονος αὐτὰ τιμῶνται οἱ λαμβάνοντες.	And if such persons give presents, even though the gifts be of less worth than those given by equals, still the recipients value them more highly.
μίαν μὲν πόλιν εἰ ἀπώλεσεν ἢ ναῦς δέκα μόνας, περὶ προδοσίας ἂν αὐτὸν εἰσήγγελλον οὗτοι, καὶ εἰ ἑάλω, τὸν ἅπαντ’ ἂν ἀπωλώλει χρόνον·	Had he lost a single city or as few as ten ships, Leptines and his supporters would have impeached him for high treason, and if he had been convicted, he would have been a ruined man for ever.
ἐπεὶ δὲ Θησεὺς ἀπεδείχθη διάδοχος, χαλεπῶς φέροντες εἰ βασιλεύει μὲν Αἰγεὺς θετὸς γενόμενος Πανδίονι καὶ μηδὲν Ἐρεχθείδαις προσήκων, βασιλεύσει δ’ ὁ Θησεὺς πάλιν ἔπηλυς ὢν καὶ ξένος, εἰς πόλεμον καθίσταντο.	But when Theseus was declared successor to the throne, exasperated that Aegeus should be king although he was only an adopted son of Pandion and in no way related to the family of Erechtheus, and again that Theseus should be prospective king although he was an immigrant and a stranger, they went to war.
μή νυν τὸ λοιπόν, ἀλλὰ τήνδε μὲν καλεῖν ἀλεκτρύαιναν τουτονὶ δ’ ἀλέκτορα.	Do not do so, then, for the future but call this alektryaina, and this one alektor.
Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πάλιν εἰς Καπερναοὺμ δι' ἡμερῶν· καὶ ἠκούσθη ὅτι εἰς οἶκόν ἐστιν.	And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house.
ἔστιν δὲ οὐ ταὐτόν, ὦ Πρωταγόρα, ὥς φησιν Πρόδικος ὅδε, τὸ εἶναι καὶ τὸ γενέσθαι.	Now being and becoming, Protagoras, as our friend Prodicus says, are not the same thing
οὐ γὰρ ἴσμεν ὅστις ἦν ὁ δεκάσας πρῶτος ἐν Ῥώμῃ δῆμον ἢ δικαστήριον·	For we do not know who was the first man to bribe her people or her courts of law
ἀλλ᾽ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τελέεσθαι ὀΐω:	One thing I will tell you, and I think this will be brought to pass
βιοτεύειν δὲ χρὴ ἐν χώρῃσι θερμῇσι, ξηρῇσι. ψυχρὸν γὰρ, καὶ ὑγρὸν, ἡ νοῦσος.	The patients ought to reside in hot and dry places, for the disease is of a cold and humid nature.
ἀλλ’, ὦ Πρώταρχε, ἆρ’ οὐ διττὰς αὖ καὶ ταύτας λεκτέον;	But, Protarchus, ought not these to be divided into two kinds?
σκορπίοι δὲ οἱ πελάγιοι καὶ κιρροὶ τροφιμώτεροι τῶν τεναγωδῶν τῶν ἐν τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς τῶν μεγάλων.	and the sea-scorpions, which are found in the deep sea, and are of a tawny colour, are more nutritious than those which are found in marshes, or than the large ones which are taken on the shores.
πρὸς δὲ τὸν θαυμάζοντα, διότι τὸν γεγαμηκότα ἀπεῖρξε μὴ συγκοιμᾶσθαι τῇ γεγαμημένῃ, προσέταξε δὲ τὸ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας; συνεῖναι τοῖς ἡλικιώταις καὶ τὰς νύκτας ὅλας συναναπαύεσθαι, τῇ δὲ νύμφῃ κρύφα καὶ μετ’ εὐλαβείας συνεῖναι, ὅπως ἔφη καὶ τοῖς σώμασιν ἰσχυροὶ ὦσι διακορεῖς μὴ γινόμενοι, καὶ τῷ φιλεῖν ἀεὶ καινοὶ ὑπάρχωσι καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα ἐρρωμενέστερα παρέχωσι.	And to one wondering why he would not suffer the husband to lie all night with his wife, but commanded them to be most of the day and all the night with their fellows, and creep to their wives cautiously and by stealth, he said I do it that they may be strong in body, having never been satiated and surfeited with pleasure that they may be always fresh in love, and their children more strong and lusty.
δῆλον δὴ ὅτι τοὺς φρονιμωτέρους, φαίην ἄν.	The wise, obviously, I should say.
οὐ λήμψεσθε λύτρα τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς πόλιν φυγαδευτηρίων, τοῦ πάλιν κατοικεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἕως ἂν ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας.	You will not accept a ransom price from a fugitive who is in a city of refuge to again settle on the land, until the high priest dies.
εἶτα ὁ τῶν ἀκμαζόντων ἀνδρῶν ἀμειβόμενος, ἁμὲς δέ γ’ εἰμές·	Then the choir of men in the prime of life would sing in response, And that are we
δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν βασιλεύειν ἄχρι οὗ θῇ πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ.	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
ἐγκρατὴς δὲ τούτων γενόμενος τῶν χωρίων πρᾶγμ’ ἔπαθεν τοιοῦτον οἷον οὐχ ὅτι στρατηγὸς ἂν τις εἶναι φάσκων, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ὁ τυχὼν ἄνθρωπος.	Having taken possession of these strongholds, he had a misadventure into which even an ordinary person, not to say a man calling himself a commander, could never have blundered.
οὐ χρείαν ἔχει σοφίας ἐνδεὴς φρενῶν, μᾶλλον γὰρ ἄγεται ἀφροσύνῃ.	One lacking understanding has no need of wisdom, for rather he is led by folly.
Ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐμάθετε τὸν χριστόν,	But you have not so learned Christ,
πλεῖστον διεψεύσμεθα τῆς ἀληθείας.	But in fact, we have been completely misled as to the truth
γνόντες δὲ τῇ δευτέρᾳ διὰ τῶν προνομευόντων ὅτι σύνεγγύς εἰσιν ἀλλήλων, τότε μὲν αὐτοῦ καταστρατοπεδεύσαντες ἔμειναν.	and having ascertained on the second day, by means of scouts, that they were near each other, they both halted and remained encamped for that day
ὁ δὲ ποτάμιος κορακῖνος, ὃν πέλτην τινὲς καλοῦσιν, ὁ ἀπὸ τοῦ Νείλου, ὃν οἱ κατὰ τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρειαν ἰδίως ἡμίνηρον ὀνομάζουσιν, ὑποπίμελος μέν ἐστι καὶ ἥκιστα κακόχυλος, σαρκώδης, τρόφιμος, εὔπεπτος, εὐανάδοτος, κατὰ πάντα τοῦ μύλλου κρείσσων.	But the river coracinus, which some people call the peltes, the one from the Nile, I mean, which the people at Alexandria have a peculiar name for, and call the heminerus, is rather fat, and has a juice which is far from disagreeable it is fleshy, nutritious, easily digestible, not apt to disagree with one, and in every respect superior to the mullet.
οὐ τᾷδ’ οὔ; οὐ τᾷδε νεμῇ κλιτὺν δροσεράν;	wilt thou not browse here, here on the dewy slope? Ho? ho!
ἵν’ ἕκαστος ἡμῶν τὰς ἐκ τῶν νόμων ζημίας φοβούμενος μᾶλλον ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους, ἀμείνων ἀγωνιστὴς ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος ὑπάρχῃ·	In order that each man of us, fearing the punishment of the laws more than he fears the enemy, may become a better champion of his country.
Ἀλκιβιάδης δὲ οὐκ ἔφη χρῆναι τοσαύτῃ δυνάμει ἐκπλεύσαντας αἰσχρῶς καὶ ἀπράκτους ἀπελθεῖν, ἀλλ’ ἔς τε τὰς πόλεις ἐπικηρυκεύεσθαι πλὴν Σελινοῦντος καὶ Συρακουσῶν τὰς ἄλλας, καὶ πειρᾶσθαι καὶ τοὺς Σικελοὺς τοὺς μὲν ἀφιστάναι ἀπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων, τοὺς δὲ φίλους ποιεῖσθαι, ἵνα σῖτον καὶ στρατιὰν ἔχωσι, πρῶτον δὲ πείθειν Μεσσηνίους ἐν πόρῳ γὰρ μάλιστα καὶ προσβολῇ εἶναι αὐτοὺς τῆς Σικελίας, καὶ λιμένα καὶ ἐφόρμησιν τῇ στρατιᾷ ἱκανωτάτην ἔσεσθαι·	Alcibiades said that a great expedition like the present must not disgrace itself by going away without having done anything heralds must be sent to all the cities except Selinus and Syracuse, and efforts be made to make some of the Sicels revolt from the Syracusans, and to obtain the friendship of others, in order to have corn and troops and first of all to gain the Messinese, who lay right in the passage and entrance to Sicily, and would afford an excellent harbour and base for the army.
καὶ ἐγένετο Κύριος καταφυγὴ τῷ πένητι, βοηθὸς ἐν εὐκαιρίαις ἐν θλίψει.	And the Lord became a place of refuge for the poor, a helper in the times in affliction.
οὗτοι δὲ καὶ τὰ τιμήματα τῶν οὐσιῶν λαμβάνοντες ἐπεσκόπουν, καὶ ταῖς ἀπογραφαῖς τὰ γένη καὶ τὰς πολιτείας διέκρινον·	They also revised the assessments of property, and arranged the citizens in lists according to their social and political classes.
ἄκραντ’ ὀδύρῃ ταῖσδέ τ’ ἐξάγεις δάκρυ.	’Tis vain to weep and move to tears these women.
εὐίατός τε γάρ ἐστι καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς ἡλικίας καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς ἀπορίας, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ μέσον δύναται ἐλθεῖν. ἔχει γὰρ τὰ τοῦ ἐλευθερίου· καὶ γὰρ δίδωσι καὶ οὐ λαμβάνει, οὐδέτερον δ’ ὡς δεῖ οὐδ’ εὖ.	for he is easily cured by age or by poverty, and is able to be brought to the due mean, because he possesses the essentials of the liberal characterhe gives, and he refrains from taking, though he does neither in the proper way or rightly.
πορφύραν, νυνὶ δὲ καὶ ταυτὶ τὰ τρίβοντα τὴν ὤχραν παιδάρια καταγελᾷ σου φλυαροῦντος.	but now, since thou art frivolous, thou exposest thyself to the laughter even of my boys that mix the colors.
Πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη.	"I have come to bring fire on the earth and how I wish it were already kindled!
καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τὸ ἐν αὐτῇ πλούσιον σφόδρα, καὶ ἐκεῖ καλύμματα χρυσᾶ, καὶ θώρακες καὶ ὅπλα, ἃ κατέλειπεν ἐκεῖ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ τοῦ Φιλίππου ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ Μακεδών, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν τοῖς Ἕλλησι πρῶτος.	And the temple in it was extremely rich, and there was golden armor and breastplates and weapons, which Alexander the son of Philip, the king of Macedonia, left behind there—he first ruled the Greeks.
τέχνην δὲ αὐτὴν οὔ φημι εἶναι ἀλλ’ ἐμπειρίαν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔχει λόγον οὐδένα ᾧ προσφέρει ἃ προσφέρει ὁποῖ’ ἄττα τὴν φύσιν ἐστίν, ὥστε τὴν αἰτίαν ἑκάστου μὴ ἔχειν εἰπεῖν.	and I say it is not an art, but a habitude, since it has no account to give of the real nature of the things it applies, and so cannot tell the cause of any of them.
εἰ μὲν ἀγαθὰ ταῦτά ἐστι, χαίρειν σε δεῖ, ὅτι ἔτυχεν αὐτῶν ἐκεῖνος·	If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he. has them
μόνη δ’ ἡ γερουσία προύπεμψεν αὐτὸν καὶ ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς Ἐλεάζαρος καὶ ὁ στρατηγὸς Ἰησοῦς.	All those who accompanied him were the senate, and Eleazar the high priest, and Joshua their commander.
ταύτην τοιαύτην εἶπον, ὡς δηχθῇ λεώς, ὅσπερ τέτακται τήνδε κυρῶσαι δίκην.	As for that woman, I have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case.
ἀλλὰ θυγάτηρ ἡ Ταρπηία τοῦ ἄρχοντος οὖσα προὔδωκε τοῖς Σαβίνοις, ἐπιθυμήσασα τῶν χρυσῶν βραχιονιστήρων οὓς εἶδε περικειμένους, καὶ ᾔτησε μισθὸν τῆς προδοσίας ἃ φοροῖεν ἐν ταῖς ἀριστεραῖς χερσί.	But Tarpeia, a daughter of the commander, betrayed the citadel to the Sabines, having set her heart on the golden armlets which she saw them wearing, and she asked as payment for her treachery that which they wore on their left arms.
καὶ ὁπότε τις ἐρωτῴη αὐτὴν τίνι γαμοῖτο, ἔλεγεν ὅτι Κύρῳ·	And whenever anybody asked her whom she was going to marry, she would say Cyrus.
φαγὼν δὲ καὶ συλλεξάμενος ἐκ τῆς τροφῆς ἐκείνης τὴν δύναμιν εἰς τὸ Σιναῖον καλούμενον ὄρος παραγίνεται, οὗ Μωυσῆς τοὺς νόμους παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ λέγεται λαβεῖν.	so when he had eaten, and recovered his strength by that his food, he came to that mountain which is called Sinai, where it is related that Moses received his laws from God
περισπῶσι δ’ οἱ Ἀττικοὶ παρὰ τὸν ὀρθὸν λόγον τοὔνομα.	And the Attic writers circumflex the noun in a manner quite contrary to analogy.
δίδωμι δ’ ὑμῖν, τὰ ὅπλα καταθεῖσιν, ἀπαθέσιν ἀπιέναι.	Nevertheless, if you will lay down your arms, I will allow you to go unpunished."
οὐκ ἐσθῆτα ἔχεις ἣν δεῖ τὸν ἱεροφάντην, οὐ κόμην, οὐ στρόφιον οἷον δεῖ, οὐ φωνήν, οὐχ ἡλικίαν, οὐχ ἥγνευκας ὡς ἐκεῖνος, ἀλλ’ αὐτὰς μόνας τὰς φωνὰς ἀνειληφὼς λέγεις. ἱεραί εἰσιν αἱ φωναὶ αὐταὶ καθ’ αὑτάς;	you have not the garments which the hierophant ought to have, nor the hair, nor the headdress, nor the voice, nor the age nor have you purified yourself as he has but you have committed to memory the words only, and you say, Sacred are the words by themselves.
ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ μὴ ἔχων τις ψέγοιτο ἄν, εἰ ὃ ῥᾴδιον ἢ ἀναγκαῖον ἦν, μὴ ἔχει δι’ ἀμέλειαν ἢ ἡδονὴν ἢ λύπην.	And similarly one would be blamed for not having the knowledge, if it were something that was easy or necessary and his not having it is due to carelessness or pleasure or pain.
πυθόμενος δ’ ἐγκαλεῖν αὐτῷ τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον, ὅτι παῖδας ἐκ πλειόνων ποιεῖται γυναικῶν, οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, πολλοὺς ἔχων περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἀνταγωνιστὰς γενοῦ καλὸς κἀγαθός, ἵνα μὴ δι’ ἐμὲ τῆς βασιλείας τύχῃς ἀλλὰ διὰ σεαυτόν.	Learning that Alexander complained against him because he was having children by other women besides his wife, he said, Well then, if you have many competitors for the kingdom, prove yourself honourable and good, so that you may obtain the kingdom not because of me, but because of yourself.
ἀλλ’, ὦ μακάριε, φήσει, γενναιοτέρως ἐπ’ αὐτὸ ἐλθὼν ὃ λέγω, εἰ δύνασαι, ἐξέλεγξον ὡς οὐχὶ ἴδιαι αἰσθήσεις ἑκάστῳ ἡμῶν γίγνονται, ἢ ὡς ἰδίων γιγνομένων οὐδέν τι ἂν μᾶλλον τὸ φαινόμενον μόνῳ ἐκείνῳ γίγνοιτο, ἢ εἰ εἶναι δεῖ ὀνομάζειν, εἴη ᾧπερ φαίνεται·	But, my dear fellow, he will say, attack my real doctrines in a more generous manner, and prove, if you can, that perceptions, when they come, or become, to each of us, are not individual, or that, if they are individual, what appears to each one would not, for all that, become to that one alone—or, if you prefer to say be, would not be—to whom it appears.
κλῶπες οἵτινες κατ’ ὄρφνην τόνδε κινοῦσι στρατόν.	There are the thieves who in the gloom disturbed this army.
κεἰ μὴ θέλοι, πυρωπὸν ἐκ Διὸς μολεῖν κεραυνόν, ὃς πᾶν ἐξαϊστώσοι γένος.	and, if he would not, a fiery thunderbolt would come from Zeus that would utterly destroy his whole race.
οὗτοί τε δὴ τηνικαῦτα ἐν τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ἐδυνάστευον καὶ Δαμασίας ὁ Πενθίλου τοῦ Ὀρέστου, τοῖς Τισαμενοῦ παισὶν ἀνεψιὸς πρὸς πατρός.	These then at the time held sway among the Achaeans along with Damasias, the son of Penthilus, the son of Orestes, who on his father's side was cousin to the sons of Tisamenus.
πρέποντα τῇ τιμῇ τοῦτον συνίστημι.	I recommend him to thee, as one that is fit for this dignity."
τούς τε τὰ πρώϊμα πολλοῦ ἐωνημένους ἀπογινώσκειν ἔλεγεν εἰς τὰς ὥρας ἐλθεῖν.	He said that, when people paid a high price for fruit which had ripened early, they must despair of seeing the fruit ripen at the proper season.
ἀλλ’ ὧν μὲν ὁ πατὴρ διαβέβληται εἰς ὑμᾶς, δικαίως τούτων δεῖ ἡμᾶς ἕνεκα ἀπολέσθαι, ὧν δὲ πρόθυμοι εἰς τὴν πόλιν γεγενήμεθα, μηδεμίαν ὠφέλειαν γενέσθαι;	Is our destruction to be justified by the slanders by which my father has been traduced to you, and are we to reap no benefit from the zeal that we have shown in the city’s service?
παρέχει δ’ ἀπορίαν καὶ τὸ πᾶσαν μὲν ἐπιστήμην εἶναι τῶν καθόλου καὶ τοῦ τοιουδί, τὴν δ’ οὐσίαν μὴ τῶν καθόλου εἶναι, μᾶλλον δὲ τόδε τι καὶ χωριστόν, ὥστ’ εἰ περὶ τὰς ἀρχάς ἐστιν ἐπιστήμη, πῶς δεῖ τὴν ἀρχὴν ὑπολαβεῖν οὐσίαν εἶναι;	It is a perplexing fact also that whereas every science treats of universals and types, substance is not a universal thing, but rather a particular and separable thing so that if there is a science that deals with first principles, how can we suppose that substance is a first principle?
δοκεῖ οὖν σοι ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι τὸν περὶ τούτων τι ἐπιστήμονα ὄντα ἄρα καὶ ἄνδρα φρόνιμον εἶναι, ἢ πολλοῦ φήσομεν ἐνδεῖν;	Then do you think it inevitable that he who has some knowledge about these things should also be a wise man, or shall we say he comes far short of it?
ἐν δὲ τῷ κόσμῳ μηδὲν εἶναι κενόν, ἀλλ’ ἡνῶσθαι αὐτόν·	The world has no empty space within it, but forms one united whole.
Ὅτε οὖν ἠρίστησαν, λέγει τῷ Σίμωνι Πέτρῳ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Σίμων Ἰωνᾶ, ἀγαπᾷς με πλεῖον τούτων; Λέγει αὐτῷ, Ναὶ κύριε· σὺ οἶδας ὅτι φιλῶ σε. Λέγει αὐτῷ, Βόσκε τὰ ἀρνία μου.	So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?" He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He said to him, "Feed My lambs."
οὐ φημὶ τὸν Ὀρέστην κατελθεῖν οἴκαδε· λάθρᾳ γὰρ ἦλθεν οὐ πιθὼν τοὺς κυρίους.	i deny orestes returned home, for he came secretly, without permission of the authorities.
ἐλθόντων δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τούς τε πρέσβεις ὡς νεωτερίζοντας ξυλλαβόντες, καὶ ὅσους ἔπεισαν, κατέθεντο ἐς Αἴγιναν.	Upon the arrival of the embassy the Athenians arrested the envoys and all who listened to them, as revolutionists, and lodged them in Aegina.
ὅτι δ’ ἐστὶ θεωρητική, εἴρηται.	and it has been stated already that this activity is the activity of contemplation.
εἰς γὰρ τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον αὐτὰς περιποιησάμενοι, κοινὰς χάριτας ὑμᾶς ἀπαιτοῦσιν.	For having performed the services for the advancement of their own families, they are now asking you for public token of thanks.
ἅμα μὲν γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ χῶρος ἐπιτήδειος ἐφαίνετο ἐνστρατοπεδεῦσαι, ἅμα δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀχαρνῆς μέγα μέρος ὄντες τῆς πόλεως τρισχίλιοι γὰρ ὁπλῖται ἐγένοντο οὐ περιόψεσθαι ἐδόκουν τὰ σφέτερα διαφθαρέντα, ἀλλ’ ὁρμήσειν καὶ τοὺς πάντας ἐς μάχην.	Besides, the place seemed unto him commodious for the army to lie in and it was thought also that the Acharnans, being a great piece of the city (for they were three thousand men of arms), would not have suffered the spoiling of their lands, but rather have urged the rest to go out and fight.
ἐκεῖνος μὲν οὖν ταῦθ’ ὑφηγήσατο, ἐγὼ δὲ ἥκω οὐ μικρολογησόμενος οὐδὲ περὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων μαχούμενος.	The project of it, then, was his and so I have not come here to talk trivialities or to wrangle over words
φιλίαν τε καὶ συμμαχίαν ἡμῖν προφέρουσιν, ὥσπερ οὐκ ἐγκαλοῦσιν ἀλλ’ ἐγκαλουμένοις ἀπεκρίνασθε μὴ νομίζειν συμφέρειν τοῖς Ῥωμαίων πράγμασι βλάπτεσθαι Νικομήδη οἷάπερ αὐτὸν ἀδικούμενον.	And when we appealed to your friendship and alliance you answered as though we were not the accusers but the accused, saying that it would not be for your interest that harm should come to Nicomedes, as though he were the injured one.
ὁμοῦ δὲ τούτων πάντων ἀγωνιζομένων ἄλεκτον ἦν τὸ συμβαῖνον. περὶ δὲ τῶν τραγῳδῶν, φησὶν ὁ Πολύβιος, ὅ,τι ἂν ἐπιβάλωμαι λέγειν, δόξω τισὶ διαχλευάζειν.	and cannot believe that those they meet can understand or fully see that they are really released, unless they do something strange and out of the ordinary course.
δεῖ δέ γε οὔχ, ὡς ἄρτι ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος ἐσήμαινεν· ᾧ πειστέον, ἕως ἄν τις ἡμᾶς ἄλλῳ καλλίονι πείσῃ.	But that must not be, as our reasoning but now showed us, in which we must put our trust until someone convinces with a better reason.
καὶ μετεπέμποντο τοὺς ἄλλους ἡγεμόνας καὶ παρήγγελλον ἐν κόσμῳ τὸν στρατὸν ἔχειν, ὡς μάχης ἐσομένης.	Then they summoned the other leaders and gave them orders to keep the army in array, since there was to be a battle.
Καὶ ἰδού, ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ᾧ ὄνομα Συμεών, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος δίκαιος καὶ εὐλαβής, προσδεχόμενος παράκλησιν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πνεῦμα ἦν ἅγιον ἐπ' αὐτόν.	And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
ἢ πένθους μὲν οἰκεῖον τὸ μὴ σύνηθες, συνηθέστερον δὲ ταῖς μὲν γυναιξὶν ἐγκεκαλυμμέναις, τοῖς δ’ ἀνδράσιν ἀκαλύπτοις εἰς τὸ δημόσιον προϊέναι;	Or is it that what is not the fashion is fit for mourning? For it is more customary for women to appear publicly with covered heads, and for men with uncovered.
δεσμεύουσιν δὲ φορτία βαρέα καὶ δυσβάστακτα καὶ ἐπιτιθέασιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους τῶν ἀνθρώπων· αὐτοὶ δὲ τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτῶν οὐ θέλουσιν κινῆσαι αὐτά.	They tie up heavy loads, hard to carry, and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing even to lift a finger to move them.
Περὶ τῶν οὐχ ἁπλῶν ἀξιωμάτων α′.	Of Judgements which are not Simple, one book.
μειρακίου γοῦν καταθρασυνομένου εἶπε μὲν οὐδέν· λαβὼν δὲ κάρφος διέγραφεν εἰς τοὔδαφος περαινομένου σχῆμα· ἕως ὁρώντων πάντων συνὲν τὸ μειράκιον τὴν ὕβριν ἀπηλλάγη.	When a young gallant would have taken liberties with him, he said not a word but picked up a twig and drew an insulting picture on the ground, until all eyes were attracted and the young man, perceiving the insult, made off.
μετὰ δὲ Ἑλίκην ἀποτραπήσῃ τε ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἐς δεξιὰν καὶ ἥξεις ἐς πόλισμα Κερύνειαν·	After Helice you will turn from the sea to the right and you will come to the town of Ceryneia.
παντὶ μὲν τὸ θερμὸν ἐς πέψιν, παντὶ δὲ ὑγρῶν γέννα καὶ διάκρισις, ἄλλων μὲν ἄλλη, ἑκάστῳ δὲ οἰκείη·	in every part there is heat for concoction in every part for the creation and secretion of humours, different in different places, but in each that which is peculiar to it
μὴ ἐξύψου σεαυτόν, ἵνα μὴ πέσῃς καὶ ἐπαγάγῃς τῇ ψυχῇ σου ἀτιμίαν, καὶ ἀποκαλύψει Κύριος τὰ κρυπτά σου, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ συναγωγῆς καταβαλεῖ σε, ὅτι οὐ προσῆλθες φόβῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἡ καρδία σου πλήρης δόλου.	Do not exalt yourself lest you fall and bring dishonor onto your soul, and the Lord will uncover your secrets, and he will throw you down in the midst of the congregation because you did not come in the fear of the Lord, and your heart was full of deceit.
ἀπερχομένων δὲ αὐτῶν ἀγοράσαι ἦλθεν ὁ νυμφίος, καὶ αἱ ἕτοιμοι εἰσῆλθον μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς γάμους, καὶ ἐκλείσθη ἡ θύρα.	But while they had gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.
γράμματα διδάσκων, καὶ παιδαγωγῶν, καὶ θυρωρῶν, πλέων, παραπλέων οὐδέν ἐστι τούτων αἴσχιον οὐδὲ δυσχερέστερον τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι ἀπόδος.	Live by teaching letters, by leading children to school, by being a door-keeper, by working as a sailor or a boatman none of these is so disgraceful or disagreeable as hearing the order Pay up.
ἐπεὶ δὲ συνηγόρευον μὲν πολλοὶ ὡς χρεὼν εἴη ὅτι τάχιστα πορεύεσθαι ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους, ἀντέλεγε δὲ οὐδείς, ἐκ τούτου δὴ ὁ Κῦρος ἤρχετο λόγου τοιοῦδε.	Many supported him, saying that it was expedient to proceed as soon as possible against the enemy, and no one opposed his plan so Cyrus began to speak as follows
πυθομένου δὲ τοῦ νεανίσκου, εἰ νοσήσας ἀξιοῦντος φίλου πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν ὥστε νοσοκομηθῆναι ὑπακούσει, Ποῦ δὲ φίλον μοι δώσεις Κυνικοῦ;	-The same young man inquiring whether, if a friend should desire to come to him and take care of him when he was sick, he should comply? And where, says Epictetus, will you find me the friend of a Cynic?
τὸ δ’ ἄρτιον ἐνδεὲς καὶ ἀτελὲς καὶ ἀόριστον, ὥσπερ αὖ τὸ περιττὸν ὥρισται καὶ περαίνει καὶ τέλειόν ἐστι.	But an even number is defective, imperfect, and indefinite as again an odd number is determinate, definite, and complete.
σοφίας δὲ μέχρι καὶ νῦν ἱερὸν οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδὲ σωφροσύνης; ἢ καρτερίας ἢ μεγαλοψυχίας ἢ ἐγκρατείας·	And to this very day there is no temple built to Wisdom, nor to Temperance, Patience, Magnanimity, or Continence.
ἀφεκτέον οὖν τῷ πρὸς ὀργὴν φαύλως ἔχοντι τῶν σπανίων καὶ περιττῶν, οἷον ἐκπωμάτων καὶ σφραγίδων καὶ λίθων πολυτελῶν·	And therefore he that is prone to be angry should refrain from such things as are rare and curiously wrought, such as cups and seals and precious stones
Ἡμῖν δὲ τοῖς πεισθεῖσιν ἐξ ἀρχῆς τεθῆναι τὸν νόμον κατὰ θεοῦ βούλησιν οὐδ᾽ εὐσεβὲς ἦν τοῦτον μὴ φυλάττειν· τί γὰρ αὐτοῦ τις ἂν μετακινήσειεν ἢ τί κάλλιον ἐξεῦρεν ἢ τί παρ᾽ ἑτέρων ὡς ἄμεινον μετήνεγκεν; ἆρά γε τὴν ὅλην κατάστασιν τοῦ πολιτεύματος;	Since we are convinced that our laws are in accord with God's will, it would be impious for us not to observe them, for what is there in them that one would change? What can be found to be better? Or what can we take from other people's laws that will excel them? Would one want to change our entire system of orde?
ὅτε δὲ ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὴν Λακωνικὴν καὶ ἐδόκουν ἅπαντες ἀπολεῖσθαι, εἶπε δὲ πρός τινα τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν, τί νῦν ποιήσετε, ὦ Λάκωνες;	When he invaded the Spartans’ country, and all thought that they should be destroyed, he said to one of the Spartans, What shall you do now, men of Sparta?
οὐ προσθήσομεν αὐτόσε τὸ δικαίως, ἀδίκως δὲ μή;	shall we not add to that—justly, not unjustly?
οἳ δ’ ἐς πρύμνην ἐφόβηθεν, ἀμφὶ κυβερνήτην δὲ σαόφρονα θυμὸν ἔχοντα ἔσταν ἄρ’ ἐκπληγέντες· ὃ δ’ ἐξαπίνης ἐπορούσας ἀρχὸν ἕλ’, οἳ δὲ θύραζε κακὸν μόρον ἐξαλύοντες πάντες ὁμῶς πήδησαν, ἐπεὶ ἴδον, εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, δελφῖνες δ’ ἐγένοντο·	And so the sailors fled into the stern and crowded bemused about the right-minded helmsman, until suddenly the lion sprang upon the master and seized him and when the sailors saw it they leapt out overboard one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate, and were changed into dolphins.
οὐ γὰρ χρῆται αὐτῇ, ἀλλ’ ὁρᾷ ὅπως γένηται·	Medical science does not control health, but studies how to procure it
τοὺς δὲ πλείους ἀκρασίας καὶ μαλακίας συνήγορον ἔχουσα παροιμίαν ἐλπὶς ἀναπείθει καὶ προάγεται βαδίζειν ἀναστάντας ἰταμῶς ἐπὶ τὴν συνήθειαν, ὡς οἴνῳ δὴ τὸν οἶνον κραιπάλῃ δὲ τὴν κραιπάλην ἐξελῶντας καὶ διαφορήσοντας.	Intemperance and effeminacy make many fly for patronage to the proverb, Wine is best after wine, and one debauch is the way to drive out another. This excites their hopes, and persuades and urges them to rise from their beds and rashly to fall to their wonted excesses.
τάς τε κοιλίας ξηροτάτας καὶ τὰς ἄνω καὶ τὰς κάτω ἔχειν, ὥστε τῶν φαρμάκων ἰσχυροτέρων δέεσθαι.	Their digestive organs, upper and lower, are very dry and very hot, so that they need more powerful drugs.
Εἰ δὲ θέλων ὁ θεὸς ἐνδείξασθαι τὴν ὀργὴν καὶ γνωρίσαι τὸ δυνατὸν αὐτοῦ ἤνεγκεν ἐν πολλῇ μακροθυμίᾳ σκεύη ὀργῆς κατηρτισμένα εἰς ἀπώλειαν,	But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction?
ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις δισχίλιοι ξυστοφόροι· ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις ἱππεῖς οἱ πρῶτοι γενόμενοι μύριοι, εἰς ἑκατὸν πανταχῇ τεταγμένοι·	Behind these came two thousand spearmen, and after them the original ten thousand Persian cavalry, drawn up in a square with a hundred on each side
ἄν σοι μὴ λυσιτελῇ, ἡ θύρα ἤνοικται·	If this does not satisfy (please) you, the door is open
ὥστε τὴν τυραννίδα χειρίστην οὖσαν πλεῖστον ἀπέχειν πολιτείας, δεύτερον δὲ τὴν ὀλιγαρχίαν ἡ γὰρ ἀριστοκρατία διέστηκεν ἀπὸ ταύτης πολὺ τῆς πολιτείασ̓, μετριωτάτην δὲ τὴν δημοκρατίαν.	so that tyranny being the worst form must be the one farthest removed from constitutional government, and oligarchy must be the second farthest (for aristocracy is widely separated from that constitution), while democracy must be the most moderate.
ἔπειτα ἐνίζειν ὕδατι ἀρτεμισίης , ἐλελισφάκου, κονύζης ἑψήματι ·	Then the patient is to have a sitz bath medicated with worm-wood, and the decoction of sage, and of flea-bane.
συλληφθεὶς δὲ πρὸς τῶν πέριξ δέσμιος ἤχθη πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.	He was arrested by the bystanders and led in bonds to the king.
εἰ δὲ μὴ κατέσχον, οὐδὲν ἧττον τό γ’ ἐκείνων πεποιῆσθαι.	though if they might not have succeeded, none the less their best efforts had been exerted.
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ὁ ἐν τῷ Πρωταγόρᾳ διάλογος, μετὰ τὴν Ἱππονίκου τελευτὴν γενόμενος παρειληφότος ἤδη τὴν οὐσίαν Καλλίου, τοῦ Πρωταγόρου μέμνηται παραγεγονότος τὸ δεύτερον οὐ πολλαῖς πρότερον ἡμέραις .	But the dialogue in the Protagoras, which took place after the death of Hipponicus, when Callias had entered upon his patrimonial inheritance, says that Protagoras had arrived in Athens for the second time not many days previously.
ἐθνῶν τε ἐκράτησαν ἀπὸ Μακεδονίας μέχρι Εὐφράτου·	They brought under their sway all the nations from Macedonia to the Euphrates.
δεινὸν δὲ ναυσὶν ἀρτίως πόντου σάλον παύσαντ’ ἀφίγμεθ’ Ἄργος, ὡς ἐσείδομεν σφαγὰς ἀδελφῆς τῆσδε, μητέρος δὲ σῆς.	Having just now calmed the swell of the sea, terrible for ships, we have come to Argos when we saw the slaying of our sister, your mother.
’ οἱ μὲν οὖν Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοσαῦτα εἶπον, νομίζοντες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐν τῷ πρὶν χρόνῳ σπονδῶν μὲν ἐπιθυμεῖν, σφῶν δὲ ἐναντιουμένων κωλύεσθαι, διδομένης δὲ εἰρήνης ἀσμένους δέξεσθαί τε καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἀποδώσειν.	Thus spake the Lacedaemonians, thinking that in times past the Athenians had coveted peace and been hindered of it by them, and that being now offered, they would gladly accept of it.
ποίους δέ τινας δεσπότας ἡγῇ τοὺς τὰ μὲν ἄριστα κωλύοντας, τὰ δὲ κάκιστα ἀναγκάζοντας; ὡς δυνατὸν νὴ Δί’, ἔφη, κακίστους. δουλείαν δὲ ποίαν κακίστην νομίζεις εἶναι; ἐγὼ μέν, ἔφη, τὴν παρὰ τοῖς κακίστοις δεσπόταις.	What sort of masters are they, in your opinion, who prevent the best and enforce the worst?The worst possible, of course.And what sort of slavery do you believe to be the worst?Slavery to the worst masters, I think.The worst slavery, therefore, is the slavery endured by the incontinent?I think so.
ὄλωλεν ἡ δύστηνος, ὡς κλύω, γυνή·	[Exit Messenger. She is dead, poor lady, so I hear.
πεποιῆσθαι δέ φασι τὰς αὐλὰς τοσαύτας, ὅτι τοὺς νομοὺς ἔθος ἦν ἐκεῖσε συνέρχεσθαι πάντας ἀριστίνδην μετὰ τῶν οἰκείων ἱερέων καὶ ἱερειῶν, θυσίας τε καὶ δικαιοδοσίας περὶ τῶν μεγίστων χάριν·	They built, it is said, this number of aul, because it was the custom for all the nomes to assemble there together according to their rank, with their own priests and priestesses, for the purpose of performing sacrifices and making offerings to the gods, and of administering justice in matters of great importance.
σὺ δὲ μὴ νομίσῃς ἀθῷος ἔσεσθαι θεομαχεῖν ἐπιχειρήσας.	But you, do not suppose yourself to be innocent, for you have attempted to fight against God!”
στρατηγοὶ δὲ Φωκέων Κριτόβουλός τε ἦν καὶ Ἀντίοχος.	The generals of the Phocians were Critobulus and Antiochus.
ἔτυχε γὰρ αὐτοῖς ὁ Καύνιος Πρωτογένης γράφων τὴν περὶ τὸν Ἰάλυσον διάθεσιν, καὶ τὸν πίνακα μικρὸν ἀπολείποντα τοῦ τέλος ἔχειν ἔν τινι τῶν προαστείων ἔλαβεν ὁ Δημήτριος.	It happened, namely, that Protogenes the Caunian had been making a painting for them which illustrated the story of Ialysus, and this picture, nearly finished, had been captured by Demetrius in one of the suburbs of the city.
Ἀρτεμίδωρος δὲ ἀντειπὼν τούτῳ καὶ ἅμα παρ’ αὑτοῦ τινα θεὶς αἰτίαν, μνησθεὶς δὲ καὶ τῆς Σιλανοῦ δόξης τοῦ συγγραφέως, οὔ μοι δοκεῖ μνήμης ἄξια εἰπεῖν, ὡς ἂν ἰδιώτης περὶ ταῦτα καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ Σιλανός.	Artemidorus rejects this explanation, and substitutes one of his own, recording at the same time the opinion of the historian Silanus but neither one or other of their views seems to me worth relating, since both he and Silanus were ignorant in regard to these matters.
καὶ γνώσονται πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ταπεινῶν ξύλον ὑψηλὸν καὶ ὑψῶν ξύλον ταπεινόν, καὶ ξηραίνων ξύλον χλωρὸν καὶ ἀναθάλλων ξύλον ξηρόν. ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα καὶ ποιήσω.	And all the trees of the field will know that I am the Lord, who brings a lofty tree down and raises a humble tree up and who dries up green wood and makes dry wood sprout. I, the Lord, have spoken and I will do it.” ’ ”
ἔχοντος δὲ Ἀριστοδήμου τά τε ἄλλα ἀθύμως καὶ τὸν ὄνειρον ἡγουμένου προλέγειν οἱ τοῦ βίου τελευτήν, ὅτι οἱ Μεσσήνιοι τῶν ἐπιφανῶν τὰς ἐκφορὰς ἐποιοῦντο ἐστεφανωμένων καὶ ἱμάτια ἐπιβεβλημένων λευκά, ἀπαγγέλλει τις Ὀφιονέα τὸν μάντιν οὐχ ὁρᾶν ἔτι ἀλλ’ ἐξαίφνης γενέσθαι τυφλόν, ὥσπερ γε καὶ ἦν τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς.	Aristodemus, who was already in despair, thought the dream foretold the end of life for him, because the Messenians used to carry out their chiefs for burial wearing a crown and dressed in white garments. Then he received news that Ophioneus the seer could no longer see but had suddenly become blind, as he was at first.

ἢν δὲ ἀπόπληκτον ὁ Ἱπποκράτης εἴπῃ σκέλος τὸ κατ’ ἴξιν, ὡς νεκρῶδες, τὸ ἀχρεῖον καὶ τὸ ἀναλδὲς θέλει φράσαι.	And when Hippocrates says, "the leg on the same side was apoplectic," he means to say that it was in a death-like, useless, and incurable state
καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ποιμένα καὶ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ γεωργὸν καὶ τὸ γεώργιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἡγεμόνας καὶ στρατηγούς σου.	And I will scatter shepherd and his flock among you, and I will scatter farmer and his field among you, and I will scatter your leaders and commanders among you.
οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἡμεῖς χρημάτων γε ἕνεκα, ἵνα λάβοιμεν, εὖ ὑμᾶς ἐποιοῦμεν, ἀλλ’ ἵνα, εἴ ποτε κίνδυνος εἴη ἡμῖν, ἐξαιτούμενοι παρ’ ὑμῶν τὴν ἀξίαν χάριν ἀπολάβοιμεν.	For indeed it was not for the sake of money that we might get that we sought your good our purpose was that, if we found ourselves in trouble, we might be saved by this plea, and might obtain our due reward at your hands.
ὧν αἰτιατέον μὲν τοὺς φυτεύοντας ἀεὶ τῶν φυτευομένων μᾶλλον καὶ τοὺς τρέφοντας τῶν τρεφομένων, προθυμητέον μήν, ὅπῃ τις δύναται, καὶ διὰ τροφῆς καὶ δι’ ἐπιτηδευμάτων μαθημάτων τε φυγεῖν μὲν κακίαν, τοὐναντίον δὲ ἑλεῖν.	And for these we must always blame the begetters more than the begotten, and the nurses more than the nurslings yet each man must endeavor, as best he can, by means of nurture and by his pursuits and studies to flee the evil and to pursue the good.
Πάντα δὲ ὅσα ἄνθρωπος ἐσθίει ἢ πίνει, τὰ τοιαῦτα βρώματα ἥκιστα τουτέου χυμοῦ ἀκρήτου τε καὶ διαφέροντος δῆλα ἔσται μετέχοντα, οἷον ἄρτος τε καὶ μᾶζα καὶ τὰ ἑπόμενα τουτέοισιν οἷσιν εἴθισται ὥνθρωπος πλείστοισί τε καὶ αἰεὶ χρέεσθαι, ἔξω τῶν πρὸς ἡδονήν τε καὶ κόρον ἠρτυμένων τε καὶ ἐσκευασμένων·	But all those things which a man eats and drinks are devoid of any such intense and well-marked quality, such as bread, cake, and many other things of a similar nature which man is accustomed to use for food, with the exception of condiments and confectioneries, which are made to gratify the palate and for luxury.
οὐκ ἀλλ’ ὅτε περ ὁ δεσπότης ἔποψ ἐγένετο, τότε γενέσθαι μ’ ηὔξατο ὄρνιν, ἵν’ ἀκόλουθον διάκονόν τ’ ἔχῃ.	No, but when my master was turned into a hoopoe, he begged me to become a bird also, to follow and to serve him.
καθ᾽ ὅσον δ᾽ ἂν ἀποστῶσι τῆς τούτων ἀκριβοῦς ἐπιμελείας,ἄπορα μὲν γίνεται τὰ πόριμα, τρέπεται δὲ εἰς συμφορὰς ἀνηκέστους ὅ τι ποτ᾽ ἂνὡς ἀγαθὸν δρᾶν σπουδάσωσιν,	but when people turn aside in any way from their strict observance, what before was possible becomes impossible and any project they set about turns into an absolute disaster.
ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ὑπελίπετο οὗτος καὶ ἄλλο τοιόνδε ἐς μνήμην.	But there is also another memorial of himself left by this emperor.
βοῦς ἤλθομεν νίψοντες ἐναλίᾳ δρόσῳ.	We came to wash our cattle in the salt water.
εἰ μὲν οὖν ἐκείνοις ἐθέλεις χρῆσθαι, κατάλιπε ἔφασαν ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ διακινδύνευε ἐκεῖσε ἄγων, ἵνα λύσωνταί μοι τὸ χωρίον, ἀποδόντες Ἀρχένεῳ καὶ Θρασυλόχῳ τὰς τριάκοντα μνᾶς.	So, if you want to make use of that, they said, leave money here, and do not run the risk of carrying it abroad. For they wanted to redeem the farm for me by paying Archeneüs and Thrasylochus thirty minae.
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν εἴη δίκαιον, χθὲς ὑπὸ σοῦ ξενισθέντας οἷς ἦν πρέπον ξενίοις, μὴ οὐ προθύμως σὲ τοὺς λοιποὺς ἡμῶν ἀνταφεστιᾶν.	for indeed it would not be at all right, after the splendid hospitality we received from you yesterday, if we—that is, those who are left of us—failed to entertain you cordially in return.
ἐν τούτῳ τῷ ᾄσματι ἄλλαι τε ἐς τὸν Ἅιδην εἰσὶν ἐπικλήσεις καὶ ὁ χρυσήνιος, δῆλα ὡς ἐπὶ τῆς Κόρης τῇ ἁρπαγῇ.	In this song, among the epithets he applies to Hades is “golden-reined”—a clear reference to the rape of Persephone.
Τότε ἤρξατο καταθεματίζειν καὶ ὀμνύειν ὅτι Οὐκ οἶδα τὸν ἄνθρωπον. Καὶ εὐθέως ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησεν.	Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the Man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
εὐλογημένος εἶ ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ὑπερυμνητὸς καὶ ὑπερένδοξος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.	You are blessed in the foundation of heaven and highly praised and highly glorified ⌊forever⌋.

σὺ δὲ ἀγανακτεῖς, ἀγνοῶν ὅπῃ τὸ περὶ σὲ ἄριστον τῷ παντὶ συμβαίνει καὶ σοὶ κατὰ δύναμιν τὴν τῆς κοινῆς γενέσεως.	but thou art vexed, because thou knowest not how what is best in thy case for the All turns out best for thyself also, in accordance with the power of your common origin.
ἔστι δ’ ἡ πλείστη τῆς νήσου πεδιὰς καὶ κατάδρυμος, πολλὰ δὲ καὶ γεώλοφα τῶν χωρίων ἐστί, φέρει δὲ σῖτον καὶ βοσκήματα καὶ χρυσὸν καὶ ἄργυρον καὶ σίδηρον· ταῦτά δὴ κομίζεται ἐξ αὐτῆς καὶ δέρματα καὶ ἀνδράποδα καὶ κύνες εὐφυεῖς πρὸς τὰς κυνηγεσίας·	The greatest portion of the island is level and woody, although many tracts are hilly. It produces corn, cattle, gold, silver, and iron, which things are brought thence, and also skins, and slaves, and dogs sagacious in hunting
ἐπιστραφεὶς δὲ Φαραὼ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστησεν τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τούτῳ.	And Pharaoh turned around and entered into his house, and he did not set his mind even yet upon this.
Φησὶ δὲ Ἀντίγονος ὁ Καρύστιος ἐν τοῖς Βίοις τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ πρῶτόν τε εἶναι τῶν πολιτῶν καὶ ἁρματοτροφῆσαι.	Antigonus of Carystus in his Biographies says that his father was foremost among the citizens and kept horses to compete in the chariot-race
αὐτὴ σὺ ταῦτα μανθάνουσ’ ἤδη φράσαι.	That is for you, using your judgment, to consider now for yourself.

ἐν δὲ τῇ Λιβύῃ Καρχηδόνιοι μὲν ἄρχουσι, Λίβυες δὲ ἄρχονται.	In Africa the Carthaginians rule, and the Libyans are ruled.

Διὸ οὐκ ἠξίουν ἔγωγε κενῆς αὐτέην ὑποθέσιος δέεσθαι, ὥσπερ τὰ ἀφανέα τε καὶ ἀπορεόμενα· περὶ ὧν ἀνάγκη, ἤν τις ἐπιχειροίη λέγειν, ὑποθέσει χρέεσθαι·	Wherefore I have deemed that it has no need of an empty postulate, as do insoluble mysteries, about which any exponent must use a postulate, for example, things in the sky or below the earth.
ἔχεις καὶ τούτων ἀνάγραπτον τὴν μαρτυρίαν , ἐκ τῶν κατὰ Ἒδεσσαν τὸ τηνικαῦτα βασιλευομένην πόλιν γραμματοφυλακείων ληφθεῖσαν.	There is also documentary evidence οf these things taken from the archives at Edessa whieh was at that time a capital city.
καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις προσβολαῖς ταῖς κατὰ τὴν πορείαν συχναῖς γενομέναις οὐκ ὀλίγοι ἐτεθνήκεσαν.	In the numerous other encounters upon the march, not a few also had fallen.
οὐ γὰρ ἂν κατὰ τὴν ἐκείνου προφητείαν, εἰ συνέβαινεν αὐτοματισμῷ τινι τὸν κόσμον διάγειν, πάντα ἑωρῶμεν ἀποβαίνοντα.	for if that were the case, that the world went on by mechanical necessity, we should not see that all things would come to pass according to his prophecy.
Διὰ τί, τῶν μὲν εὐθυγράμμων τῶν δὲ κυκλικῶν σωμάτων καὶ σχημάτων ὄντων, τὰς τῶν εὐθυγράμμων ἀρχὰς ἔλαβε τὸ ἰσοσκελὲς τρίγωνον καὶ τὸ σκαληνόν·	WHY, SINCE BODIES AND FIGURES ARE CONTAINED PARTLY BY RECTTLINEARS AND PARTLY BY CIRCLES, DOES HE MAKE ISOSCELES TRIANGLES AND TRIANGLES OF UNEQUAL SIDES THE PRINCIPLES OF RECTILINEARS
αἴτιοι δ’ ὑμεῖς κακῶς ἀγωνοθετοῦντες, οἵτινες εἰώθατε θεαταὶ μὲν τῶν λόγων γίγνεσθαι, ἀκροαταὶ δὲ τῶν ἔργων, τὰ μὲν μέλλοντα ἔργα ἀπὸ τῶν εὖ εἰπόντων σκοποῦντες ὡς δυνατὰ γίγνεσθαι, τὰ δὲ πεπραγμένα ἤδη, οὐ τὸ δρασθὲν πιστότερον ὄψει λαβόντες ἢ τὸ ἀκουσθέν, ἀπὸ τῶν λόγῳ καλῶς ἐπιτιμησάντων·	The persons to blame are you who are so foolish as to institute these contests who go to see an oration as you would to see a sight, take your facts on hearsay, judge of the practicability of a project by the wit of its advocates, and trust for the truth as to past events not to the fact which you saw more than to the clever strictures which you heard
οὕτω δὲ καὶ Ἐπίκουρος.	and so does Epicurus.
οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἔκ γε τῶν ἐντέρων καὶ τῆς κοιλίας τροφὴν οὕτω παχεῖάν τε καὶ βαρεῖαν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἐχόντων δύνανταί τι μεταλαμβάνειν, ὅ τι καὶ ἄξιον λόγου, φθάνουσαι πληροῦσθαι τοῖς κουφοτέροις.	for these arteries cannot get anything worth speaking of from the thick heavy nutriment contained in the intestines and stomach, since they first become filled with lighter elements.
μείζων δ’ ἐστὶν ὁ λέων τοῦ ἀστακοῦ.	And the lion is larger than the astacus
ἀμήχανον γάρ, ἅ τις εἰδέναι οἴεται, ταῦτα ἄρξασθαι μανθάνειν.	For it is impossible for any one to begin to learn what he thinks that he already knows.
τίς ἐν δαψιλαίῳ χώρῳ πηγὴν ὕδατος ἀνορύξας αὖθις κατέχωσεν ταύτην;	who diggeth a spring of water in a thirsty land and straightway filleth it in?
ὁ δὲ Θράσυλος ἐκ τῆς Σάμου, ἐπειδὴ ἐπύθετο αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς Μιλήτου ἀπηρκότα, ἔπλει καὶ αὐτὸς ναυσὶν εὐθὺς πέντε καὶ πεντήκοντα, ἐπειγόμενος μὴ φθάσῃ ἐς τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ἐσπλεύσας.	Thrasyllus having been advertised of his departure from Miletus, he also puts to sea from Samos with five-and-fifty sail, hasting to be in the Hellespont before him.
καὶ μέγα ἀνακραγόντος οἰμωγή τε αὖθις ἀνὰ τὸ βασίλειον ἦν καὶ θόρυβος μέγας ὡς οἰχομένου τοῦ βασιλέως.	Whereupon a woeful lamentation echoed through the palace, and a great tumult was made, as if the king were dead.
καθόλου γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ γένος ἡθροίζετο πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπιμελῶς ἐκ τῆς οἰκουμένης, οἷς ἄβατος ἦν ἡ θρέψασα δι’ ἀσέβειαν καὶ παρανομίαν.	For this was, generally speaking, the class of men which he collected out of all parts of the world, whose own country was closed to them owing to their crimes and felonies.
ἐπεὶ δὲ κατεχρήσαντο μὲν ἀσεβῶς τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους, τροφῇ ταύτῃ χρώμενοι, κατεχρήσαντο δὲ τὰ δουλικὰ τῶν σωμάτων, ἐβοήθει δ’ ἐκ τοῦ Τύνητος οὐδείς, τότε προδήλου τῆς αἰκίας διὰ τὴν περικάκησιν ἐκ τῶν πολλῶν τοῖς ἡγεμόσιν ὑπαρχούσης, ἔκριναν οἱ περὶ τὸν Αὐτάριτον καὶ Ζάρζαν καὶ Σπένδιον ἐγχειρίζειν ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς πολεμίοις καὶ διαλαλεῖν περὶ διαλύσεως Ἀμίλκᾳ.	But when they had used up for food the captives in this horrible manner, and then the bodies of their slaves, and still no one came to their relief from Tunes, their sufferings became too dreadful to bear and the common soldiers broke out into open threats of violence against their officers. Thereupon Autaritus, Zarzas, and Spendius decided to put themselves into the hands of the enemy and to hold a parley with Hamilcar, and try to make terms.
εἶτα διδάξας Πέρσας μετὰ τοῦτ᾽ ἐπιθυμεῖν ἐξεδίδαξα νικᾶν ἀεὶ τοὺς ἀντιπάλους, κοσμήσας ἔργον ἄριστον. ἐχάρην γοῦν, ̣ ἡνίκ᾽ ἤκουσα περὶ Δαρείου τεθνεῶτος, ̣ ὁ χορὸς δ᾽ εὐθὺς τὼ χεῖρ᾽ ὡδὶ συγκρούσας εἶπεν ᾽ ἰαυοῖ.	then, producing the persians after that, i taught them to yearn to beat the enemy; this finest feat did i honor. well, i rejoiced when you lamented for the death of darius, and the chorus straightway clapped their hands like this and said, " ee - ow!"
τὸν δὲ ὑπασπιστὴν αἰσθόμενος εἰληφότα χρήματα πολλὰ παρ’ ἀνδρὸς αἰχμαλώτου γεγονότος, ἐμοὶ μέν, εἶπεν, ἀπόδος τὴν ἀσπίδα, σεαυτῷ δὲ πρίω καπηλεῖον, ἐν ᾧ καταζήσεις·	Learning that his shield-bearer had received a great deal of money from a man who had been taken captive in the war, he said to him, Give me back my shield, and buy yourself a tavern in which to spend the rest of your days
καὶ μὴν ὅτι πολλὰ μὲν ἂν χρήματ’ ἔδωκε Φιλιστίδης ὥστ’ ἔχειν Ὠρεόν, πολλὰ δὲ Κλείταρχος ὥστ’ ἔχειν Ἐρέτριαν, πολλὰ δ’ αὐτὸς ὁ Φίλιππος ὥστε ταῦθ’ ὑπάρχειν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτῷ, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων μηδὲν ἐξελέγχεσθαι μηδ’ ἃ ποιῶν ἠδίκει μηδέν’ ἐξετάζειν πανταχοῦ, οὐδεὶς ἀγνοεῖ, καὶ πάντων ἥκιστα σύ·	Now that Philistides would have paid a large sum for possession of Oreus, and Cleitarchus for possession of Eretria, and Philip himself to get those advantages of position against you, or to escape conviction in other matters or any inquiry into his wrongdoing in every quarter, is well known to all—and to no one better than to you, Aeschines.
λέγεται δὲ μηδὲ γνήσιος φῦναι, λαβεῖν δὲ αὐτὸν ἡ συνοικοῦσα τῷ Φιλίππῳ νεογνὸν ἀκεστρίας τινὸς Ἀργολικῆς Γναθαινίου τοὔνομα τεκούσης, καὶ λαθεῖν ὑποβαλομένη.	And it is said that he was not even a true-born son, but that Philip’s wife took him at his birth from his mother, a certain sempstress, an Argive woman named Gnathaenion, and passed him off as her own.
ᾔτει γὰρ τοσαῦτα ὑπερβάλλων ὁ Ἀλκιβιάδης, λέγων αὐτὸς ὑπὲρ παρόντος τοῦ Τισσαφέρνους, ὥστε τὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων, καίπερ ἐπὶ πολὺ ὅτι αἰτοίη ξυγχωρούντων, ὅμως αἴτιον γενέσθαι·	For Alcibiades being the man that spake for Tissaphernes, though he were also present, made unto them such excessive demands that though the Athenians should have yielded to the greatest part of them, yet it must have been attributed to them that the treaty went not on.
καὶ παρεγένετο Γεδεὼν πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχὼθ καὶ εἶπεν Ἰδοὺ Ζέβεε καὶ Σελμανά, ἐν οἷς ὠνειδίσατέ με λέγοντες Μὴ χεὶρ Ζέβεε καὶ Σελμανὰ νῦν ἐν χειρί σου, ὅτι δώσομεν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς ἐκλιποῦσιν ἄρτους;	And Gideon came to the rulers of Succoth and said, “Behold, Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you reproached me, when you said, ‘Is the hand of Zebah and Selmana now in your hand, that we should give bread to the men who faint?’ ”
κατά τε τὴν ἕξιν τὴν σωματικὴν ἤδη καὶ πρεσβύτης ὑπάρχων οὐδὲν ἧττον ἀθλητοῦ στερεός τε καὶ ἐπικεκαυμένος τὸ εἶδος, πίων τε καὶ τετριμμένος τὸ δὲ μέγεθος σύμμετρος, ὡς δῆλον ἐκ τοῦ εἰκονίου τοῦ ἐν Ἐρετρίᾳ ἐν τῷ ἀρχαίῳ σταδίῳ.	In his habit of body, even in old age, he was as firm and sunburnt in appearance as any athlete, being stout and always in the pink of condition in stature he was wellproportioned, as may be seen from the statuette in the ancient Stadium at Eretria.
πλεῖστον δ’ αὐτοῦ λόγον εἶναι παρὰ τῷ Φιλίππῳ τῶν δημαγωγούντων, ὁμολογεῖν δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἀπεχθανομένους ὅτι πρὸς ἔνδοξον αὐτοῖς ἄνθρωπον ὁ ἀγών ἐστι.	Philip, too, made more account of him than of any other popular leader at Athens, and it was admitted even by those who hated him that they had to contend with a man of mark.
Αἰγινῆται δὲ οἰκοῦσιν ἔχοντες τὴν νῆσον ἀπαντικρὺ τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας.	The Aeginetans dwell in the island over against Epidauria.
καὶ ἡ ἐνδώμησις τοῦ τείχους αὐτῆς ἴασπις, καὶ ἡ πόλις χρυσίον καθαρὸν ὅμοιον ὑάλῳ καθαρῷ.	The city's wall is made of jasper and the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.
πάλαι μὲν γὰρ δήπου οἷς μεμέληκεν ἀκηκόαμεν ὅτι Νικίας ποτὲ ὁ Νικηράτου ἐκτήσατο ἐν τοῖς ἀργυρείοις χιλίους ἀνθρώπους, οὓς ἐκεῖνος Σωσίᾳ τῷ Θρᾳκὶ ἐξεμίσθωσεν, ἐφ’ ᾧ ὀβολὸν μὲν ἀτελῆ ἑκάστου τῆς ἡμέρας ἀποδιδόναι, τὸν δ’ ἀριθμὸν ἴσους ἀεὶ παρέχειν.	Those of us who have given thought to the matter have heard long ago, I imagine, that Nicias son of Niceratus, once owned a thousand men in the mines, and let them out to Socias the Thracian, on condition that Sosias paid him an obol a day per man net and filled all vacancies as they occurred.
πάμπολλα γὰρ ἐπήγετο, καὶ προὔθηκεν ἐξ αὐτῶν διαρπάσαι τοῖς Κρησὶν ἐκπώματα καὶ κρατῆρας καὶ τὴν ἄλλην ἐν ἀργύρῳ καὶ χρυσῷ κατασκευὴν εἰς πεντήκοντα ταλάντων λόγον.	For he was carrying along vast treasures, and had handed out from them for distribution among the Cretans drinking cups and mixing bowls and other furniture of gold and silver to a value of fifty talents.
διὸ καὶ σφόδρα δεῖ τῶν λοιπῶν ὑμᾶς, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, φροντίσαι, ἵνα ταῦτ’ ἐπανορθωσάμενοι τὴν ἐπὶ τοῖς πεπραγμένοις ἀδοξίαν ἀποτριψώμεθα.	It is therefore our duty, men of Athens, to keep a careful eye on the future, that by restoring our prosperity we may efface the discredit of the past.
τῷ δὲ Λαβὰν ἦσαν δύο θυγατέρες· ὄνομα τῇ μείζονι Λεία, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ νεωτέρᾳ Ῥαχήλ.	⌊Laban had⌋ two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
καὶ συνομιλῶν αὐτῷ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ εὑρίσκει συνεληλυθότας πολλούς,	Peter continued talking with him as he went in, and he found many people gathered together.
φέρειν δ’ ἡ γῆ πλεῖστον τὸ ἄμωμον ἀγαθή·	it was a soil that bare amomum in great plenty
περὶ δὲ τῆς ἀναδόσεως τὸν λόγον ποιούμενος οὐδ’ ἄχρι συλλαβῆς μιᾶς ἐμνημόνευσε τῆς Ἱπποκρατείου δόξης.	But when he is dealing with anadosis he does not mention the Hippocratic view even to the extent of a single syllable.
ἀλλ’ ἡμὶν Αἴας ποῦ ’στιν, ὡς φράσω τάδε;	But where shall I find Ajax, to tell him this?
καὶ ὅτι ἀληθῆ ταῦτα λέγω, τούτων ὑμῖν μάρτυρας τοὺς παρόντας Βρυτιδῶν παρέξομαι. ΜΑΡΤΥΡΕΣ.	To prove that these statements of mine are true, I will bring before you as witnesses the members of the Brytid gens who were present.
πάντων δ’ ἄριστος Κορίνθιος παῖς αἰχμάλωτος, ὅθ’ ἡ πόλις ἀπώλετο καὶ Μόμμιος ἐκ τῶν ἐλευθέρων τοὺς ἐπισταμένους γράμματα παῖδας εὐσυσκοπῶν ἐκέλευσε γράψαι στίχον, ἔγραψε τρὶς μάκαρες Δαναοὶ καὶ τετράκις, οἳ τότ’ ὄλοντο·	But that Corinthian captive boy excelled all, who, when the city was destroyed, and Mummius, taking a survey of all the free-born children that understood letters, commanded each to write a verse, wrote thus Thrice, four times blest, the happy Greeks that fell.
εἰ δὲ τῇ πρεσβυτάτῃ τῶν φυλῶν, εἰκότως ἂν ἡ Ῥουβήλου τὴν τιμὴν ἔχοι λαμβανόντων αὐτὴν Δαθάμου καὶ Ἀβιράμου καὶ Φαλαοῦς·	but if God had determined to bestow it on the eldest be, that of Reuben might have it most justly and then Dathan, and Abiram, and [On, the son of] Peleth, would have it
ἀλλὰ ξενικὴν παίδευσιν οὐ νόμιμον αὐτοῖς παιδεύειν, ἐπεὶ εὖ ἴσθι, εἴπερ τις ἄλλος ἐκεῖθεν χρήματα ἔλαβεν πώποτε ἐπὶ παιδεύσει, καὶ ἐμὲ ἂν λαβεῖν πολὺ μάλιστα χαίρουσι γοῦν ἀκούοντες ἐμοῦ καὶ ἐπαινοῦσιν ἀλλ’, ὃ λέγω, οὐ νόμος.	but it is not lawful for them to give them a foreign education for you may be sure that if anybody had ever received money there in payment for education, I should have received by far the most they certainly enjoy hearing me and they applaud me but, as I say, it is not the law.
κατωρθωμένων δὲ τῶν πρώτων καὶ τῆς πόλεως εὐαγγέλια θυούσης, ἐρωτηθεὶς εἰ ταῦτα ἤθελεν αὑτῷ πεπρᾶχθαι, πεπρᾶχθαι μὲν οὖν, ἔφη, ταῦτα, βεβουλεῦσθαι δὲ ἐκεῖνα.	However, the first attempts were successful, and, when the State was offering sacrifices to celebrate the good tidings, Phocion was asked whether he wished that these deeds had been done by himself. Yes, said he, these deeds done, but that advice given.
καί μοι πάνυ τήρει τὸ τοιόνδε, μή που παιδικόν τι λάθωμεν εἶδος τῶν λόγων ποιούμενοι, καί τις πάλιν ἡμῖν αὐτὸ ὀνειδίσῃ.	And please be especially careful that we do not inadvertently give a playful turn to our argument and somebody reproach us again for it.
Ἰησοῦς δ’ ὁ ἄρχων οὐδὲν ὑποστειλάμενος ἀναφανδὸν εἶπεν·	But Jesus, who was the ruler, made no scruple to speak out, and said openly," O fellow citizens!

ὥσπερ τι δεινὸν ἀγγελῶν ἐπείγεται.	he seems to us the bearer of terrible tidings.
ἐκ τούτου διετέλουν περὶ τε πολέμου καὶ εἰρήνης βουλευόμενοι μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τὰ πρὸς τοὺς συμμάχους ἀμφίβολα δι’ ἐκείνων βραβεύοντες.	As the result of this they continued to consult with the women in regard to war and peace, and to decide through them any disputed matters in their relations with their allies.
ἐκ θεοῦ δ’ ἱερεύς τις ἄ- τας δόμοις προσεθρέφθη.	A priest of ruin, by order of a god, it was reared in the house.
ἀπέλυσεν δὲ τὸν διὰ στάσιν καὶ φόνον βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν ὃν ᾐτοῦντο· τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν παρέδωκεν τῷ θελήματι αὐτῶν.¶	He released the man they asked for, who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.
καὶ γὰρ ἂν ἀβελτερώτατος εἴη πάντων ἀνθρώπων, εἰ τῶν ἀδικουμένων ὑμῶν μηδὲν ἐγκαλούντων αὐτῷ, ἀλλ’ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν τινὰς αἰτιωμένων, ἐκεῖνος ἐκλύσας τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔριν ὑμῶν καὶ φιλονικίαν ἐφ’ αὑτὸν προείποι τρέπεσθαι, καὶ τῶν παρ’ ἑαυτοῦ μισθοφορούντων τοὺς λόγους ἀφέλοιτο, οἷς ἀναβάλλουσιν ὑμᾶς, λέγοντες ὡς ἐκεῖνός γ’ οὐ πολεμεῖ τῇ πόλει.	For indeed he would be the most fatuous man on earth if, when you, his victims, charge him with no crime, but throw the blame on some of your own fellow-citizens, he should compose your mutual differences and jealousies, and invite you to turn them against himself, and should deprive his own hirelings of the excuses with which they put you off, saying that at any rate it is not Philip who is making war on Athens.
ἔτι δὲ πότερον περὶ τὰς οὐσίας μόνον ἡ θεωρία ἐστὶν ἢ καὶ περὶ τὰ συμβεβηκότα ταύταις;	(v.) Further, is this study concerned only with substances, or with their attributes as well?
ἐπεί μ’ ἔρως ἔτρωσεν, ἐσκόπουν ὅπως κάλλιστ’ ἐνέγκαιμ’ αὐτόν.	When love wounded me, I bethought me how I best might bear the smart.

οὗτος μὲν οὖν ἐκτήσατο χωρίον ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας, καὶ πρηνὴς γενόμενος ἐλάκησεν μέσος καὶ ἐξεχύθη πάντα τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ,	(Now this man Judas acquired a field with the reward of his unjust deed, and falling headfirst he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.
ἀκούων οὖν πολλῶν λεγόντων, ὅτι πλοῦς μὲν ὁ παρὰ γῆν περίπατος;	It is a common saying, that a voyage near the land and a walk near the sea are the best recreation.

λαχόντος γὰρ ἐμοῦ τὴν δίκην ταύτην Βοιωτῷ Μαντίου Θορικίῳ, ἐξ ἀρχῆς τ’ ἠντεδίκει καὶ ὑπώμνυθ’ ὡς ὢν Βοιωτός, καὶ τὸ τελευταῖον, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτ’ ἐνῆν αὐτῷ διακρούσασθαι, ἐρήμην ἐάσας καταδιαιτῆσαι, σκέψασθε πρὸς θεῶν τί ἐποίησεν·	For when I had entered this suit against Boeotus, son of Mantias, of Thoricus, at the first he accepted service of the suit, and put in an oath for delay, as being Boeotus but finally, when there was no longer room for evasion, he allowed the arbitrators to give judgement against him by default, and then, in Heaven’s name, see what he did—
καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ἰεροβοάμ Λάβε σεαυτῷ δέκα ῥήγματα, ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ῥήσσω τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς Σαλωμών, καὶ δώσω σοι δέκα σκῆπτρα·	He said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces because this is what the Lord the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes.

Νεάνθης δ’ ὁ Κυζικηνὸς ὁ καὶ περὶ τῶν Πυθαγορικῶν εἰπών φησι Μέτωνος τελευτήσαντος τυραννίδος ἀρχὴν ὑποφύεσθαι· εἶτα τὸν Ἐμπεδοκλέα πεῖσαι τοὺς Ἀκραγαντίνους παύσασθαι μὲν τῶν στάσεων, ἰσότητα δὲ πολιτικὴν ἀσκεῖν.	Neanthes of Cyzicus, who tells about the Pythagoreans, relates that, after the death of Meton, the germs of a tyranny began to show themselves, that then it was Empedocles who persuaded the Agrigentines to put an end to their factions and cultivate equality in politics.
ἕκαστον κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος· ἐπιστράφητε καὶ ἀποστρέψατε ἐκ πασῶν τῶν ἀσεβειῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς κόλασιν ἀδικίας.	I will judge you each according to his way, O house of Israel,” says the Lord. “Turn around, and turn away from all your impious acts, and they will not become a punishment of injustice for you.
Ἀσία καὶ Συρία καὶ Αἴγυπτος καὶ τὰ πολεμοῦντα Ἰουδαίοις στρατεύματα μεθ’ ἡμῶν, ἥ τε σύγκλητος παρ’ ἡμῖν καί τέκνα τῶν ἐναντίων καὶ γυναῖκες, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔστι πρὸς Ἀννίβαν οὐδὲ Πύρρον οὐδὲ Κίμβρους ὁ πόλεμος ὑπὲρ τῆς Ἰταλίας, ἀλλὰ Ῥωμαίοις πολεμοῦντες ἀμφότεροι τὴν πατρίδα καὶ νικῶντες ἀδικοῦμεν καὶ νικώμενοι.	Asia, Syria, Egypt, and the armies fighting against the Jews, are on our side the senate, too, is with us, as well as the wives and children of our adversaries. Still, it is not to defend Italy against Hannibal, or Pyrrhus, or the Cimbri, that our war is waged, but both parties are waging war against Romans, and we sin against our country whether we conquer or are conquered.
γενόμενος δὲ κύριος τῆς τε Βαβυλωνίας καὶ τῆς περὶ τὴν Ἐρυθρὰν θάλατταν ἧκε πρὸς Σοῦσα.	That of Babylon fell next, and then the Satrapy which lay along the Persian Gulf. This brought him to Susa, which he also carried without a blow

τῷ δ’ Ἀντιφίλου λιμένι ἑξῆς ἔστι λιμὴν καλούμενος κολοβῶν ἄλσος καὶ Βερενίκη πόλις ἡ κατὰ Σαβὰς καὶ Σαβαί, πόλις εὐμεγέθης, εἶτα τὸ τοῦ Εὐμένους ἄλσος.	Next to the harbour of Antiphilus is a port called the Grove of the Colobi (or the Mutilated), the city Berenice of Sab, and Sab a considerable city then he grove of Eumenes.
Μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς πολλὰς ἐκείνας ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου· καὶ κατεστέναξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων καὶ ἀνεβόησαν, καὶ ἀνέβη ἡ βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων.	After those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned because of the labor and cried out, and so their cry went up to God because of the labor.
ταῦτα ἀλγηδόνων ἰάματα ἀνθρώποις γίνεται.	These prove to be cures for the pains of men.

εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἐπ’ ἐλευθερίᾳ καταβάλλοιμι αὐτῶν τὸ ἀργύριον, τοῦτο μόνον ἀπώλλυον ὃ δοίην αὐτῷ, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν δεινὸν ἔπασχον·	For if I used the money to buy their freedom I was simply losing whatever I gave him without suffering any serious harm.
ὡς δὲ αὐτὸν μόλις ἡμέρας ὁ Πομπήιος καταλαβὼν εἴχετο τῶν ὑστάτων, ὁ μὲν καὶ τότε τῶν φίλων ἐκτάξαι κελευόντων οὐκ ἐμάχετο, ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἱππεῦσι μόνοις τοὺς πλησιάζοντας ἀνακόπτων ἑσπέρας ἐν ὕλαις ηὐλίσατο πυκναῖς.	Pompey overtook him with difficulty in the daytime and assailed his rear guard. The king's friends then urged him to prepare for battle, but he would not fight.

Διονυσόδωρος δὲ οὔ φησιν ἀδικεῖν δι’ αὐτὸ τοῦτο· οὐ γὰρ δεῖν αὑτὸν ἀποδοῦναι πάντας τοὺς τόκους, ἐπειδὴ ἡ ναῦς οὐ κατέπλευσεν εἰς τὸν Πειραιᾶ.	Dionysodorus, however, claims that he is doing no wrong because of this very fact, since he is not bound to pay the interest in its entirety inasmuch as the ship did not complete her voyage to Peiraeus.
νῦν οὖν χρὴ νομίζειν τιμωρουμένους καὶ ἀπαλλαττομένους Ἀνδοκίδου τὴν πόλιν καθαίρειν καὶ ἀποδιοπομπεῖσθαι καὶ φαρμακὸν ἀποπέμπειν καὶ ἀλιτηρίου ἀπαλλάττεσθαι, ὡς ἓν τούτων οὗτός ἐστι.	You should therefore, consider that to-day, in punishing Andocides and in ridding yourselves of him, you are cleansing the city, you are solemnly purifying it from pollution, you are dispatching a foul scapegoat, you are getting rid of a reprobate for this man is all of them in one.
καίτοι μ’ οὐ λέληθεν ὅτι χαλεπὸν μέν ἐστιν καὶ τὴν σὴν φύσιν ἀξίως τῶν ὑπαρχόντων διελθεῖν, ἔτι δ’ ἐπικινδυνότερον τὸ συμβουλεύειν μέλλονθ’ αὑτὸν ὑπεύθυνον τῷ πεισθέντι καταστῆσαι.	And yet it does not escape me that it is difficult to describe your character in keeping with your deserts and that it is more hazardous still to give advice when the adviser is bound to make himself answerable for his advice to the one who accepts it.
αὐτὸς δὲ λήξαντος τοῦ πνεύματος εἰς Μιτυλήνην κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Βυζάντιον παρακομισθείς, ὡς ἤκουσεν ἐντὸς Κυανέων ἤδη πεπλευκέναι τὸν Ἀγρίππαν, μετέσπευδεν ὡς ἐνῆν.	And when the high winds were laid, he sailed to Mytilene, and thence to Byzantium and when he heard that Agrippa was sailed beyond the Cyanean rocks, he made all the haste possible to overtake him, and came up with him about Sinope, in Pontus.
ἐξὸν γὰρ αὐτῷ χιλίαις ναυσὶ διαβιβάσαι κατὰ τὸ στενότατον τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου τὴν πεζὴν στρατιὰν ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας εἰς τὴν Εὐρώπην, οὐκ ἠθέλησεν, ἡγούμενος τὴν διατριβὴν αὑτῷ	although he had a thousand ships to spare for transporting his land army over the most narrow part of the Hellespont, he decided against it, for he judged that it would cause him a great waste of time
ἐλθόντες δὲ καὶ ἀνακαλύψαντες τὴν κλίνην καὶ τὸ σόφισμα τῆς γυναικὸς εὑρόντες ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ.	Now when they came and uncovered the bed, and found out the woman's contrivance, they told it to the king
καὶ μὴν τό γε τῶν ἰκτερικῶν βοήθημα πολλάκις ἱστοροῦμεν·	Besides everybody knows the remedy for the jaundice
οὓς καὶ πολίτας ὕστερον ποιήσαντες προσηγόρευσαν ἐπευνάκτους, ὅτι κατετάχθησαν ἀντὶ τῶν τετελευτηκότων εἰς τὰς στιβάδας.	and afterwards they made those men citizens, and called them Epeunacti, because they had been put into the beds of those who were dead instead of them.
σὺ εἶ ὁ καταξιώσας δέξασθαι δωρεὰν ἵνα γένῃ ἡμῖν ἄφεσις ἁμαρτιῶν καὶ οἱ ἐσθίοντές σε ἀθάνατοι γένωνται·	thou art he that vouchsafest to receive a gift, that thou mayest become unto us remission of sins, and that they who eat thee may become immortal
ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτὸν λέγουσι πορευόμενον εἰς Θήβαςἐπὶ τὸν Λαΐου ἀγῶνα πρὸς τῶν ἀγωνιστῶν ἐνεδρευθέντα διὰ φθόνον ἀπολέσθαι.	But some say that as he journeyed to Thebes to take part in the games in honor of Laius, he was waylaid and murdered by the jealous competitors.
ᾨδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν. Ἐκ βαθέων ἐκέκραξά σε, Κύριε·	A song of ascent.
ἔγωγε τῷδε τοῦ Ῥαδαμάνθυος μᾶλλον πέποιθα καὶ δικαιότερον λέγω.	for my part I put more faith in him than Rhadamanthus, declaring him more just.
τὸ δὲ ἀπὸ τούτου ἀγὼν μὲν ὁ ἐπὶ Πελίᾳ πέπαυται, τὴν ὕδραν δέ, τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ τῇ Ἀμυμώνῃ θηρίον, Ἡρακλεῖ τοξεύοντι Ἀθηνᾶ παρέστηκεν·	At this point the funeral games of Pelias come to an end, and Heracles, with Athena standing beside him, is shooting at the hydra, the beast in the river Amymone.
τελευτῶν δὲ καὶ τὴν Καρίαν αὐτὴν διαρρεῖ τὴν ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰώνων νῦν κατεχομένην, καὶ μεταξὺ Μιλήτου καὶ Πριήνης ποιεῖται τὰς ἐκβολάς.	Towards its termination it runs through the part of Caria occupied by the Ionians the mouths by which it empties itself are between Miletus and Priene.
λέγω δὲ οἷον εἴ τις φαίη δυνατὸν τὴν διάμετρον μετρηθῆναι οὐ μέντοι μετρηθήσεσθαι ὁ μὴ λογιζόμενος τὸ ἀδύνατον εἶναι ὅτι οὐθὲν κωλύει δυνατόν τι ὂν εἶναι ἢ γενέσθαι μὴ εἶναι μηδ’ ἔσεσθαι.	the sort of man who does not take the impossible into accountwere to say that it is possible to measure the diagonal of a square, but that it will not be measured, because there is nothing to prevent a thing which is capable of being or coming to be from neither being nor being likely ever to be.
τό τε μέγιστον, ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ἀγνοεῖσθαι παρ’ αὐτοῖς πρότερον τὰ κατὰ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους ὥστε σχεδὸν μηδ’ ἑωρακότας τοὺς ἀνταγωνιστὰς παρατάττεσθαι καὶ συγκαταβαίνειν εἰς τοὺς ὁλοσχερεῖς κινδύνους.	and what was most important of all, they had been so entirely ignorant of their opponents, that they had been brought into the field, and engaged in a pitched battle with an enemy that they had never once set eyes on.
καὶ γὰρ τὸ διαπιστεῖν τῇ τύχῃ, καὶ μάλιστα κατὰ τὰς εὐπραγίας, ἐναργέστατον ἐφάνη πᾶσιν τότε διὰ τῶν Μάρκου συμπτωμάτων·	Above all, the disaster of Regulus gives the clearest possible warning that no one should feel too confident of the favours of Fortune, especially in the hour of success.
καὶ Μαριάμμην δ’ ἐξέδωκεν Ἀρχελάῳ τῷ Ἑλκίου παιδὶ πρότερον ὑπὸ Ἀγρίππα τοῦ πατρὸς ἁρμοσθεῖσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ γίνεται θυγάτηρ αὐτοῖς ὄνομα Βερενίκη.	He also gave Mariamne in marriage to Archelaus, the son of Helcias, to whom she had formerly been betrothed by Agrippa her father from which marriage was derived a daughter, whose name was Bernice.
διατρίβει δὲ οὐδὲ ὁ Ἑλεάζαρος ἐν τῇ ἱερωσύνῃ ἐπικατασταθέντος αὐτῷ ζῶντι Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Σεὲ παιδός.	Nor did this Eleazar retain the high priesthood for long, being replaced during his lifetime by Joshua, son of See.
ἁπλῶς μὲν οὖν διωρίσθω τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον, ἀκριβέστερον δ᾽, ὅταν περὶ τῶν ἕξεων λέγωμεν τῶν ἀντικειμένων.	let us then accept these simple definitions, and let us make them more precise when we are speaking about the opposite dispositions.
δηλοῖ δὲ τὰ τετράμετρα· ἔστι γὰρ τροχερὸς ῥυθμὸς τὰ τετράμετρα.	this is clear from the tetrameters, which form a tripping rhythm.
οὕτω γὰρ ἂν ἦν ὁ Γηρυόνης ζηλωτὸς ἔχων σκέλη πολλὰ καὶ χεῖρας καὶ ὀφθαλμούς, εἰ πάντα μιᾷ ψυχῇ διῴκει.	For thus Geryon would have become admirable, having many legs, hands, and eyes, if only they had been all governed by one soul.
τῶν δ’ ἑφθῶν ποδῶν μνημονεύει Φερεκράτης ἐν Δουλοδιδασκάλῳ ·	And Pherecrates also speaks of boiled feet, in his Slave-master— A.
οἱ δ’ ἄρχοντες τῶν Συρακουσίων καταγέλαστοι γεγονότες ὑπὸ τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ τὴν αἰσχύνην ἀναλαβεῖν ζητοῦντες,	But the leaders of the Syracusans, now that they were become a laughing-stock for the women, sought to redeem their disgrace, armed the citizens again, and pursued after Dion.
ἐνστάσης δὲ τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τὸν δῆμον αὐτοῦ καλοῦντος ἐπὶ τὴν ψῆφον, ἡρπάσθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν πλουσίων αἱ ὑδρίαι, καὶ τὰ γινόμενα πολλὴν εἶχε σύγχυσιν.	When the appointed day was come and Tiberius was summoning the people to the vote, the voting urns were stolen away by the party of the rich, and great confusion arose.
ἔτ’ Ἀσωποῦ με δέξεται γάνος χαλκέοις ἐν ὅπλοις Δαναϊδῶν στρατηλάταν, τοῦ φθιμένου πατρὸς ἐκδικαστάν.	Shall Asopus’ laughing tide ever reflect my brazen arms as I lead on my Argive troops? To avenge thy fallen sire.
περὶ δὲ τῆς ὑλικῆς οὐσίας δεῖ μὴ λανθάνειν ὅτι εἰ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ πάντα πρώτου ἢ τῶν αὐτῶν ὡς πρώτων καὶ ἡ αὐτὴ ὕλη ὡς ἀρχὴ τοῖς γιγνομένοις, ὅμως ἔστι τις οἰκεία ἑκάστου, οἷον φλέγματος [ἐστι πρώτη ὕλη] τὰ γλυκέα ἢ λιπαρά, χολῆς δὲ τὰ πικρὰ ἢ ἄλλ᾽ ἄττα· ἴσως δὲ ταῦτα ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ. γίγνονται δὲ πλείους ὗλαι τοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅταν θατέρου ἡ ἑτέρα ᾖ, οἷον φλέγμα ἐκ λιπαροῦ καὶ γλυκέος εἰ τὸ λιπαρὸν ἐκ τοῦ γλυκέος, ἐκ δὲ χολῆς τῷ ἀναλύεσθαι εἰς τὴν πρώτην ὕλην τὴν χολήν. διχῶς γὰρ	and since the definition is a formula, and the formula has parts, we have been compelled to investigate " parts," and to discover what things are parts of the substance, and what are not; and whether the parts of the substance are also parts of the definition. further, then, neither the universal nor the genus is substance. as for the ideas and the objects of mathematics ( for some say that these exist apart from sensible substances ) we must consider them later. but now let us proceed to discuss
ταῦτ’ ἐρρήθη, καὶ οὐκέτι μετεπέμψατό με εἰς τὴν οἴκησιν πάλιν, ὡς ἤδη σαφῶς Θεοδότου μὲν ὄντος μου καὶ Ἡρακλείδου φίλου, αὐτοῦ δ’ ἐχθροῦ, καὶ οὐκ εὐνοεῖν ᾤετό με, ὅτι Δίωνι τὰ χρήματα ἔρρει παντελῶς.	and after this he did not summon me again to his house, as though it was now quite clear that I was friendly towards Theodotes and Heracleides but hostile to him and he supposed that I bore him no goodwill because of the clean sweep he was making of Dion’s moneys.
ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἐπειδὴ εἰς ταύτην τὴν τάξιν ὑπὸ τοῦ δαιμονίου, ὥς φησιν αὐτός, κατετάχθη, μηκέτι ἐξέλιπεν.	but being, as he himself declares, divinely appointed to such a post, he never deserted it.
τότε δὲ φεύγουσα ἐς θάλασσαν αὑτὴν καὶ τὸν παῖδα ἀπὸ τῆς πέτρας τῆς Μολουρίδος ἀφίησιν, ἐξενεχθέντος δὲ ἐς τὸν Κορινθίων ἰσθμὸν ὑπὸ δελφῖνος ὡς λέγεται τοῦ παιδός, τιμαὶ καὶ ἄλλαι τῷ Μελικέρτῃ δίδονται μετονομασθέντι Παλαίμονι καὶ τῶν Ἰσθμίων ἐπ’ αὐτῷ τὸν ἀγῶνα ἄγουσι.	Then it was that she fled to the sea and cast herself and her son from the Molurian Rock. The son, they say, was landed on the Corinthian Isthmus by a dolphin, and honors were offered to Melicertes, then renamed Palaemon, including the celebration of the Isthmian games.
καὶ ὁ Μυρτίλος ἡδέως πως συναπογραφόμενος αὐτῷ, ἵνα μηδενὸς μεταλαμβάνῃ, ἀλλὰ πάντα λαλῇ, ἔφη·	But Myrtilus in a pleasant manner declared that he subscribed to Ulpian's sentiments, so as to be willing to have nothing to eat, as long as he might talk and said
καὶ ἐπιθυμῶν χορτασθῆναι ἀπὸ τῶν ψιχίων τῶν πιπτόντων ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ πλουσίου· ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ κύνες ἐρχόμενοι ἀπέλειχον τὰ ἕλκη αὐτοῦ.	"desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
Συμβούλιον δὲ λαβόντες ἠγόρασαν ἐξ αὐτῶν τὸν ἀγρὸν τοῦ κεραμέως, εἰς ταφὴν τοῖς ξένοις.	And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτῆς πόα καὶ σχοῖνοι πεφύκασι.	Upon its banks grow grass and rushes.
Γεδεὼν δὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀποθέσθαι βουλόμενος βιασθεὶς ἔσχεν αὐτὴν ἐπ’ ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα βραβεύων αὐτοῖς τὰ δίκαια καὶ περὶ τῶν διαφορῶν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν βαδιζόντων κύρια πάντα ἦν τὰ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ λεγόμενα.	Hereupon Gideon would have laid down the government, but was over-persuaded to take it, which he enjoyed forty years, and distributed justice to them, as the people came to him in their differences and what he determined was esteemed valid by all.
καὶ φέγγος αὐτοῦ ὡς φῶς ἔσται· κέρατα ἐν χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθετο ἀγάπησιν κραταιὰν ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ.	And his splendor will be like a light; horns are in his hands. And he has established a strong love of his strength.
οὐδ’ αὖ τὸ δεινὸν προσπόλου φευξούμεθα·	Besides, I will not run away from a servant’s fears
φαίνεται δ’ ἀεὶ ἄλλου ἡ ἐπιστήμη καὶ ἡ αἴσθησις καὶ ἡ δόξα καὶ ἡ διάνοια, αὑτῆς δ’ ἐν παρέργῳ.	Yet it seems that knowledge and perception and opinion and understanding are always of something else, and only incidentally of themselves.
ἀνδράποδόν εἰμι δειλὸν ἐν θαλάσσῃ, πρὸς τοὺς πόνους ἀπαγορεύω, μαίνομαι κακῶς ἀκούσας ὑπ’ ὀργῆς ἀλλὰ τούτῳ φησὶν οὐδέν ἐστι δεινόν, οὐδὲν πονηρόν, ἀλλ’ ἴδιος ἄνθρωπος, πάντα πράως φέρει, πάντ’ ἀλύπως.	I am a miserable coward on the water, I have no stomach for hardships, I go mad with anger when anyone speaks ill of me but for this man here, he says, nothing has any terrors, nothing any hardship, but he is a singular person he bears everything with good humour, everything without distress.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἀποστάντων τοῦ παραγγέλλειν ὑπατείαν, Λεύκιον Δομέτιον Κάτων ἔπεισε καὶ παρεθάρρυνε μὴ ἀπειπεῖν οὐ γὰρ ὑπὲρ ἀρχῆς, ἀλλ’ ὑπὲρ ἐλευθερίας εἶναι τὸν ἀγῶνα πρὸς τοὺς τυράννους, οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Πομπήϊον φοβηθέντες τὸν τόνον τοῦ Κάτωνος, μὴ τὴν βουλὴν ἔχων ἅπασαν ἀποσπάσῃ καὶ μεταβάλῃ τοῦ δήμου τὸ ὑγιαῖνον, οὐκ εἴασαν εἰς ἀγορὰν κατεχθεῖν τὸν Δομέτιον,	However, though all the rest declined to be candidates for the consulship, Cato encouraged and persuaded Lucius Domitius not to desist, for the struggle with the tyrants, he said, was not for office, but for liberty. But Pompey and his partisans, seeing the firmness of Cato, and fearing lest, having all the senate with him, he should draw away and pervert the sound-minded among the people, would not suffer Domitius to go down into the forum,
καὶ ἡ ὑπόστασις ἀπεκαλύφθη καὶ αὕτη ἀνέβαινεν καὶ αἱ δοῦλαι αὐτῆς ἤγοντο καθὼς περιστεραὶ φθεγγόμεναι ἐν καρδίαις αὐτῶν.	And the foundation was uncovered, and this was going up, and its servants were being led, uttering sounds like doves in their hearts.
πάντα δ᾽, ὅσα παρέλαβον, φυλάσσειν ἔκρινα τῷ βασιλεῖ.	and I resolved to keep for the king whatever I received.
ἐπεὶ καὶ τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ζῴου, μέχρι μὲν ἔμπνουν ἐστὶ καὶ θαλερόν, ὡς οἱ ποιηταὶ λέγουσι, θερμότητι χρῆται καὶ ζωῇ·	Since the body of a living creature, while it breathes and flourishes (as the poets say), enjoys both heat and life
Χειροῦται μὲν οὕτως τὰ σπήλαια καὶ τοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς Ἡρώδης·	By this means Herod subdued these caves, and the robbers that were in them.
“πάντων μὲν εἶπεν ἀνθρώπους περικρατεῖν, οἳ καὶ τὴν γῆν καταναγκάζουσιν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν εἶναι χρησίμην αὐτοῖς πρὸς ἃ θέλουσιν, τούτων δ’ ἄρχουσιν οἱ βασιλεῖς καὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν ἔχουσιν·	and said," They are men who govern all things they force the earth and the sea to become profitable to them in what they desire, and over these men do kings rule, and over them they have authority.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἰερεμίας πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ λέγων Κύριος ἀπέστειλέν με προφητεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην πάντας τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἠκούσατε.	And Jeremiah said to the rulers and to all the people, saying, “The Lord sent me to prophesy all the words that you have heard against this house and against this city.
ὅταν ταῦτα λέγῃ δήπου, ὁμολογεῖ μὲν εἶναι βελτίω καὶ δικαιότερον τόνδε τὸν νόμον οὗ τέθεικεν αὐτός, ὑπὲρ δὲ τοῦ πῶς τεθήσεται ποιεῖται τὸν λόγον.	Leptines, in saying this, obviously admits that our law is better and fairer than his own, but bases his argument on the way in which it is to be passed.
οἷον οὖν ὑπερσκελὲς ἢ καί τινα ἑτέραν ὑπέρεξιν ἄμετρον ἑαυτῷ τι σῶμα ὂν ἅμα μὲν αἰσχρόν, ἅμα δ’ ἐν τῇ κοινωνίᾳ τῶν πόνων πολλοὺς μὲν κόπους, πολλὰ δὲ σπάσματα καὶ διὰ τὴν παραφορότητα πτώματα παρέχον μυρίων κακῶν αἴτιον ἑαυτῷ,	A body, for example, which is too long in the legs, or otherwise disproportioned owing to some excess, is not only ugly, but, when joint effort is required, it is also the source of much fatigue and many sprains and falls by reason of its clumsy motion, whereby it causes itself countless evils.
“ ἐν τῆ πρώτῃ μου,’’ φηαίν, “ ἀπολογίᾳ οὐδείς μοι παρεγένετο , ἀλλὰ πάντες με ἐγκατέλιπον μὴ αὐτοῖς λογισθείη, ὁ δὲ κύριός μοι παρέατη καὶ ἐνεδυνάμωσέν με, ἵνα δι’ ἐμοῦ τὸ κήρυγμα πληροφορηθῇ καὶ ἀκούσωσι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἐρρύαθην ἐκ στόματος λέοντος.	“ Αt my first defence," he says, “ no man was with me, but all deserted me (may it not be laid to their charge), but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me that the preaching might be fuh filled by me and all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered from the lion's mouth."
γεννᾶσθαί τε αὐτὸν ἐκ πυρὸς καὶ πάλιν ἐκπυροῦσθαι κατά τινας περιόδους ἐναλλὰξ τὸν σύμπαντα αἰῶνα· τοῦτο δὲ γίνεσθαι καθ’ εἱμαρμένην.	And it is alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny.
διωκόμενος δὲ διέπεσε διὰ τῆς ἀγορᾶς καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἔφθασεν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τῆς χαλκιοίκου Ἀθηνᾶς καταφυγών Ἄλκανδρος δὲ ἐπιστραφέντος αὐτοῦ διώκων τῇ βακτηρίᾳ τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν ἐξέκοψεν αὐτοῦ.	As he was being pursued, he rushed through the market-place and he out-distanced almost all his pursuers, and gained refuge in the shrine of Athena of the Brazen House only, as he turned around, Alcander, who was pursuing him, put out one of his eyes by a stroke of his staff.
ἐκ τούτου Κικέρων, εἰς μοναρχίαν τῆς πολιτείας μεθεστώσης, ἀφέμενος τοῦ τὰ κοινὰ πράττειν ἐσχόλαζε τοῖς βουλομένοις φιλοσοφεῖν τῶν νέων, καὶ σχεδὸν ἐκ τῆς πρὸς τούτους συνηθείας, εὐγενεστάτους καὶ πρώτους ὄντας, αὖθις ἴσχυεν ἐν τῇ πόλει μέγιστον.	After this, when the government had been changed to a monarchy, Cicero abstained from public affairs and devoted his time to those of the young men who wished to study philosophy, and mainly from his intimacy with these, since they were of the highest birth and standing, he was once more very influential in the state.
καίτοι οὔτι λέγω ὡς οὐ πολλά με ταράττει. συνωμολογήκαμεν ἄρα, ἦ δ’ ὅς, ἁπλῶς τοῦτο, μηδέποτε ἐναντίον ἑαυτῷ τὸ ἐναντίον ἔσεσθαι. παντάπασιν, ἔφη. ἔτι δή μοι καὶ τόδε σκέψαι, ἔφη, εἰ ἄρα συνομολογήσεις.	though I confess that objections often do trouble me.Well, we are quite agreed, said Socrates, upon this, that an opposite can never be its own opposite.Entirely agreed, said Cebes.Now, said he, see if you agree with me in what follows
ὡς μὲν οὖν ἐλυπήθην καὶ συνεταράχθην ἀκούσας ἀποδέξασθαί τινας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, οὐκ ἂν δυναίμην εἰπεῖν·	Now I could not possibly convey to you how troubled and disturbed I was on hearing that some accepted these statements as true.
ὁ μὲν δὴ Πόπλιος ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἐς Ἐλαίαν νοσηλευόμενος ὑπεχώρει, σύμβουλον τῷ ἀδελφῷ Γναῖον Δομίτιον καταλιπών·	After this conference Publius was taken sick and withdrew to Elæa, leaving Gnæus Domitius as his brother's counsellor.
ὡς γὰρ τάχιστ᾽ ἀφικόμεθα πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἄγοντες ἄνδρα τότε μὲν ἀθλιώτατον νῦν δ᾽ εἴ τιν᾽ ἄλλον μακάριον κεὐδαίμονα, πρῶτον μὲν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ θάλατταν ἤγομεν, ἔπειτ᾽ ἐλοῦμεν. νὴ Δί᾽ εὐδαίμων ἄρ᾽ ἦν ἀνὴρ γέρων ψυχρᾷ θαλάττῃ λούμενος.	having arrived near to the temple with our patient, then so unfortunate, but now at the apex of happiness, of blessedness, we first led him down to the sea to purify him. ah! what a singular pleasure for an old man to bathe in the cold sea - water!
καὶ σύ, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἰδοὺ δέδονται ἐπὶ σὲ δεσμοί, καὶ δήσουσίν σε ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃς ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν.	And you, son of man, look! Bonds have been placed upon you and they will bind you with them and you shall certainly not go out from their midst.
Ἐφράιμ, καὶ ἐπὶ πύλην τὴν ἰχθυηρὰν καὶ πύργῳ Ἁνανεὴλ καὶ ἕως πύλης τῆς προβατικῆς.	Of Ephraim and to the fish gate and to the tower of Hananel and as far as the sheep gate.
τἀναντία σφίσιν αὐτοῖς ἐψηφίσαντο. οὐκ οὖν αἰσχρόν, εἰ ἃ μὲν Λακεδαιμονίοις συνέθεσθε βεβαιώσετε, ἃ δὲ αὑτοῖς ἐψηφίσασθε οὕτω ῥᾳδίως διαλύσετε, καὶ τὰς μὲν πρὸς ἐκείνους συνθήκας κυρίας ποιήσετε, τὰς δὲ πρὸς αὑτοὺς ἀκύρους;	Would it not then be disgraceful of you, after confirming your agreements with the Lacedaemonians, to shatter so lightly what you have voted on your own account, and to make valid your covenants with them, but invalidate those that you have made with yourselves?
ὁ δὲ τῇ πρὸς ἐκεῖνον ὀργῇ παραπεσὼν οἰκεῖος ἢ φίλος ἢ συνήθης χαλεπωτέροις αὐτοῖς ἐχρήσατο.	and any kinsman or friend or comrade of his who fell foul of their wrath against him, found them exceedingly severe.
ἀλλὰ μὴν σύ γε, ὦ Πολύβιε, ὁ τὰς λαοδογματικὰς ἀποφάσεις περὶ τῶν διαστημάτων εἰσάγων οὐκ ἐν τοῖς ἔξω τῆς Ἑλλάδος μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς Ἑλληνικοῖς, καὶ διδοῖς εὐθύνας τὰς μὲν Ποσειδωνίῳ τὰς δ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρῳ τὰς δ’ ἄλλοις πλείοσι.	But you, Polybius, who introduce popular hearsay, and rumours on the subject of distances, not only of places beyond Greece, but in Greece itself, have you not been called to answer the charges sometimes of Posidonius, sometimes of Artemidorus, and of many other writers?
εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς, ἐν τίνι οὗτος σέσῳσται·	"If we this day are judged for a good deed done to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well,
Σὺ μὲν γὰρ καλῶς εὐχαριστεῖς, ἀλλ' ὁ ἕτερος οὐκ οἰκοδομεῖται.	For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
ὁπότε δ’ αὐτῶν πάρεστι δεόμενος Ῥωμαίων, ἄριστον εἶναι νομίζει τὸ διδόναι τὴν ἐπιτροπὴν ἐκείνοις καὶ περὶ αὑτοῦ καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν·	but seeing that I am here to prefer my request to the Romans themselves, I think it better to leave the interests of myself and my brothers unreservedly in their hands."
Περὶ τῆς Ἀρχυτείου φιλοσοφίας α′ β′ γ′.	On the Philosophy of Archytas, three books.
και τὰ χερουβεὶν εἱστήκει ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ οἴκου ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἔπλησεν τὴν αὐλήν τὴν ἐσωτέραν.	And the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, as the man entered, and the cloud filled the interior court.
καὶ ἥξει, καὶ ἔσται πᾶς τόπος τοῦ ὄρους Σειὼν καὶ πάντα τὰ περικύκλῳ αὐτῆς σκιάσει νεφέλη ἡμέρας, καὶ ὡς καπνοῦ καὶ φωτὸς πυρὸς καιομένου νυκτός, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δόξῃ σκεπασθήσεται·	And it will come, and as for every place of the mountain Zion and all the places surrounding her, a cloud will shade them by day, and like smoke and burning fire light by night, and it will be covered with all the glory.
καὶ αἰσχυνεῖ σε ἐν τοῖς βρώμασιν αὐτοῦ, ἕως οὗ ἀποκενώσῃ σε δὶς ἢ τρίς, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτῳ καταμωκήσεταί σου· μετὰ ταῦτα ὄψεταί σε καὶ καταλείψει σε, καὶ τὴν κεφαλήν αὐτοῦ κινήσει ἐπὶ σοί.	And he will shame you with his foods until he drains you two or three times, and at last he will mock you. After these things, he will see you and leave you behind and shake his head at you.
γίνεται δὲ πρὸς ἀπώλειαν αὐτῶν ἄντικρυς θύελλα δαιμόνιος, ἣ τὰ μὲν Ῥωμαίων ἔφερεν εἰς αὐτοὺς βέλη, τὰ δὲ αὐτῶν ἀνέστρεφεν καὶ πλάγια παρέσυρεν.	However, there arose such a Divine storm against them as was instrumental to their destruction this carried the Roman darts upon them, and made those which they threw return back, and drove them obliquely away from them
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεύς Ὃ ἐὰν ἀρέσῃ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν ποιήσω· καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνὰ χεῖρα τῆς πύλης, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐξεπορεύετο εἰς ἑκατοντάδας καὶ εἰς χιλιάδας.	And the king said to them, “Whatever is best, if it will be pleasing in your eyes, do it.” And the king stood by the entrance of the gate and all the people went out in hundreds and in thousands.
εὐθὺς δὲ Σεύθῃ εἶπεν, ὅτι συστρατεύσοιντο αὐτῷ.	So he told Seuthes at once that they would take service with him.
ἔοικε τοίνυν ἐκ λόγου ὀνόματι συγκεκροτημένῳ, λέγοντος ὅτι τοῦτ’ ἔστιν ὄν, οὗ τυγχάνει ζήτημα ὄν, ὄνομα.	The word ὄνομα seems to be a word composed from a sentence signifying this is a being about which our search is.
μετὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην τροπαῖον ἔστησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις·	After the battle the Athenians erected a trophy and gave truce to the Potidaeans for the taking up of the bodies of their dead.

πεσὼν οὖν ὁ Ἀμνὼν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην νοσεῖν προσεποιήσατο κατὰ τὰς Ἰωνάθου ὑποθήκας.	So Amnon lay down on his bed, and pretended to be sick, as Jonadab had suggested.
κατανοεῖς οὖν ὅτι πρότερον ηὑρέθη ψευδὴς δόξα καὶ λόγος ἢ κατὰ τὴν προσδοκίαν ἣν ἐφοβήθημεν ἄρτι, μὴ παντάπασιν ἀνήνυτον ἔργον ἐπιβαλλοίμεθα ζητοῦντες αὐτό;	Do you see, then, that false opinion and false discourse were found sooner than we expected when we feared a few moments ago that in looking for them we were undertaking an endless task?

τελευτήσας δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα κηδεύεται μὲν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, καταλείπει δὲ τῆς βασιλείας τὸν υἱὸν Φακέαν διάδοχον, ὃς τῇ τοῦ πατρὸς κατακολουθήσας ὠμότητι δυσὶν ἔτεσι μόνοις ἦρξεν. ἔπειτα δολοφονηθεὶς ἐν συμποσίῳ μετὰ φίλων ἀπέθανε Φακέου τινός, ὃς ἦν χιλίαρχος, ἐπιβουλεύσαντος αὐτῷ, παιδὸς δὲ Ῥομελία.	after which he died, and was buried in Samaria, and left his son Pekahiah his successor in the kingdom, who followed the barbarity of his father, and so ruled but two years only, after which he was slain with his friends at a feast, by the treachery of one Pekah, the general of his horse, and the son of Remaliah, who laid snares for him.
ἡ δὲ Κακία παρεστῶσα γυμνὴ καὶ μηδενὸς δεομένη τῶν ἔξωθεν ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐρωτάτω καὶ τὴν Τύχην, πῶς ποιήσει κακοδαίμονα καὶ ἄθυμον τὸν ἄνθρωπον.	and let Vice, standing naked and wanting no exterior things against man, ask Fortune how she will make a man unhappy and faint-hearted.
ἵνα δ’ εἰδῆτε παρ’ οἵους νόμους οἷον οὗτος εἰσήνεγκεν, ἀναγνώσεται πρῶτον ὑμῖν τὸν τούτου νόμον, εἶτα τοὺς ἄλλους, οἷς οὗτος ἐναντίος ἐστίν.	but, to show you the character of the laws he has contravened and of the law he has introduced, the clerk will read to you, first his new law, and then the other laws to which it is repugnant.

πλείους γὰρ ἢ τρισχιλίους τῶν ξένων εἶναι Πελοποννησίους προσέχοντας αὐτῷ, κἂν μόνον νεύσῃ, προθύμως μετὰ τῶν ὅπλων παρεσομένους.	for more than three thousand of the mercenaries were Peloponnesians and attached to himself, and if he but gave them a nod they would readily come to his side in arms.
καίτοι πολλά γε συγκεχωρήκαμεν οὐ συμβαίνονθ’ ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ λόγῳ.	And yet we have conceded many points which were not deducible from our argument.
ὁ δὲ ποιήσας τὸ εἰς Κρατῖνον ἐπίγραμμά φησιν οἶνός τοι χαρίεντι πέλει μέγας ἵππος ἀοιδῷ, ὕδωρ δὲ πίνων χρηστὸν οὐδὲν ἂν τέκοις, ταῦτ’ ἔλεγεν, Διόνυσε, καὶ ἔπνεεν οὐχ ἑνὸς ἀσκοῦ Κρατῖνος, ἀλλὰ παντὸς ὠδώδει πίθου.	And the author of the Epigram on Cratinus says— If with water you fill up your glasses, You'll never write anything wise But wine is the horse of Parnassus, That carries a bard to the skies. And this was Cratinus's thought, Who was ne'er with one bottle content, But stuck to his cups as he ought, And to Bacchus his heart and voice lent.

οὐ γὰρ εἰκὸς τοὺς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ πόλιν τε ὀχυρὰν ἔχοντας καὶ τὸν ναὸν πέμπειν χρήματα εἰς Κῶ, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ τοὺς ἐν Ἀλεξανδρείᾳ κατοικοῦντας Ἰουδαίους πιθανὸν τοῦτ’ ἐστὶ ποιῆσαι μηδὲν Μιθριδάτην δεδιότας.	for it is not probable that those of Judea, who had a strong city and temple, should send their money to Cos nor is it likely that the Jews who are inhabitants of Alexandria should do so neither, since they were ill no fear of Mithridates.
ἡ δὲ φωνὴ προσφερομένη καὶ προστυγχάνουσα σώμασι πολλοῖς καὶ ἀθρόοις ἢ τυφλοῦται παντάπασιν, ἢ διασπάσματα λαμβάνει μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰς ἀντικρούσεις καὶ διατριβάς·	Now the voice, meeting and striking against a great many bodies in its way, is either altogether lost or scattered, and very much and very frequently hindered in its passage

μαθὼν οὖν ἐκ τούτων, ὦ καλέ μου Συραττικέ, τὴν τοῦ μύστρου χρῆσιν ἐμφοροῦ τοῦ χόνδρου, ἵνα μὴ λέγῃς ’ ἄκικύς εἰμι κὠλιγοδρανέω τεθαύμακα δὲ καὶ πῶς οὐκ ἐζήτησας ’ ὁ δὲ χόνδρος πόθεν;	So learning from them, my fine Syrian-Atticist, the use of the spoon, pray eat your groats, that you may not say— But I am languid, weak for want of food. And I have been surprised at your not asking where The word χόνδρος, groats, comes from.
χρόνῳ δ’ ὕστερον, Φιλίππου μὲν τετελευτηκότος Ἀλεξάνδρου δὲ διαβαίνοντος εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν, ἐγράψατο Κτησιφῶντα παρανόμων ἐπὶ ταῖς Δημοσθένους τιμαῖς·	At a later time, when Philip was dead and Alexander was crossing over to Asia, he brought a suit against Ctesiphon for illegal conduct in proposing the honours for Demosthenes
ὑπέρκειται δὲ τῆς τῶν Χαλκιδέων πόλεως τὸ Λήλαντον καλούμενον πεδίον. ἐν δὲ τούτῳ θερμῶν τε ὑδάτων εἰσὶν ἐκβολαὶ πρὸς θεραπείαν νόσων εὐφυεῖς, οἷς ἐχρήσατο καὶ Σύλλας Κορνήλιος ὁ τῶν Ῥωμαίων ἡγεμών·	Above the city of the Chalcidians is the plain called Lelantum, in which are hot springs, adapted to the cure of diseases, and which were used by Cornelius Sylla, the Roman general.

Ἐπίκουρος Νεοκλέους καὶ Χαιρεστράτης, Ἀθηναῖος, τῶν δήμων Γαργήττιος, γένους τοῦ τῶν Φιλαϊδῶν, ὥς φησι Μητρόδωρος ἐν τῷ Περὶ εὐγενείας.

And do so, going naked and barefoot.”

φόνου δ’ ἀγόμενος ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς ἀπελύθη τῶν ἐγκλημάτων ὡς Δημάρατος ἐν δευτέρῳ Ἀρκαδικῶν.	He was prosecuted for murder by his mother, but was acquitted of the charge. So Demaratus in the second book of his Arcadian History.
οὐκοῦν ὁπότε μηδ’ ὑφ’ ἑνὸς ἀπόλλυται κακοῦ, μήτε οἰκείου μήτε ἀλλοτρίου, δῆλον ὅτι ἀνάγκη αὐτὸ ἀεὶ ὂν εἶναι· εἰ δ’ ἀεὶ ὄν, ἀθάνατον.	Then since it is not destroyed by any evil whatever, either its own or alien, it is evident that it must necessarily exist always, and that if it always exists it is immortal.

χωρὶς δὲ τούτων, εἰ μὲν ἐχθρὸς ὢν κακῶς ἐποίει, φίλος δὲ φήσας μετεβέβλητο, τάχ’ ἂν ταῦτά τις ἤκουεν· ἐπειδὴ δ’ οὐ τοιοῦτ’ ἐστίν, ἀλλ’ ἐξ οὗ φίλος εἶναι προσποιεῖται, ἐκ τούτου πλεῖσθ’ ὑμᾶς ἐξηπάτηκεν, εἰ μὴ καὶ δι’ ἐκεῖνα μισεῖν, διά γε ταῦτ’ ἀπιστεῖν δήπου προσήκει.	Apart from that, if he had injured you as an enemy, but had been reformed after claiming to be your friend, such an excuse might, perhaps, have been acceptable but, inasmuch as that is not so, and as most of his deceptions fall after the date of his profession of friendship, you ought to distrust him for his later, if not to dislike him for his earlier, conduct.

ἐξαίφνης δὲ ἰδόντος μου τὴν ἐσθῆτα ὡς ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ ὁμοιωθεῖσαν, καὶ ὅλον ἐμαυτὸν ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ἐθεασάμην, καὶ ἔγνων καὶ εἶδον δι’ αὐτῆς ἐμαυτόν, ὅτι κατὰ μέρος διῃρήμεθα ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ὄντες, καὶ πάλιν ἕν ἐσμεν διὰ μορφῆς μιᾶς.	77 And I beheld upon it all myself (or saw it wholly in myself), and I knew and saw myself through it, 78 that we were divided asunder, being of one and again were one in one shape.

κατὰ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους τούτου τοῦ θέρους καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐς τὸ Ἄργος ἐσέβαλον αὐτοί τε καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι καὶ τῆς γῆς τὴν πολλὴν ἐδῄωσαν, καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι Ἀργείοις τριάκοντα ναυσὶν ἐβοήθησαν·	About the same time of this summer, the Lacedaemonians invaded the territory of Argos, they and their confederates, and wasted a great part of their land. And the Athenians aided the Argives with thirty galleys
Πάλιν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν δύο συμφωνήσωσιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς περὶ παντὸς πράγματος οὗ ἐὰν αἰτήσωνται, γενήσεται αὐτοῖς παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς.	Again, I tell you the truth, if two of you on earth agree about whatever you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
εὐθὺς ἠρέθιζον τοὺς Βρεττανοὺς παρορκῆσαι, ἔγκλημα ἔχοντας ὅτι σπονδῶν σφίσι γενομένων ἔτι παρῆν τὸ στρατόπεδον.	Straightway they stirred up the Britons to violate the oath, complaining that while a treaty with them was in force the camp was still among them.

For they did not consider that the dry or the moist or the hot or the cold or anything else of the kind injures a man, or that he has need of any such thing, but they considered that it is the strength of each thing, that which, being too powerful for the human constitution, it cannot assimilate, which causes harm, and this they sought to take away.
εἰ δὲ καὶ ταῦτα πράττει καὶ τοὺς ποταμούς, ὅταν ὦσι μεγάλοι, ποσὶν οὐ διέρχεται, καὶ τοὺς ὄφεις φεύγει καὶ τοὺς λύκους, μηδὲν εἶναι τούτων οἷον φαίνεται πεπεισμένος ἀμεταπείστως, ἀλλὰ πράττων ἕκαστα κατὰ τὸ φαινόμενον·	But if he not only does these things, but also passes not over rivers, when they are great and high, on foot, and flies from wolves and serpents, not being irrevocably persuaded that any of these things is such as it appears, but yet doing every thing according to what appears to him

Ἀζαρία ἀδελφέ, λάβε μετὰ σεαυτοῦ παῖδα καὶ δύο καμήλους, καὶ πορεύθητι ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδείας παρὰ Γαβαήλ, καὶ κόμισαί μοι τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ αὐτὸν ἄγε μοι εἰς τὸν γάμον.	“Brother Azariah, take with you a servant and two camels and go to Gabael in Rages of Media.

ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνοι μὲν ὁρμητηρίοις ἐχρήσαντο τοῖς τόποις πρὸς τὰ λῃστήρια, αὐτοὶ πειρατεύοντες ἢ τοῖς πειραταῖς λαφυροπώλια καὶ ναύσταθμα παρέχοντες·	But the former used the places of shelter for vessels for piratical purposes themselves, or afforded to pirates a market for their plunder and stations for their vessels.
καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς ἑτέραν κώμην.	and they went on to another village.
εἰ δ’ ἰατρόν, ὡσαύτως, εἰ δ’ ἀρχιτέκτονα.	and sc if he had bought a physician or an architect.
καὶ νῦν τυχεῖν με τῶν πρὶν εἰσόδων μακρῷ ἄριστα δοῖεν·	And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances.
καὶ κατὰ αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν τοῦ πυρὸς ἔκπτωσιν ἀνειλουμένου, καθὰ καὶ βροντὴν ἐνδέχεται γίνεσθαι, πλείονος γενομένου πυρὸς καὶ πνευματωθέντος ἰσχυρότερον καὶ ῥήξαντος τὸ νέφος διὰ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι ὑποχωρεῖν εἰς τὰ ἑξῆς, τῷ πίλησιν γίνεσθαι τὸ μὲν πολὺ πρὸς ὄρος τι ὑψηλόν, ἐν ᾧ μάλιστα κεραυνοὶ πίπτουσιν, ἀεὶ πρὸς ἄλληλα.	or again it may be due like thunder merely to the expulsion of the imprisoned fire, when this has accumulated and been more violently inflated with wind and has torn the cloud, being unable to withdraw to the adjacent parts because it is continually more and more closely compressed—[generally by some high mountain where thunderbolts mostly fall].
ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὴ τοῦ πράγματος λογίσασθε, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, παρ’ ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς, ὁπόθεν ἔμελλεν οὗτος ἀποδώσειν τὸ χρυσίον.	Now, in the light of the facts themselves, consider in your own minds, men of the jury, what means the man was likely to have for discharging the debt.
ὦ κλεινὸν οἴκοις Ἀντιγόνη θάλος πατρί, ἐπεί σε μήτηρ παρθενῶνας ἐκλιπεῖν μεθῆκε μελάθρων ἐς διῆρες ἔσχατον στράτευμ’ ἰδεῖν Ἀργεῖον ἱκεσίαισι σαῖς, ἐπίσχες, ὡς ἂν προυξερευνήσω στίβον, μή τις πολιτῶν ἐν τρίβῳ φαντάζεται, κἀμοὶ μὲν ἔλθῃ φαῦλος ὡς δούλῳ ψόγος, σοὶ δ’ ὡς ἀνάσσῃ·	Exit Jocasta. From the roof.Antigone, famous child in your father’s house, although your mother allowed you at your entreaty to leave your maiden chamber for the topmost story of the house, to see the Argive army, wait, so that I may first investigate the path, whether there be any of the citizens visible on the road, and reproach, a slight matter to a slave like me, should come to you, my royal mistress
κατ’ ἀρχὰς μὲν οὖν τὸ Ἄργος ἐπεκράτει μᾶλλον, εἶθ’ αἱ Μυκῆναι μείζονα ἐπίδοσιν λαβοῦσαι διὰ τὴν τῶν Πελοπιδῶν εἰς αὐτὰς μεθίδρυσιν·	At first Argos was the most powerful of the two cities. Afterwards Mycen received a great increase of inhabitants in consequence of the migration thither of the Pelopid.

τοῦ δὲ Ἀδωνία παρασκευασαμένου δεῖπνον ἔξω τῆς πόλεως παρὰ τὴν πηγὴν τὴν ἐν τῷ βασιλικῷ παραδείσῳ καὶ πάντας καλέσαντος τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς χωρὶς Σολόμωνος, παραλαβόντος δὲ καὶ τὸν στρατηγὸν Ἰώαβον καὶ Ἀβιάθαρον καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς Ἰούδα φυλῆς, οὔτε δὲ Σάδωκον τὸν ἀρχιερέα καὶ Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην καὶ τὸν ἐπὶ τῶν σωματοφυλάκων Βαναίαν καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἐναντίας αἱρέσεως καλέσαντος ἐπὶ τὴν ἑστίασιν,	Adonijah held a supper outside the city, near the fountain in the royal garden, inviting all his brothers except Solomon and he brought along general Joab, and Abiathar and the officers of the tribe of Judas, but he had not invited to this feast either Sadok the high priest, or Nathan the prophet, or Benaiah the chief of the bodyguards, nor any of the opposing party.
οὐδαμῶς, ἔφη. λέγεις, ἔφη, ἁρμόττειν οὐ τοὺς ἀκριβεῖς, ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὴ λυποῦντας ἐν τῇ χρείᾳ. αὐτός, ἔφη, τοῦτο λέγεις, ὦ Σώκρατες, καὶ πάνυ ὀρθῶς ἀποδέχῃ.	They can’t.You mean that the good fits are not the tight ones, but those that don’t chafe the wearer?That is your own meaning, Socrates, and you have hit the right nail on the head.
ὡς δὲ ἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ ἦν, κατέστησε λαβὼν ἐν τάξει μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ τούς τε πεζοὺς καὶ τῶν ἱππέων ὅσους ἐδόκει καλῶς αὐτῷ ἔχειν·	And as soon as Cyrus was in the enemy’s country, he arranged in regular order under his own command the infantry and as much of the cavalry as seemed to him best.
πειδὴ γὰρ εἱστιώμεθ᾽, ὥσπερ ἴστε, πρῶτον μὲν αὐτὸν τὴν λύραν λαβόντ᾽ ἐγὼ ᾽ κέλευσα ᾆσαι Σιμωνίδου μέλος, τὸν Κριὸν ὡς ἐπέχθη.	after we had feasted, as you know, i first bade him take a lyre, and sing a song of simonides, the shearing of the ram.
ταύτας μὲν ἐκ Μαινάλου·	these were cities of Maenalus.
καίτοι ταῦτα, εἰ μὲν ἀκοῦσαι μὲν ἔδει φενακισθῆναι δὲ τὴν πόλιν, ὀρθῶς ἐλέγετο, εἰ δὲ πραχθῆναι τῷ ὄντι, σιωπᾶσθαι συνέφερεν.	Yet if Philip’s promises were merely for show, and if the city was to be deluded, it was right to mention them if, on the other hand, they were really to be fulfilled, it was best to say nothing about them.
εἰ δὴ ταῦτα καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα συνεχῶς τις σκοποῖ καὶ ἀναλαμβάνοι, παύσαιτ’ ἂν ἴσως ἡδόμενος τῷ φλυαρεῖν.	If anyone will but review and recollect constantly these and similar instances, he may conceivably stop taking pleasure in foolish chatter.
καὶ συμβαλὼν Δημοσθένει καὶ περὶ τῆς διαφορᾶς ἀπολογησάμενος, ἀπαλλαγεὶς ἐκεῖθεν, ὑπ’ Ἀρχίου τοῦ Φυγαδοθήρου ἐπικληθέντος, Θουρίου μὲν τὸ γένος ὑποκριτοῦ δὲ τὰ πρῶτα τότε, δὲ τῷ Ἀντιπάτρῳ βοηθοῦντος, ἐλήφθη πρὸς βίαν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος ἐχόμενος τοῦ ἀγάλματος καὶ ἀχθεὶς πρὸς Ἀντίπατρον εἰς Κόρινθον, ἔπειτα βασανιζόμενος, διέφαγε τὴν γλῶτταν, ὥστε μηδὲν ἐξειπεῖν τῶν τῆς πόλεως ἀπορρήτων δυνηθῆναι·	Here he met Demosthenes and excused himself for his disagreement with him. After leaving Aegina he was seized forcibly by Archias, nicknamed The Exile-Hunter (a Thurian by birth, at first an actor, but at that time an assistant of Antipater), in the temple of Poseidon while clinging to the statue of the god. He was brought to Antipater at Corinth, and when put to the torture he bit off his tongue that he might not be able to utter any secrets of his native city.

πολλῶν ὄντων ἀσεβῶν πολλαὶ γίνονται ἁμαρτίαι, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι ἐκείνων πιπτόντων κατάφοβοι γίνονται.	When many are ungodly, many sins take place, but the righteous become fearful of the downfall of those people.
οὐ γὰρ κακῶς ἔοικεν εἰπεῖν ὁ εἰπὼν ὅτι πρῶτος κατέλυσε τὸν δῆμον ὁ πρῶτος ἑστιάσας καὶ δεκάσας.	For it has been well said that he first breaks down the power of the people who first feasts and bribes them.

ὧν δικαίως ἂν ἅπαντες πολλὴν ἀνανδρίαν καὶ μικροψυχίαν καταγνοῖεν, ὅτι προσποιούμενοι φιλοσοφεῖν αὐτοὶ μὲν ἐπὶ μικροῖς φιλοτιμοῦνται, τοῖς δὲ δυναμένοις περὶ τῶν μεγίστων συμβουλεύειν φθονοῦντες διατελοῦσιν.	Justly, however, would all men condemn these persons as guilty of great cowardice and meanness of spirit, for while they make pretence to serious intellectual interests, they pride themselves on petty things and consistently show malice and envy against those who have the ability to give counsel concerning matters of the greatest importance.
καὶ τὸν λαόν μου διδάξουσιν ἀνὰ μέσον ἁγίου καὶ βεβήλου, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον καθαροῦ καὶ ἀκαθάρτου γνωριοῦσιν αὐτοῖς·	And they shall teach my people between holy and impure and explain to them between unclean and clean.
δέομαι οὖν ἐγώ σου μηδενὶ τρόπῳ ἀνεῖναι, ἵνα τῷ ὄντι κατάδηλον γένηται πῶς βιωτέον.	So I beg you not to give up on any account, that it may be made really evident how one ought to live.
οἵους περ τοὺς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀρχομένους οἴεσθε δεῖν περὶ ὑμᾶς εἶναι, τοιούτους χρὴ καὶ περὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τὴν ἐμὴν ὑμᾶς γίγνεσθαι.	just as you think those who are ruled by you should conduct themselves toward you, so you also should conduct yourselves toward my rule.

ὅπερ εἰκότως ἂν εἴη τεκμήριον τοῦ κάλλιστα τὸν νόμον τεθῆναι·	which procedure of ours is a just and sure sign that our law is admirably constituted
οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἐρεῖ γ’ ὡς τοὺς τοιούτους οὐ καὶ προσήκει καὶ οἱ νόμοι κελεύουσιν ταῖς μεγίσταις τιμωρίαις ἐνόχους εἶναι, οὐδ’ ὡς οὗτοι, ὑπὲρ ὧν εὕρηκε τὸν νόμον, οὐ καὶ κλέπται καὶ ἱερόσυλοί εἰσιν, τὰ μὲν ἱερά, τὰς δεκάτας τῆς θεοῦ καὶ τὰς πεντηκοστὰς τῶν ἄλλων θεῶν, σεσυληκότες καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτοὶ ἔχοντες, τὰ δ’ ὅσια, ἃ ἐγίγνετο ὑμέτερα, κεκλοφότες.	—Certainly he cannot deny that such people ought to be, and that the laws make them, liable to the heaviest punishments. Neither can he deny that the men for whose protection he has invented his law are thieves and temple-robbers for the have robbed the temples of the ten per cent due to Athena and of the two per cent due to the other gods they keep the money in their own pockets instead of making restitution, and they have stolen the public share, which belonged to you.

Ἀριστοκράτης δὲ ὁ Ἱππάρχου φησὶ τοὺς ξένους τοῦ Λυκούργου τελευτήσαντος ἐν Κρήτῃ καῦσαι τὸ σῶμα καὶ διασπεῖραι τὴν τέφραν εἰς τὴν θάλατταν, αὐτοῦ δεηθέντος καὶ φυλαξαμένου μή ποτε ἄρα τῶν λειψάνων εἰς Λακεδαίμονα κομισθέντων, ὡς ἐπανήκοντος αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ὅρκων λελυμένων, μεταβάλωσι τὴν πολιτείαν.	Aristocrates the son of Hipparchus says that the friends of Lycurgus, after his death in Crete, burned his body and scattered the ashes into the sea, and that this was done at his request, and because he wished to prevent his remains from ever being carried to Sparta, lest the people there should change his polity, on the plea that he had come back, and that they were therefore released from their oaths.
ὥστε τοῦτ’ ἂν εἴη λεκτέον, ὅτι οὓς λέγομεν εὐτυχεῖς, οὐ διὰ τύχην εἰσίν.	Hence we should have to say that the people we call fortunate are so not by reason of fortune

ἐπὶ τούτοις δὲ πολλῶν νουθετούντων αὐτὸν ὡς ἀποθανούμενον ὑπὸ τοῦ τυράννου, καὶ πυνθανομένων τίνι πιστεύων οὕτως ἀπονοεῖται, τῷ γήρᾳ, εἶπεν.	In view of this, many warned him that the tyrant would put him to death, and asked him on what he relied that he was so lost to all sense, to which he answered, My old age.
διὸ προορώμενος ἕκαστα τούτων ἐχρήσατο παρ’ αὐτὸν τὸν καιρὸν τοιῷδέ τινι γένει στρατηγήματος.	and therefore, with a view to these difficulties, he adopted on the spur of the moment the following strategem.

“Εἶτα πιστὴν γυναῖκα, Κΐνταν καλουμένην, ἐπ’ τὸ εἰδωλεῖον ἀγαγόντες, ἠνάγκαζον προσκυνεῖν ἀποστρεΦομένην δὲ καὶ βδελυττομένην ἐκδήσαντε τῶν ποδῶν διὰ πάσης τῆς πόλεως κατὰ τοῦ τρα χέος λιθοστρώτου σύροντες προσαρασσομένην τοῖ μυλιαίοις λίθοις, ἅμα καὶ μαστιγοῦντες, ἐπὶ τό αὐτὸν ἀγαγόντες κατέλευσαν τόπον.	“Then they led a woman called Quinta, a believer, the idol temple, and were for forcing her to worship. But when she turned away and showed her lisgust, they bound her by the feet and dragged her through the whole city over the rough pavement, hat she was bruised by the big stones, beating her ll the while and bringing her to the same place hey stoned her to death.
ἐγίνοντο οὖν ἀφ’ ἑκατέρων λόγοι καὶ τῶν πρώτων παρ’ ἑκατέροις ἀνδρῶν προασσόντων ἐπιδιαλλαγὰς τάχιστα ἡ σύμβασις ἐγένετο, ὁμονοήσαντές τε μέγα τεκμήριον ἑκάτεροι εὐνοίας ἀλλήλοις ἠξίουν παρασχεῖν τὸ πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἔχθος, ἐπιπεσόντες τε αἰφνίδιον αὐτοῖς κτείνουσι μυριάδας ὑπὲρ πέντε ἀνδρῶν, ἀπώλοντό τε πάντες πλὴν εἴ τινες ἐλέῳ φίλων ἢ γειτόνων ἐπιχωρηθὲν αὐτοῖς ἔφυγον.	and when this was done by the principal men of both nations, they soon agreed to a reconciliation and when they were so agreed, they both knew that the great design of such their union would be their common hatred to the Jews. Accordingly, they fell upon them, and slew about fifty thousand of them nay, the Jews were all destroyed, excepting a few who escaped, either by the compassion which their friends or neighbors afforded them, in order to let them fly away.
ταύτης δὲ τῆς διαφορᾶς θατέρῳ μορίῳ ἔστω ἡ ἐνέργεια ἀφωρισμένη θατέρῳ δὲ τὸ δυνατόν.	Let actuality be defined by one member of this antithesis, and the potential by the other.

With their assistance Mithridates began his third and last war against the Romans, in the course of which he lost his entire kingdom, and Sertorius lost his life in Spain. Two generals were sent against Mithridates from Rome the first, Lucullus, the same who had served as prefect of the fleet under Sulla the second, Pompey, by whom the whole of his dominions, and the adjoining territory as far as the river Euphrates, under the pretext and impetus of the Mithridatic war, were brought under Roman sway.
καὶ ἀποστρέψουσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ νώτου αὐτῶν τοῦ σκληροῦ καὶ ἀπὸ πονηρῶν πραγμάτων αὐτῶν, ὅτι μνησθήσονται τῆς ὁδοῦ πατέρων αὐτῶν τῶν ἁμαρτόντων ἔναντι Κυρίου.	And they will turn away from ⌊their stiff pride or rigid stubbornness⌋ and from their wicked deeds because they will remember the journey of their ancestors, who sinned before the Lord.
ἧττον γὰρ ἐπιθυμοῦσι τῶν ἀπόντων ἐθισθέντες ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν παρόντων.	For they less desire absent things, who are accustomed to abstain from those that are present.
καὶ τοσαύτη τὰς πόλεις χαρὰ καὶ σπουδὴ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους περὶ τὴν ἀπάντησιν εἶχεν ὥστε τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπὸ Κικέρωνος ὕστερον ἐνδεέστερον εἶναι τῆς ἀληθείας, ἔφη γὰρ αὑτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων τὴν Ἰταλίαν φέρουσαν εἰς τὴν Ῥώμην εἰσενεγκεῖν.	and so great was the joy of the cities and the eagerness of men to meet him that what was said by Cicero afterwards fell short of the truth. He said, namely, that Italy had taken him on her shoulders and carried him into Rome.
λέγει γὰρ ἡ γραφὴ τῷ Φαραὼ ὅτι εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἐξήγειρά σε ὅπως ἐνδείξωμαι ἐν σοὶ τὴν δύναμίν μου καὶ ὅπως διαγγελῇ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ.

Now Amnon, David's eldest son, fell in love with her, and being not able to obtain his desires, on account of her virginity, and the custody she was under, was so much out of order, nay, his grief so eat up his body, that he grew lean, and his color was changed.
τούτων γενομένων πολὺ δὴ προθυμότερον καὶ πλείους καὶ Καδούσιοι συνεστρατεύοντο καὶ Σάκαι καὶ Ὑρκάνιοι·	Because of this incident the Cadusians, Sacians, and Hyrcanians joined the expedition in greater numbers and with greatly increased zeal.
μὴ τολμῶντος δὲ τοῦ ὁπλοφόρου κτεῖναι τὸν δεσπότην, αὐτὸς τὴν ἰδίαν σπασάμενος καὶ στήσας ἐπὶ τὴν ἀκμὴν ῥίπτει κατ' αὐτῆς ἑαυτόν: ἀδυνατῶν δὲ μήθ' ἵστασθαι μήτ' ἐπερείσας διαβαλεῖν αὑτοῦ τὸν σίδηρον ἐπιστρέφεται, καὶ νεανίσκου τινὸς ἑστῶτος πυθόμενος τίς εἴη καὶ μαθὼν ὡς Ἀμαληκίτης ἐστὶ παρεκάλεσεν ἐπερείσαντα τὴν ῥομφαίαν διὰ τὸ μὴ ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτὸν δύνασθαι παρασχεῖν αὐτῷ τελευτὴν ὁποίαν αὐτὸς βούλεται.	As the armour-bearer did not dare to kill his master, he drew his own sword and pointing it toward himself, fell upon it, but as he could neither pierce himself or even by leaning against it, push the sword through, he turned round and asked a young man standing nearby who he was, and learning that he was an Amalekite, asked him to push the sword through him, as he was unable to do it with his own hands and so give him the kind of death he wanted.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφάτ Οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ κυρίου ἔτι καὶ ἐπιζητήσομεν παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ;	Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet here a prophet of the Lord, and we shall ask from him?”
Συντελεσθέντων οὖν τῶν χωμάτων θᾶττον πλήθει χειρῶν καὶ τῶν πραττομένων ἔθει προσῆγον τὰς μηχανάς.	Now when the banks were finished, which was done on the sudden, both by the multitude of hands, and by their being accustomed to such work, they brought the machines
ὁ δὲ συνήδεσθαι φήσας αὐτῷ περιόντι καὶ μηδὲν ἐν τῇ μάχῃ πεπονθότι τιμὴν καὶ εὔνοιαν, ἣν ἄν τις ἀδελφῷ παράσχοι, κατεπηγγείλατο. λαβόντες δὲ ὅρκους παρ' αὐτοῦ μηδὲν ἀδικήσειν φανέντα προάγουσι πορευθέντες ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου ἐν ᾧ κέκρυπτο καὶ προσάγουσι τῷ Ἀχάβῳ ἐφ' ἅρματος καθεζομένῳ: ὁ δὲ προσεκύνησεν αὐτόν.	He answered that he was glad he was alive and not harmed in the battle, and he promised him the same honour and favour as a man would show to his brother. Receiving his assurances upon oath that when he came to him he would not be harmed, they went and brought him from the cellar where he was hiding and brought him to Achab as he sat in his chariot and he bowed down to him.
τὸ δὲ ναυτικὸν τέχνης ἐστίν, ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλο τι, καὶ οὐκ ἐνδέχεται, ὅταν τύχῃ, ἐκ παρέργου μελετᾶσθαι, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον μηδὲν ἐκείνῳ πάρεργον ἄλλο γίγνεσθαι.	It must be kept in mind that seamanship, just like anything else, is a matter of art, and will not admit of being taken up occasionally as an occupation for times of leisure on the contrary, it is so exacting as to leave leisure for nothing else.
γενομένης δὲ τῆς μάχης ἐν χερσὶ Δημήτριος ἔχων τοὺς πλείστους καὶ κρατίστους τῶν ἱππέων Ἀντιόχῳ τῷ Σελεύκου συνέπεσε, καὶ μέχρι τροπῆς τῶν πολεμίων λαμπρῶς ἀγωνισάμενος ἐν τῇ διώξει σοβαρᾷ καὶ φιλοτίμῳ παρὰ καιρὸν γενομένῃ τὴν νίκην διέφθειρεν.	After the armies had engaged, Demetrius, with the largest and best part of the cavalry, clashed with Antiochus, the son of Seleucus he fought brilliantly and routed his enemy, but by pursuing him too fiercely and eagerly he threw away the victory.
Ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῇ ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεών σου, ὧν Κύριος ὁ θεός σου δίδωσίν σοι, ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνὴ ὃς ποιήσει τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ σου, παρελθεῖν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ,	“But if in one of your cities that the Lord your God has given to you there is found a man or woman who will do evil before the Lord your God, to transgress his covenant,
καὶ σύνοισθά που καὶ αὐτὸς ὅτι οἱ μέγιστον δυνάμενοί τε καὶ σεμνότατοι ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν αἰσχύνονται λόγους τε γράφειν καὶ καταλείπειν συγγράμματα ἑαυτῶν, δόξαν φοβούμενοι τοῦ ἔπειτα χρόνου, μὴ σοφισταὶ καλῶνται.	and you know yourself that the most influential and important men in our cities are ashamed to write speeches and leave writings behind them, through fear of being called sophists by posterity.
φασὶ δ’ αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ δρομάδων καμήλων ὁδὸν ἡμερῶν τριάκοντα ἢ καὶ τετταράκοντα ἑνδεκαταίους διανύσαι καὶ τελευτῆσαι τὴν πρᾶξιν.	It is said that these persons performed in eleven days, upon dromedaries, a journey of 30 or 40 days, and executed their business.
μέγα μὲν οὖν τὸ πάθος ἐς δύναμιν · κτεῖναι γὰρ πάντων μᾶλλον δυνατώτατον·	Wherefore the affection is mighty in power, for it is the most powerful of all in taking life
ἐν χρήσει γὰρ τὰ αἰσθητὰ καὶ πρόχειρα ὄντα πολλὰς ἀναπτύξεις καὶ θέας αὑτῶν ἄλλοτ’ ἄλλως ἀμειβομένων δίδωσιν.	For sensible things, when they are of daily use and familiar to us, afford us many opportunities to display them and to see them in their various mutations
οὓς μὲν γάρ τις ἔπεμψεν οἶδεν, ἀντὶ δὲ φωτῶν τεύχη καὶ σποδὸς εἰς ἑκά - στου δόμους ἀφικνεῖται. ὁ χρυσαμοιβὸς δ᾽ Ἄρης σωμάτων καὶ ταλαντοῦχος ἐν μάχῃ δορὸς πυρωθὲν ἐξ Ἰλίου φίλοισι πέμπει βαρὺ ψῆγμα δυσδάκρυτον ἀν - τήνορος σποδοῦ γεμί - ζων λέβητας εὐθέτους. στένουσι δ᾽ εὖ λέγοντες ἄν - δρα τὸν μὲν ὡς μάχης ἴδρις, τὸν δ᾽ ἐν φοναῖς καλῶς πεσόντ᾽ - ἀλλοτρίας διαὶ γυναι - κός· τάδε σῖγά τις βαΰ - ζει, φθονερὸν δ᾽ ὑπ᾽ ἄλγος ἕρ - πει προδίκοις Ἀτρείδαις. οἱ δ᾽ αὐτοῦ περὶ τεῖχος θήκας Ἰλιάδος γᾶς εὔμορφοι	each knows whom he sent forth. but to the home of each come urns and ashes, not living men. ares barters the bodies of men for gold; he holds his balance in the contest of the spear; and back from ilium to their loved ones he sends a heavy dust passed through his burning, a dust cried over with plenteous tears, in place of men sending well made urns with ashes. so they lament, praising now this one: " how skilled in battle!" now that one: " fallen
Καὶ τὰ μὲν τῆς Ἀντιόχου τοῦ προσαγορευθέντος Ἐπιφανοῦς τελευτῆς οὕτως εἶχεν.	So in this way the things concerning Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, came to an end.
ποιῆσαι ἔλεος μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ μνησθῆναι διαθήκης ἁγίας αὐτοῦ,	To perform the mercy promised to our fathers And to remember His holy covenant,
συνέβη δὲ καὶ τότε, λῃστῶν τινων ῥιψάντων εἰς τὸν Ἐλισσαίου τάφον ὃν ἦσαν ἀνῃρηκότες, τὸν νεκρὸν τῷ σώματι αὐτοῦ προσκολληθέντα ἀναζωπυρῆσαι.	It also happened, that at that time certain robbers cast a man whom they had slain into Elisha's grave, and upon his dead body coming close to Elisha's body, it revived again.
Λίβυες δ’ Αἰγυπτίων καταγελῶσι μυθολογούντων περὶ τοῦ ὄρυγος, ὡς φωνὴν ἀφιέντος ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ ὥρας ἧς ἐπιτέλλει τὸ ἄστρον, ὃ Σῶθιν αὐτοὶ Κύνα δὲ καὶ Σείριον ἡμεῖς καλοῦμεν·	The Libyans deride the Egyptians for the fables which they report of the oryx, which, as they say, makes a great noise upon the same day, at the very hour, when the Dogstar, which they call Sothes, rises.
ἐὰν μή τις μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί, ἐβλήθη ἔξω ὡς τὸ κλῆμα καὶ ἐξηράνθη, καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ καὶ εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν, καὶ καίεται.	If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.
διαβάλλουσι γάρ μου τὸν βίον, οἰόμενοι τὸν λόγον ἄπιστον καταστήσειν.	For they are casting aspersions on my personal history, thinking to undermine your confidence in my speech.
ὁ δὲ Ἀντώνιος, οὐ γὰρ ἠγνόει μέλλουσαν ἔτι τὴν ἔφοδον αὐτῶν, προεξήγαγε τοὺς ἱππεῖς καὶ οὐδὲν οὔτε πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος οὔτε τὴν τόλμαν ὑποδείσας τῶν πολεμίων καρτερῶς τὰς πρώτας ὁρμὰς ἀνεδέξατο καὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος ὠθουμένους ἀνέστειλεν.	But Antonius was ready for their attack and had his cavalry drawn up in advance and fearing neither the enemy's numbers or daring, stoutly withstood their first attacks and beat them off when they rushed up to the very walls.
Κύριε, εἰ ἐκεῖνοι τοιαῦτα εἰργάσαντο, ἵνα παραπικρανθῇ ὁ ἔνδοξος ἄγγελος, τί ἐγὼ ἐποίησα;	Sir, even if they have done such things that the glorious angel is enraged, what have I done?
τῆς δὲ κρήνης οὐ πόρρω ταύτης ἀρχαῖόν ἐστιν ἱερόν, εἰκόνες δὲ ἐφ’ ἡμῶν ἑστᾶσιν ἐν αὐτῷ βασιλέων Ῥωμαίων καὶ ἄγαλμα κεῖται χαλκοῦν Ἀρτέμιδος ἐπίκλησιν Σωτείρας.	Not far from this fountain is an ancient sanctuary, and in our day likenesses stand in it of Roman emperors, and a bronze image is there of Artemis surnamed Saviour.
ἀλλ’, ὡς ἤδη λέλεκται πολλάκις, ἀρχὴ τούτων ἁπάντων ἐστὶ μία τὸ περὶ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ καὶ ξηροῦ καὶ ὑγροῦ διασκέψασθαι, καθάπερ Ἀριστοτέλης ἐποίησεν ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς, ἀποδείξας ἁπάσας τὰς κατὰ τὰ σώματα μεταβολὰς καὶ ἀλλοιώσεις ὑπὸ τούτων γίγνεσθαι.	But, as has been frequently said already, the one starting-point of all this is a thorough-going enquiry into the question of the Warm, Cold, Dry and Moist this Aristotle carried out in the second of his books "On Genesis and Destruction," where he shows that all the transmutations and alterations throughout the body take place as a result of these principles.
Διὸς δέ σοι πτηνὸς κύων, δαφοινὸς αἰετός, λάβρως διαρταμήσει σώματος μέγα ῥάκος, ἄκλητος ἕρπων δαιταλεὺς πανήμερος, κελαινόβρωτον δ’ ἧπαρ ἐκθοινάσεται.	Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill upon your liver until it is black with gnawing.
εὖ γε νὴ τὸν ἡμέτερον θεόν, ὦ Σώκρατες, τὸν Ἄμμωνα, καὶ δικαίως, καὶ πάνυ μὲν οὖν μνημονικῶς ἐπέπληξάς μοι τὸ περὶ τοὺς λογισμοὺς ἁμάρτημα.	By Ammon, our special divinity, that is a good hit, Socrates evidently you haven’t forgotten your mathematics, and you are quite right in, finding fault with my bad arithmetic.
οὐδὲ ὕδωρ διψῶντας ἐπότισας, ἀλλὰ πεινώντων ἐστέρησας ψωμόν·	Nor did you give water to those who thirsted, but you deprived a morsel to those who hungered.
παραγενομένου δὲ ὡς αὐτὸν Ἀθάμαντος, ἀπένειμε τῆς αὑτοῦ τῷ Ἀθάμαντι τήν τε περὶ τὸ Λαφύστιον χώραν καὶ τὴν νῦν Κορώνειαν καὶ Ἁλιαρτίαν.	When Athamas joined him, he assigned to him, of his own land, the territory round Mount Laphystius with what are now the territories of Coroneia and Haliartus.
ὁσα δὲ ἔσω Ῥήγνυται, ἄριστά ἐστιν, ἃ μηδὲν τῷ ἔξω χωρίῳ ἐπικοινωνέει, ἀλλ’ ἔστι προσεσταλμένα τε καὶ ἀνώδυνα·	Of such as break internally, the best are those which have no external communication, but are covered and indolent
ὁ δὲ Λεύκιος δυσαρεστούμενος μὲν τοῖς τόποις, ὁρῶν δ’ ὅτι ταχέως ἀναγκασθήσονται μεταστρατοπεδεύειν οἱ Καρχηδόνιοι διὰ τὸν πορισμὸν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων, εἶχε τὴν ἡσυχίαν, ἀσφαλισάμενος ταῖς ἐφεδρείαις τὰς παρεμβολάς.	But Aemilius, dissatisfied with his position, and seeing that the Carthaginians would soon be obliged to shift their quarters for the sake of supplies, kept quiet in his camps, strengthening both with extra guards.
τιθέμεθα δ’ οὖν τῶν πολλῶν τριγώνων κάλλιστον ἕν, ὑπερβάντες τἆλλα, ἐξ οὗ τὸ ἰσόπλευρον τρίγωνον ἐκ τρίτου συνέστηκεν.	We, however, shall pass over all the rest and postulate as the fairest of the triangles that triangle out of which, when two are conjoined, the equilateral triangle is constructed as a third.
ὁ δὲ Νικίας αἰσθόμενος τοῦτο καὶ ὁρῶν καθ’ ἡμέραν ἐπιδιδοῦσαν τήν τε τῶν πολεμίων ἰσχὺν καὶ τὴν σφετέραν ἀπορίαν, ἔπεμπε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἀγγέλλων πολλάκις μὲν καὶ ἄλλοτε καθ’ ἕκαστα τῶν γιγνομένων, μάλιστα δὲ καὶ τότε, νομίζων ἐν δεινοῖς τε εἶναι καί, εἰ μὴ ὡς τάχιστα ἢ σφᾶς μεταπέμψουσιν ἢ ἄλλους μὴ ὀλίγους ἀποστελοῦσιν, οὐδεμίαν εἶναι σωτηρίαν.	Nicias perceiving this and seeing the strength of the enemy and his own necessities daily increasing, he also sent messengers to Athens, both at other times and often, upon the occasion of every action that passed, and now especially, as finding himself in danger, and that unless they quickly sent for those away that were there already, or sent a great supply unto them, there was no hope of safety.
ἐξ ὧν συνέβαινε γίνεσθαι τὰς πόλεις πλήρεις ἀκρισίας, ταραχῆς, δυσθυμίας.	The result of these measures was that every city was full of confusion, commotion, and despair
ἔδει γὰρ τὸν εἰληφότα ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν μηκέτι ἁμαρτάνειν, ἀλλ̓ ἐν ἁγνείᾳ κατοικεῖν.	For he who has received remission of sin ought never to sin again, but to live in purity.
“φανεῖσθαι δ’ αὐτῷ παντὸς ἀντάξιον ἀγαθοῦ.	and that this will make thee equal in his eyes to any advantageous circumstances whatsoever."
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Στῆτε ἐπὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς καὶ ἴδετε καὶ ἐρωτήσατε τρίβους Κυρίου αἰωνίους, καὶ ἴδετε ποία ἐστὶν ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀγαθή, καὶ βαδίζετε ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ εὑρήσετε ἁγνισμὸν ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν· καὶ εἶπαν Οὐ πορευσόμεθα.	This is what the Lord says: “Stand on the roads, and see, and inquire of the eternal paths of the Lord, and see what is the good way! And proceed in it, and you will find purification for your souls.” But they said, “We will not go.”
σκύτη τοσαῦτα πωλῶν ἔδωκας ἤδη τουτῳὶ κάττυμα παρὰ σεαυτοῦ ταῖς ἐμβάσιν φάσκων φιλεῖν;	that alone shows up the man; but i, i have bought you this pair of shoes; accept them. he gives demos the shoes;
μέγεθος δὲ ἡλίκον ἰχθύος ὀφθαλμὸς εὐμεγέθης.	And in size the pearl resembles a large fish's eye.
ὡς δ’ αὕτως καὶ τὰ στόμια ἐμφράττειν, τὰ δ’ ἀνοίγειν·	he likewise stopped up some of the mouths, and opened others.
Ὅμοιοί εἰσιν παιδίοις τοῖς ἐν ἀγορᾷ καθημένοις, καὶ προσφωνοῦσιν ἀλλήλοις, καὶ λέγουσιν, Ηὐλήσαμεν ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ ὠρχήσασθε· ἐθρηνήσαμεν ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλαύσατε.	"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, And you did not dance; We mourned to you, And you did not weep.'
λέγωμεν δή, ἓν εἰ ἔστι, τἆλλα τοῦ ἑνὸς τί χρὴ πεπονθέναι;	Shall we tell, then, what must happen to the things other than one, if one exists?
τῶν νέων τοὺς μαλακοὺς οὐκ ἔστι προτρέψαι ῥᾴδιον· οὐδὲ γὰρ τυρὸν ἀγκίστρῳ λαβεῖν· οἱ δ’ εὐφυεῖς, κἂν ἀποτρέπῃς, ἔτι μᾶλλον ἔχονται τοῦ λόγου.	It is not easy to gain the attention of effeminate young men,—for you cannot take up custard by a hook,—but the ingenuous, even if you discourage them, are the more eager for learning.
Ἡρόδωρος δ’ ὁ Ποντικὸς ἱστορεῖ καὶ τὸν Ἡρακλέα χαίρειν γυπὸς ἐπὶ πράξει φανέντος.	Herodorus Ponticus relates that Hercules also was glad to see a vulture present itself when he was upon an exploit.
ἔφη γάρ που Γοργίαν ἐρωτώμενον ὑπὸ σοῦ, ἐὰν ἀφίκηται παρ’ αὐτὸν μὴ ἐπιστάμενος τὰ δίκαια ὁ τὴν ῥητορικὴν βουλόμενος μαθεῖν, εἰ διδάξοι αὐτὸν ὁ Γοργίας, αἰσχυνθῆναι αὐτὸν καὶ φάναι διδάξειν διὰ τὸ ἔθος τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅτι ἀγανακτοῖεν ἂν εἴ τις μὴ φαίη διὰ δὴ ταύτην τὴν ὁμολογίαν ἀναγκασθῆναι ἐναντία αὐτὸν αὑτῷ εἰπεῖν, σὲ δὲ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἀγαπᾶν καί σου καταγελᾶν, ὥς γέ μοι δοκεῖν ὀρθῶς, τότε·	For he said, I think, when you asked Gorgias whether, supposing a man came to him with no knowledge of justice but a desire to learn rhetoric, he would instruct the man, Gorgias showed some shame and said he would, because of the habit of mind in people which would make them indignant if refused—and so, because of this admission, he was forced to contradict himself, and that was just what suited you—and Polus was right, to my thinking, in mocking at you as he did then
τῶν δ’ ἄλλων ἐάν τις πίῃ, θάνατος ἡ ζημία.	And if any one else drinks of it, the punishment is death.
κἀγχειριδίου δ’ ἀκόνῃ σκληρᾷ παραθηγομένης βρύχεις κοπίδος, δηχθεὶς αἴθωνι Κλέωνι.	If the tiniest knife is but laid on the stone To give it an edge, thou gnashest thy teeth, As if bitten by fiery Cleon.
δῆλον δέ γε ὅτι πρὶν γενέσθαι αὐτὸ κακὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ κακοῦ οὗ ἔχει.	But clearly this must be before it is itself made evil by the evil which it has
εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ οἳ, δειχθῆναι παρόντων αὐτῶν τοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν νεφρῶν εἰς τὴν κύστιν ἐμφυομένους οὐρητῆρας ὑπομείναντες, ἐτόλμησαν εἰπεῖν, οἱ μὲν, ὅτι μάτην καὶ οὗτοι γεγόνασιν, οἱ δ’, ὅτι σπερματικοί τινές εἰσι πόροι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο κατὰ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς, οὐκ εἰς τὸ κῦτος ἐμφύονται.	And some of them who had allowed themselves to be shown the ureters coming from the kidneys and becoming implanted in the bladder, even had the audacity to say that these also existed for no purpose and others said that they were spermatic ducts, and that this was why they were inserted into the neck of the bladder and not into its cavity.
Θαυμάσαντος δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν φρόνησιν καὶ τὴν σοφίαν τοῦ Ἰωσήπου καὶ πυθομένου, τίνα καὶ τρόπον ἂν προοικονομήσειεν ἐν τοῖς τῆς εὐετηρίας καιροῖς τὰ περὶ τῶν μετὰ ταύτην, ὡς ἂν ἐλαφρότερα γένοιτο τὰ τῆς ἀφορίας,	Amazed at the shrewdness and wisdom of Joseph, the king asked him in what way the harvests in the plentiful years should be administered, so as to make the time of barrenness more bearable.
γενομένου δέ σφισι δείματος, ἔνθα καὶ νῦν Φόβον ὀνομάζουσι τὸ χωρίον, οἱ μὲν ἐς Κρήτην παρὰ Καρμάνορα ἀπετράποντο, τοὺς δὲ ἀνθρώπους ἐν τῇ Αἰγιαλείᾳ νόσος ἐπέλαβε·	Dread coming upon them at the place now named Fear, they turned aside to Carmanor in Crete, and the people of Aegialea were smitten by a plague.
δασύποδα, ἐὰν περιτύχῃς, ἀγόρασον καὶ νηττία ὁπόσα σὺ βούλει καὶ κίχλας καὶ κοψίχους, ὀρνιθάριά τε τῶν ἀγρίων τούτων συχνά·	Buy a rough-footed hare some ducklings too, As many as you like thrushes, and blackbirds, And other small birds there are many wild sorts.
αὐτὸ μὲν γὰρ τὸ φλεγμαῖνον ἔντερον οὔτε τοῦ βάρους οὔτε τῆς δριμύτητος ἀνέχεται τῶν περιττωμάτων καὶ διὰ τοῦτ’ ἐκκρίνειν αὐτὰ σπεύδει καὶ ἀπωθεῖσθαι πορρωτάτω.	the inflamed intestine is unable to support either the weight or the acridity of the waste substances and so does its best to excrete them, in fact to drive them as far away as possible.
νῦν δ’ ἐπειδὴ καὶ ὁ φιλοπονώτατος πόλεμος ἀναπέπαυται, δοκεῖ μοι καὶ ἡ ἐμὴ ψυχὴ ἀναπαύσεώς τινος ἀξιοῦν τυγχάνειν.	But now that this most toilsome war is really over, it seems to me that I, too, am entitled to find some relaxation of spirit.
ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως ὄψεσθε ὅτι καὶ μάλα ἐπιστρεφῶς καὶ ῥητορικῶς αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ Κρωβύλος αὐτίκα μάλα δεῦρο ἀναπηδήσαντες ταῦτα μὲν εἶναι πολλῆς ἀβελτερίας φήσουσιν, ἃ ἐγὼ λέγω, ἀξιώσουσι δέ με μάρτυρας παρασχέσθαι διαρρήδην μαρτυροῦντας, ὅπου ἔπραττεν, ὅπως ἐποίει, ἢ τίς εἶδεν, ἢ τίς ἦν ὁ τρόπος, πρᾶγμα οἶμαι ἀναιδὲς λέγοντες,	and yet you will presently see hegesandrus and his brother crobylus leaping to the platform here and most vehemently and eloquently declaring that what i say is all nonsense. they will demand that i present witnesses to testify explicitly where he did it, how he did it, or who saw him do it, or what sort of an act it was - a shameless demand, i think.
φαρμάκοις γὰρ οὐκ ἔοικεν ἀλλὰ σιτίοις ὑγιεινοῖς ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ, μεθ’ ὑγιείας ἕξιν ἐμποιοῦσα χρηστὴν οἷς ἂν γένηται συνήθης·	For the power of reason is not like drugs, but like wholesome food and, with the assistance of a good natural disposition, it produceth a healthful constitution in all with whom it hath become familiar.
ὄντως δὲ ὁ παλαιὸς οἶνος οὐ πρὸς ἡδονὴν μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς ὑγίειαν προσφορώτερος.	Though in reality old wine is not only more pleasant, but also better for health
ἀκούσας δὲ τῶν ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς διέρρηξέ τε καὶ βαλὼν εἰς πῦρ ἠφάνισε, ζητηθέντας δὲ τόν τε Ἱερεμίαν καὶ τὸν γραμματέα Βαροῦχον ἐκέλευσεν ἀχθῆναι πρὸς αὐτὸν κολασθησομένους.	When the king heard what it contained, he was angry, and tore it, and cast it into the fire, where it was consumed. He also commanded that they should seek for Jeremiah, and Baruch the scribe, and bring them to him, that they might be punished.
κἂν μὲν ἐκεῖνος ὅμοιός σοι γένηται, δικαίως ἀπόλωλας·	And if he turns out to be no better than yourself, you are deservedly ruined
ἔπειτ’ οὐκ ἀθυμητέον τοῖς γεγενημένοις· ὃ γάρ ἐστιν τῶν παρεληλυθότων χείριστον, τοῦτο πρὸς τὰ μέλλοντα βέλτιστον ὑπάρχει.	In the next place, there must be no discouragement over what has happened, because what is worst in the past is the best hope for the future.
ὡς ἐγὼ τοῖς τηλικούτοις ξυγκαθεύδουσ᾽ ἥδομαι.	and i abhor such as you, and i will never, never consent.
ταῦτα πάντα δόγματά ἐστι καὶ ἄλλο οὐδὲν καὶ δόγματα περὶ τῶν ἀπροαιρέτων ὡς ὄντων ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν.	All these are prejudices, and nothing more and prejudices concerning things uncontrollable by Will, as if they could be either good or evil.
Ἐπεὶ δὲ κατέπαυσεν τὰς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ ταραχὰς Τίτος, εἰκάσας τοὺς ἀγροὺς οὓς εἶχον ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις ἀνονήτους ἐσομένους μοι διὰ τὴν μέλλουσαν ἐκεῖ Ῥωμαίων φρουρὰν ἐγκαθέζεσθαι, ἔδωκεν ἑτέραν χώραν ἐν πεδίῳ, μέλλων τε ἀπαίρειν εἰς τὴν Ῥώμην σύμπλουν ἐδέξατο πᾶσαν τιμὴν ἀπονέμων.	But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail along with him, and paid me great respect
ἢν μὲν εἴσω, ξυγκάμπτειν τοὺς δακτύλους οὐ δύνανται·	if inward, the patient cannot at all bend his fingers
ἐξεθείαζέν τε ἑαυτὸν καὶ τὰς τιμὰς οὐκέτ’ ἀνθρωπίνως ἠξίου γίνεσθαι παρὰ τῶν ὑπηκόων αὐτῷ·	He also asserted his own divinity, and insisted on greater honors to be paid him by his subjects than are due to mankind.
Γαλλιηνοῦ δ’ ἐφ’ ὅλοις ἐνιαυτοῖς πεντεκαίδεκα ἴ’ τὴν ἀρχὴν κεκρατηκότος, Κλαύδιος κατέστη διάδοχος.	Gallienus having held the prineipate for fifteen entire years, Claudius was established as his successor.
Προσθεὶς γὰρ ταύτην τὴν ὀλυμπιάδα φησίν· ἐπὶ ταύτης Πτολεμαῖος ὁ Λάγου ἐνίκα κατὰ Γάζαν μάχῃ Δημήτριον τὸν Ἀντιγόνου τὸν ἐπικληθέντα Πολιορκητήν. Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ τεθνάναι πάντες ὁμολογοῦσιν ἐπὶ τῆς ἑκατοστῆς τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτης ὀλυμπιάδος. Δῆλον οὖν, ὅτι καὶ κατ' ἐκεῖνον καὶ κατὰ Ἀλέξανδρον ἤκμαζεν ἡμῶν τὸ ἔθνος.	For in reference to this Olympiad he says, that "in this Olympiad Ptolemy, son of Lagus, defeated Demetrius, son of Antigonus, who was named Poliorcetes, in battle at Gaza." Now all agree that Alexander died in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad, so it is clear that our nation flourished at his time, under Alexander.
βράδιον γὰρ ἀπέλυον οἱ γονεῖς τὴν θυγατέρα καὶ τῆς ἡμέρας τριβὴν ἐποιοῦντο.	for his wife's parents were loath to part with their daughter, and delayed the time till the day was gone.
τὰ μὲν ἱέρ’ ἡμῖν ἐστιν ὦρνιθες καλά·	Birds! the sacrifice is propitious.
ἐνταῦθα ἔμειναν ἡμέρας τρεῖς καὶ τῶν τετρωμένων ἕνεκα καὶ ἅμα ἐπιτήδεια πολλὰ εἶχον, ἄλευρα, οἶνον, κριθὰς ἵπποις συμβεβλημένας πολλάς. ταῦτα δὲ συνενηνεγμένα ἦν τῷ σατραπεύοντι τῆς χώρας.	In these villages they remained for three days, not only for the sake of the wounded, but likewise because they had provisions in abundance—flour, wine, and great stores of barley that had been collected for horses, all these supplies having been gathered together by the acting satrap of the district.
τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ πολλὰ ἐλάλει ὁ Κῦρος·	In this way Cyrus often chattered on.
ἐνοχλούντων δὲ τῷ Φωκίωνι τῶν Ἀθηναίων ὅπως ἀπαλλάξῃ τὴν φρουρὰν πείσας τὸν Ἀντίπατρον, εἴτε μὴ προσδοκῶν πείσειν εἴτε μᾶλλον ὁρῶν σωφρονοῦντα τὸν δῆμον καὶ πολιτευόμενον εὐτάκτως διὰ τὸν φόβον, ἐκείνην μὲν ἀεὶ διωθεῖτο τὴν πρεσβείαν, τὰ δὲ χρήματα μὴ πράττειν, ἀλλὰ μέλλειν καὶ ἀναβάλλεσθαι τὸν Ἀντίπατρον ἔπεισε.	When the Athenians importuned Phocion to go and persuade Antipater to remove the garrison, whether it was because he despaired of persuading him, or because he saw that the people were more sensible and conducted public affairs with more decorum when they were thus under the influence of fear, he continually rejected that mission he did, however, persuade Antipater not to exact the moneys due from the city, but to delay, and postpone their payment.
ἕλκεα μὲν ἐξ ἀποστάσιος μήκιστα, ἠδὲ δυσαλθέ απάντα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου.	The ulcerations from abscess in man are all very protracted, and difficult to cure.
ὥσπερ τοίνυν ἐγὼ ταῦτα δεικνύω τὰ ψηφίσματα, οὕτω καὶ σὺ δεῖξον, Αἰσχίνη, ὁποῖον ἐγὼ γράψας ψήφισμα αἴτιός εἰμι τοῦ πολέμου.	As I cite these decrees, Aeschines, you must cite some decree by proposing which I became responsible for the war.
Λεοντῖνοι δὲ εὐθὺς καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ἐς τὴν Μεσσήνην ὡς κεκακωμένην ἐστράτευον, καὶ προσβάλλοντες οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι κατὰ τὸν λιμένα ταῖς ναυσὶν ἐπείρων, ὁ δὲ πεζὸς πρὸς τὴν πόλιν.	Hereupon the Leontines and their confederates, together with the Athenians, marched presently against Messana, as being now weakened, and assaulted it, the Athenians with their fleet by the haven and the land-forces at the wall to the field.
ὑπὲρ ὧν Ἱερώνυμος ἁθροίσας τὸ συνέδριον ἀνέδωκε διαβούλιον τί δεῖ ποιεῖν.	Hieronymus thereupon summoned a meeting of his council and consulted them as to what he was to do.
ἔφερον δ’ οἳ μὲν οἰνοχόην χρυσῆν, οἳ δὲ καρχήσιον.	And some of them bore golden wine-jars, and others bore goblets.
ὥστ’ εἰ μηδενὸς ἄλλου ἕνεκα, διὰ ταῦτα καταψηφιστέον.	For this, if for no other, reason you ought to convict.
ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Γοργόνα τὸ ξίφος ὡς ζῶσαν ἕλκει, καὶ παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ μανθάνει ὅτι κενὸν εἴδωλόν ἐστι.	And Hercules drew his sword against the Gorgon, as if she were alive, but he learned from Hermes that she was an empty phantom.
ἰὼ γάμοι γάμοι Πάριδος ὀλέθριοι φίλων.	Ah me, the nuptials, the nuptials of Paris, the deadly to friends!
γράμματα πρὸς Καίσαρα διεπέμψατο, λέγων τὸν Ἀντίοχον μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς Ἐπιφανοῦς διεγνωκέναι Ῥωμαίων ἀφίστασθαι συνθήκας πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Πάρθων πεποιημένον:	sent a letter to Caesar, stating that Antiochus and his son Epiphanes planned to rebel against the Romans and had made a treaty with the king of Parthia to that effect.
εἰ οὖν εἴη αὕτη ἡ πλευρὰ δυοῖν ποδοῖν καὶ αὕτη δυοῖν, πόσων ἂν εἴη ποδῶν τὸ ὅλον;	Now if this side were two feet and that also two, how many feet would the whole be?
τοιαῦτα λέγοντα οἱ δορυφόροι δήσαντες αὐτὸν εἷλκον ἐπὶ τὸν καταπέλτην·	While he was saying these words, the guards, after binding him, dragged him onto the catapult,
ὡς ἐργασείων οὐδὲν ὧν λέγω θροεῖς.	Your words show no willingness to do as I say.
ἀνηγορεύθησαν δὲ νικῶντες Κεφαλήν τε Μελάμπους κιθαρῳδίᾳ καὶ αὐλῳδὸς Ἀρκὰς Ἐχέμβροτος, Σακάδας δὲ Ἀργεῖος ἐπὶ τοῖς αὐλοῖς·	The conquerors proclaimed were Melampus, a Cephallenian, for harping, and Echembrotus, an Arcadian, for singing to the flute, with Sacadas of Argos for flute-playing.
ἐρομένῳ δ' εἴ τι καὶ περὶ τοῦ παιδὸς ἔχοι λέγειν αὐτὸς μὲν ἔφασκεν εὐθὺς ὁρμῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὸν τῆς τροπῆς τῶν πολεμίων γενομένης, ἀκοῦσαι δὲ μεγάλης φωνῆς διωκόντων τὸν Ἀψάλωμον καὶ πλεῖον τούτου μηδὲν δεδυνῆσθαι μαθεῖν διὰ τὸ πεμφθέντα ὑπὸ Ἰωάβου δηλῶσαι τὴν νίκην ἐπείγεσθαι.	When he enquired what news he had about his son, he said that he had left immediately after the enemy was defeated, but that he heard a great shout from the men pursuing Absalom but that he could learn no more, as he was sent by Joab to report the victory.
πλὴν Χαλὲβ υἱὸς Ἰεφοννὴ ὁ διακεχωρισμένος, καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυή, ὅτι συνεπηκολούθησεν ὀπίσω Κυρίου.	except for Caleb son of Jephunneh, who is set apart, and Joshua the son of Nun, because he carefully followed after the Lord.’
ὁ δ’ ἀναγκασθεὶς Μεταλίαν τὴν θυγατέρα προσῆγεν·	Forced by necessity, he brought forward his daughter Metella.
παραγενόμενος δὲ Νικίας καὶ Νικομένης καὶ ἄλλοι τινές, ὁρῶντες τὰ πράγματα οὐχ οἷα βέλτιστα ἐν τῇ πόλει ὄντα, ἄγειν μὲν τὸν Ἀγόρατον οὐκ ἔφασαν προήσεσθαι, ἀφῃροῦντο δὲ καὶ ἠγγυῶντο καὶ ὡμολόγουν παρέξειν εἰς τὴν βουλήν.	On the spot were Nicias, Nicomenes and some others, who, seeing that the business was not going very successfully in the city, refused to allow Agoratus to be taken they were for releasing him and giving bail, and undertook to produce him before the Council.
Οἱ δὲ συνελογίσαντο πρὸς ἑαυτούς, λέγοντες ὅτι Ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, Ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ, Διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ;	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
ἐν δὲ τῇσι μεταβολῇσι τῶν πνευμάτων διὰ τάδε φημὶ επιλήπτους γίνεσθαι, καὶ μάλιστα τοῖσι νοτίοισιν, ἔπειτα τοῖσι βορείοισιν, ἔπειτα τοῖσι λοιποῖσι πνεύμασι·	Therefore, they are attacked during changes of the winds, and especially south winds, then also with north winds, and afterwards also with the others.
‘τὰ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου καὶ τῶν ἑκατέροις ὑπαρχόντων ὡς οὐκ ἀσθενέστερα ἕξομεν γνῶτε καθ’ ἕκαστον ἀκούοντες.	As to the war and the resources of either party, a detailed comparison will not show you the inferiority of Athens.
νομοθέτου ἄρα ἔργῳ χρήσεται ὁ διδασκαλικὸς ὅταν ὀνόματι χρῆται;	Then the teacher, when he uses a name, will be using the work of a lawgiver?
Ἀπειρηκότες δὲ τοῖς κακοῖς οἱ πεπειραμένοι καὶ τοῖς ἀκούουσιν αὐτὰ διδασκαλία γινόμενοι τοῦ μὴ προσδέξασθαι τὴν κιβωτόν ποτε πρὸς αὑτοὺς ἐπὶ τοιούτῳ μισθῷ καὶ τέλει, τὸ λοιπὸν ἐζήτουν μηχανὴν καὶ πόρον ἀπαλλαγῆς αὐτῆς.	When those who experienced these woes were exhausted by them and those who heard about them learned not to admit the ark among them, since they paid so dear a tax for it, they finally looked for ways and means to be rid of it.
ἑκόντες δὲ ποιοῦσιν ὅσα εἰδότες καὶ μὴ ἀναγκαζόμενοι.	Men act voluntarily when they know what they do, and do not act under compulsion.
καὶ τί ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ ταἴτιον;	whatever is the reason?
σὺν χρόνῳ δ’ ἐπισύροντες ἢ διαφθείροντες, ἢ ἐς τὴν Ἀλβανῶν σύγκρισιν, Ἀλβησέας αὐτοὺς καλοῦσιν.	Its inhabitants with the lapse of time, either because of carelessness of pronunciation or corruption of language, or to distinguish them from the Albanians, were called Albenses.
παραρρεῖ δὲ ὁμώνυμος τῇ πόλει ποταμός.	A river of the same name flows by this city.
τοῦτο γὰρ μάλιστα τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ μέρος, ᾧ πιστεύομεν, ἁλώσιμόν ἐστιν.	for that part of the soul with which we trust is most easily taken captive.
χωρὶς δὲ τούτων ὀκτακοσίας δραχμὰς κατ’ ἄνδρα διένειμεν ἀπὸ τῶν λαφύρων.	Besides this, he gave to each man eight hundred drachmas from the general spoils.
ὥσθ’ ὁμοίως ἡμῖν φιλονικητέον ἐστὶν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐνθάδε ψηφισθησομένων, ὥσπερ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἀγώνων.	Wherefore we should strive for success in the measures to be adopted here with an emulation no less keen than we show in the lists of war.
ὄνομα δὲ ἦν τῇ πόλει Μέσπιλα· Μῆδοι δ’ αὐτήν ποτε ᾤκουν.	The name of this city was Mespila, and it was once inhabited by the Medes.
λελήθαμεν δ’ ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς εἰς θαυμαστὸν λόγον ἐμπεπτωκότες.	but we have plunged unawares into a wondrous argument.
ἴθι νυν κατάστειλόν με τὰ περὶ τὼ σκέλει.	now some rings for my legs.
τῶν οὖν μετανοούντων εὐθὺς δοκεῖς τὰς ἁμαρτιας ἀφίεσθαι;	do you then think that the sins of those who repent are immediately forgiven?
ἔζησεν δὲ Ἀδὰμ διακόσια καὶ τριάκοντα ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησεν κατὰ τὴν εἰδέαν αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σήθ.	Adam lived two hundred and thirty years and fathered a child according to his appearance and according to his image, and ⌊he gave him the name Seth⌋.
Διονυσίου δὲ προσπτύσαντος αὐτῷ ἠνέσχετο. μεμψαμένου δέ τινος, εἶτα οἱ μὲν ἁλιεῖς, εἶπεν, ὑπομένουσι ῥαίνεσθαι τῇ θαλάττῃ, ἵνα κωβιὸν θηράσωσιν· ἐγὼ δὲ μὴ ἀνάσχωμαι κράματι ῥανθῆναι, ἵνα βλέννοι λάβω;	He bore with Dionysius when he spat on him, and to one who took him to task he replied, If the fishermen let themselves be drenched with sea-water in order to catch a gudgeon, ought I not to endure to be wetted with negus in order to take a blenny?
μὴ τάχυν’ ἄνευ δίκης ἡγοῦ σὺ θᾶσσον, οὐ γὰρ ὡς ἔοικέ μοι σχολῆς τόδ’ ἔργον·	Seek not to outrun justice. To his attendant. Forward! faster, faster!
Γενομένης δέ μου ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ καὶ δειπνησάσης ἡ ψυχή μου εἰς ὑποψίαν τινὰ ὑπέβαλέν μοι, καὶ μάλιστα ὅτι δυσὶ μορφαῖς ὤφθη μοι·	And when I was in mine house and had dined my soul suggested unto me some suspicion, and especially because he was seen of me in two forms
αἱ μὲν γὰρ πλεῖσται πόλεις ἀφεῖσαι παιδεύειν ὅπως τις ἐθέλει τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας, καὶ αὐτοὺς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὅπως ἐθέλουσι διάγειν, ἔπειτα προστάττουσιν αὐτοῖς μὴ κλέπτειν μηδὲ ἁρπάζειν, μὴ βίᾳ εἰς οἰκίαν παριέναι, μὴ παίειν ὃν μὴ δίκαιον, μὴ μοιχεύειν, μὴ ἀπειθεῖν ἄρχοντι, καὶ τἆλλα τὰ τοιαῦτα ὡσαύτως·	For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please and then they command them not to steal and not to rob, not to break into anybody’s house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, not to commit adultery, not to disobey an officer, and so forth
καὶ τεχνάζων ἔτι ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα διεπρεσβεύετο πρὸς αὐτόν, ἐπιτρέπων ἐκείνῳ καὶ φίλον εἶναι διδοὺς καὶ σύμμαχον, ἔργῳ δὲ τὰ Ἀντωνίου κατασκεπτόμενος.	Scheming with both projects, he sent ambassadors to Antony ostensibly to place himself at the latter's disposal and to offer himself as a friend and ally, but really to get accurate information about Antony's affairs.
τὰ γὰρ περὶ τοὺς Σάββα παῖδας ἐσπουδάσθη μὲν αὐτῷ πρότερον ἐπεξελθεῖν αὐτοὺς δυσμενεῖς γενομένους τῇ διαθέσει, τότε δὲ διὰ τὸ μῆκος τοῦ χρόνου καὶ τῆς μνήμης ἐξεληλύθεσαν.	As for the fact relating to these sons of Babas, Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punishment, as being enemies to his government but they were now forgotten by him, on account of the length of time [since he had ordered them to be slain].
κάθηρον τὰ δόγματα, μή τι προσήρτηταί σοι τῶν οὐ σῶν, μή τι συμπέφυκεν, μή τι ὀδυνήσει σ’ ἀποσπώμενον.	Correct your principles. Permit nothing to cleave to you that is not your own nothing to grow to you that may give you agony when it is torn away.
Εἰ γὰρ ἐχθροὶ ὄντες κατηλλάγημεν τῷ θεῷ διὰ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, πολλῷ μᾶλλον καταλλαγέντες σωθησόμεθα ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ·	For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
καίτοι συμβαίνει γ’ ἐναντίως· οὐ γὰρ εὔλογον οὕτως.	The fact, however, is just the reverse, and the theory is illogical
οὐ μὴν ἀλλά, πολλὰ κινουμένου τοῦ Θεμιστοκλέους παραβόλως καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν αὐτῷ πολιτείαν ἐνισταμένου καὶ διακόπτοντος, ἠναγκάζετό που καὶ αὐτὸς τὰ μὲν ἀμυνόμενος, τὰ δὲ κολούων τὴν ἐκείνου δύναμιν χάριτι τῶν πολλῶν αὐξομένην ὑπεναντιοῦσθαι οἷς ἔπραττεν ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς, βέλτιον ἡγούμενος παρελθεῖν ἔνια τῶν συμφερόντων τὸν δῆμον ἢ τῷ κρατεῖν ἐκεῖνον ἐν πᾶσιν ἰσχυρὸν γενέσθαι.	However, since Themistocles was a reckless agitator, and opposed and thwarted him in every measure of state, Aristides himself also was almost compelled—partly in self-defence, and partly to curtail his adversary’s power, which was increasing through the favour of the many—to set himself in opposition to what Themistocles was trying to do, thinking it better that some advantages should escape the people than that his adversary, by prevailing everywhere, should become too strong.
Τίς αὕτη ἡ ἀναβαίνουσα ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου, ὡς στελέχη καπνοῦ τεθυμιαμένη σμύρναν καὶ λίβανον ἀπὸ πάντων κονιορτῶν μυρεψοῦ;	Who is this woman coming up from the desert like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, from all the powders of a perfumer?
τὸν δὲ παρασάγγην τὸν περσικὸν οἱ μὲν ἑξήκοντα σταδίων φασίν, οἱ δὲ τριάκοντα ἢ τετταράκοντα.	The Persian parasang some say contains 60, others 30 or 40, stadia.
περιεπείροντο δὲ τοῖς ἐκείνων βέλεσι καὶ τοῖς ἀγριωτάτοις παραπλήσιοι θηρίοις ὥρμων ἐπὶ τὸν σίδηρον, διεφθείροντο δ' οἱ μὲν κατὰ στόμα παιόμενοι τοῖς ξίφεσιν, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν ἱππέων σκεδαννύμενοι.	while they were themselves run through by Roman spears, and, like wild beasts, rushed upon the point of others' swords, so that some of them were killed, run through the mouth by their enemies' swords, and others were scattered by the cavalry.
ἄλλως γὰρ ἂν ἄμαχοι γυναῖκες καὶ μιαραὶ κεκλῄμεθ᾽ ἄν.	ah, strymodorus, who'd have thought affairs could tangle so?
οὐκοῦν οὐκ ἄξιον τὰ τούτου ἀδικήματα αὐτοὺς ἀναδέχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ τιμωρεῖσθαι τὸν ἀδικοῦντα.	It is not therefore right to take upon yourselves this man's misdeeds. On the contrary the transgressor must be punished.
οὐχ εὑρὼν δ' ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὁ Γοργίας, ἀλλ' ὑπονοήσας ἀναχωρήσαντας αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι κεκρύφθαι, πορευθεὶς ἔγνω ζητεῖν, ὅπου ποτ' εἶεν.	When Gorgias did not find the enemy in their camp, he thought they had retreated and hidden themselves in the mountains, and decided to go and seek them wherever they might be.
Ἰκαρίων δ’ ὑπὲρ πελαγέων μολὼν ἄναξ Ἀπόλλων ὁ Δάλιος, εὔγνωστος ἐμοὶ ξυνείης διὰ παντὸς εὔφρων.	And may Apollo, lord of Delos, step over the Icarian sea and join me in his divine form, in eternal benevolence!
Πλάγκος δὲ προσεγένετο μετὰ τοῦ οἰκείου στρατοῦ, καὶ ὁ Δέκμος ἐπέστελλε τῇ βουλῇ τὸν Ἀντώνιον ἀλώμενον κυνηγετήσειν ναυτικῶν περ ἤδη γεγονότων.	Plancus soon joined him with his army, and then Decimus wrote to the Senate that he would pursue and capture Antony immediately.
ποῖ γὰρ τράπωμαι πατρίδος ἐκβεβλημένη;	For where can I turn, banished from my father-land?
αὐτὸς γὰρ περὶ αὐτοῦ τοὐναντίον ἐψεύδετο καὶ γεγενημένος ἐν Ὀάσει τῆς Αἰγύπτου πάντων Αἰγυπτίων πρῶτος ὤν, ὡς ἂν εἴποι τις, τὴν μὲν ἀληθῆ πατρίδα καὶ τὸ γένος ἐξωμόσατο, Ἀλεξανδρεὺς δὲ εἶναι καταψευδόμενος ὁμολογεῖ τὴν μοχθηρίαν τοῦ γένους.	The man even lies about himself; for although he was born in the Egyptian oasis, a prototype Egyptian one could say, he denies his real country and ancestors and falsely claims to be from Alexandria, though he must admit the lowliness of his family.
τὰ δὲ ἐφ’ ἡμῶν στεφάνους μὲν τῶν ἀσταχύων ἀποτίθενται παρὰ τῇ θεῷ, λουσάμενοι δὲ τῷ ποταμῷ καὶ αὖθις στεφάνους ἐπιθέμενοι κισσοῦ πρὸς τὸ ἱερὸν ἴασι τοῦ Αἰσυμνήτου.	But at the present day they lay aside the garlands of corn-ears by the goddess, and after bathing in the river and putting on fresh garlands, this time made of ivy, they go to the sanctuary of the Dictator.
διὰ τί δῆτα κλαύσομαι;	For what, pray, shall I weep?
τῆς δὲ τοῦ ὄντος θέας, οἵαν ἡδονὴν ἔχει, ἀδύνατον ἄλλῳ γεγεῦσθαι πλὴν τῷ φιλοσόφῳ.	but it is impossible for anyone except the lover of wisdom to have savored the delight that the contemplation of true being and reality brings.
Ἐν δὲ τούτῳ καὶ ὁ Ἐπιφανὴς Ἀντίοχος παρῆν ἄλλους τε ὁπλίτας συχνοὺς ἔχων καὶ περὶ αὑτὸν στῖφος Μακεδόνων καλούμενον, ἥλικας πάντας, ὑψηλούς, ὀλίγον ὑπὲρ ἀντίπαιδας, τὸν Μακεδονικὸν τρόπον ὡπλισμένους τε καὶ πεπαιδευμένους, ὅθεν καὶ τὴν ἐπίκλησιν εἶχον ὑστεροῦντες οἱ πολλοὶ τοῦ γένους.	Meanwhile, Antiochus Epiphanes arrived in the city, him a large retinue of warriors and the so-called Macedonian troop, all of the same age, tall and just out of adolescence, armed and trained in the Macedonian style, from which they took the name, though many of them were unworthy of that nation.
ταῦτα Παυσανίας ἀκούων, ἤδη δὲ καὶ καθορῶν ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἀκοντισμάτων καὶ τοξευμάτων πλήθει τὸ στρατόπεδον τῶν Μεγαρέων καὶ συνεσταλμένους αὐτοὺς εἰς ὀλίγον, αὐτὸς μὲν ἀμήχανος ἦν πρὸς ἱππότας ἀμύνειν ὁπλιτικῇ φάλαγγι καὶ βαρείᾳ τῇ Σπαρτιατῶν,	Pausanias, on hearing this, and seeing at once that the camp of the Megarians was as good as hidden from view by the multitude of the enemy’s javelins and arrows, and that its defenders were huddled together in narrow quarters, on his own part had no way of rendering them aid against horsemen, since his phalanx of Spartans was full-armored and slow of movement
ἱκανὴ γὰρ ἡ τύχη τοῖς παρὰ λόγον τὰ κατὰ λόγον ἐπιτρῖψαι, κἄν τινι συνεργήσῃ καὶ προσθῆται τὴν αὑτῆς ῥοπήν, αὖθις οἷον ἐκ μεταμελείας ἀντισηκοῦν καὶ λυμαίνεσθαι τὰ κατορθώματα παρὰ πόδας.	For it is quite the way of Fortune to confound human calculations by surprises and when she has helped a man for a time, and caused her balance to incline in his favour, to turn round upon him as though she repented, throw her weight into the opposite scale, and mar all his successes.
ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς τούτων μὲν οὐδενὶ προσέσχε, μεταπεμψάμενος δὲ τὸν νεανίσκον διελύσατο τὴν ἔχθραν, ἀφῆκε δὲ τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν χρημάτων, ἃ συνέβαινε τὸν πατέρα προσοφείλειν αὐτῷ τῶν φόρων. λαβὼν δὲ παραχρῆμα τριακόσια τάλαντα παρ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ χιλίους ἵππους καὶ χιλίους ἡμιόνους μετὰ τῆς ἐπισκευῆς τά τε κατὰ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἅπαντ’ ἀποκατέστησε, καὶ συνοικίσας αὐτῷ τὴν ἀδελφὴν Ἀντιοχίδα πάντας τοὺς ἐκείνων τῶν τόπων ἐψυχαγώγησε καὶ προσεκαλέσατο, δόξας μεγαλοψύχως καὶ βασιλικῶς τοῖς πράγμασι κεχρῆσθαι.	The king, however, would not listen to any of these suggestions but sent for the young prince and accommodated their differences, forgiving him the larger part of the money which he allowed to be owing from his father under the head of tribute, and accepting a present payment from him of three hundred talents, a thousand horses, and a thousand mules with their trappings. He then settled the government of the city, and gave the prince his sister Antiochis as a wife.
ἐντεῦθεν ἦν Κλεάνθης, ὁ στωικὸς φιλόσοφος, ὁ διαδεξάμενος τὴν Ζήνωνος τοῦ Κιτιέως σχολήν, καταλιπὼν δὲ Χρυσίππῳ τῷ Σολεῖ·	Cleanthes, the Stoic philosopher, was a native of this place. He succeeded to the school of Zeno of Citium, and left it to Chrysippus of Soli.
ἀλλὰ γὰρ σύ, ὦ Ἴων, εἰ μὲν ἀληθῆ λέγεις ὡς τέχνῃ καὶ ἐπιστήμῃ οἷός τε εἶ Ὅμηρον ἐπαινεῖν, ἀδικεῖς, ὅστις ἐμοὶ ὑποσχόμενος ὡς πολλὰ καὶ καλὰ περὶ Ὁμήρου ἐπίστασαι καὶ φάσκων ἐπιδείξειν, ἐξαπατᾷς με καὶ πολλοῦ δεῖς ἐπιδεῖξαι, ὅς γε οὐδὲ ἅττα ἐστὶ ταῦτα περὶ ὧν δεινὸς εἶ ἐθέλεις εἰπεῖν, πάλαι ἐμοῦ λιπαροῦντος,	But in fact, Ion, if you are right in saying it is by art and knowledge that you are able to praise Homer, you are playing me false you have professed to me that you know any amount of fine things about Homer, and you promise to display them but you are only deceiving me, and so far from displaying the subjects of your skill, you decline even to tell me what they are, for all my entreaties.
Οὕτως εἶπεν Κύριος Στῆθι ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ χρηματιεῖς ἅπασι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐρχομένοις προσκυνεῖν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους οὓς συνέταξά σοι αὐτοῖς χρηματίσαι, μὴ ἀφέλῃς ῥῆμα.	This is what the Lord said: “Stand in the court of the house of the Lord and speak to all the Judeans and all who come to worship in the house of the Lord all the words that I commanded you to speak to them; do not hold back a word.
ἐλέγετο δὲ ὅτι καὶ ναύαρχος διάδοχος Πῶλος ὅσον οὐ παρείη ἤδη εἰς Ἑλλήσποντον.	and it was reported that his own successor as admiral, Polus, had by this time all but reached the Hellespont.
οὕτως γὰρ ἐντέταλται ἡμῖν ὁ κύριος· τέθεικά σε εἰς φῶς ἐθνῶν τοῦ εἶναί σε εἰς σωτηρίαν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς.¶	For this is what the Lord has commanded us: 'I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
νῦν δ’ ὡς ἄπεστ’ ἐκεῖνος, οὐδὲν ἐντρέπει ἐμοῦ γε·	But now, since he is absent, you pay me no mind.
ὕλη δὲ ἀλειφάτων μὲν ὁκόσα μοι λέλεκται·	The ingredients of the ointments are such as have been stated by me
ἡ δὲ Ἐπικούρειος ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ κέκληται Ἐπικούρου.	while the Epicurean school took its name from Epicurus himself.
θνητὰ γὰρ καὶ ἀθάνατα ζῷα λαβὼν καὶ συμπληρωθεὶς ὅδε ὁ κόσμος οὕτω, ζῷον ὁρατὸν τὰ ὁρατὰ περιέχον, εἰκὼν τοῦ νοητοῦ θεὸς αἰσθητός, μέγιστος καὶ ἄριστος κάλλιστός τε καὶ τελεώτατος γέγονεν εἷς οὐρανὸς ὅδε μονογενὴς ὤν.	For this our Cosmos has received the living creatures both mortal and immortal and been thereby fulfilled it being itself a visible Living Creature embracing the visible creatures, a perceptible God made in the image of the Intelligible, most great and good and fair and perfect in its generation—even this one Heaven sole of its kind.
καὶ τὰς θύρας ἐνέφραττον ἕτεροι καὶ ἐνεπίμπρασαν ἄνεμός τε πολὺς ἐμπεσὼν ἐς τοσοῦτον αὐτὴν ἐδαπάνησεν, ὡς μηδὲν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως λάφυρον γενέσθαι.	Still others closed the gates and set fire to the town. A strong wind fanned the flames, which so far consumed the place that no plunder was left in it.
οἳ μὲν γὰρ ἂν μὴ τὸ ἑαυτοῖς, οἳ δὲ ἂν μὴ τὸ εἶναι, οἳ δὲ τὸ συζῆν, οὐκ οἴονται φιλεῖσθαι.	some men do not think they are loved unless the friend wishes them this or that particular good, others unless their existence is desired, others unless their society.
” πειρωμένου δ’ αὐτοῦ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν ναὸν ἐκώλυον αὐτόν.	And as he was aiming to go into the temple, they forbade him so to do
τῇδέ μοι δοκέει καὶ ἡμιπαθέα ἔμμεναι τὰ μέρεα διχῆ ὑπὸ τῆς νοῦσου τετμημένα.	and from this I conclude, that these parts are half affected, as being cut in twain by the disease.
καὶ τούτοις οὐχ ἥκιστα τοῖς πάθεσιν ἐνδείκνυται τὸ ψυχρόν, ὅτι πρὸς τὸ θερμὸν ὡς οὐσία πρὸς οὐσίαν ἢ πάθος πρὸς πάθος οὐχ ὡς ἀπόφασις ἀντίκειται καὶ στέρησις, οὐδὲ φθορὰ τίς ἐστι τοῦ θερμοῦ καὶ ἀναίρεσις ἀλλὰ φθαρτικὴ φύσις καὶ δύναμις.	and it is chiefly by these effects that cold is shown to be in opposition to heat, not as a negation or privation, but as one substance or one state to another it is not a mere destruction or abolition of heat, but a positive substance or force.
ὁ δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὸ τοιοῦτον πολλὴν τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ἐπῆγεν, ἀφαιρούμενος μὲν τὰς εὐκαιρίας, ἐπιτάττων δ' ἀεὶ γίνεσθαι πρὸς τοῖς πόνοις, ἦν δ' οὔτε σύνοδος ἐφειμένη τοῖς περὶ τὴν πόλιν οὔτε κοινωνία περιπάτου καὶ διαίτης, ἀλλ' ἐτετήρητο τὰ πάντα.	He was on guard against such critics, forestalling any chance of them disturbing him by having them always at work, and he did not allow the citizens to meet in groups, or to walk or eat together, but watched all that they did and when any were caught, they were severely punished.
ἄξιον δ’ ἐστὶ καὶ τῷ νόμῳ βοηθεῖν καθ’ ὃν ἔξεστιν ἡμῖν καὶ παῖδας εἰσποιήσασθαι καὶ βουλεύσασθαι περὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων αὐτῶν, ἐνθυμηθέντας ὅτι τοῖς ἐρήμοις τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀντὶ παίδων οὗτός ἐστιν·	It is expedient, to, that you should uphold the law which permits us to adopt children and to dispose wisely of our property, reflecting that for men who are childless this law takes the place of children
τί λέγεις αὐτόν;	What mean you by him?
Ἀντιφῶν Σοφίλου μὲν ἧν πατρὸς τῶν δὲ δήμων παμνούσιος·	Antiphon was the son of Sophilus, and his deme was Rhamnus.
οὐ ταῦτα λέξεις, ἡνίκ’ ἂν λεύσσῃς μ’ ἐκεῖ.	Thou wilt tell a different tale when thou seest me there.
Μετὰ δὲ τὴν τούτων τελευτὴν Φινεέσης προφητεύει κατὰ τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ βούλησιν ἐπ' ἐξωλείᾳ τοῦ Χαναναίων γένους τῇ Ἰούδα φυλῇ παρασχεῖν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν: καὶ γὰρ τῷ λαῷ διὰ σπουδῆς ἦν μαθεῖν τί καὶ τῷ θεῷ δοκεῖ. καὶ προσλαβοῦσα τὴν Σεμεωνίδα, ἐφ' ᾧτε ἐξαιρεθέντων τῶν ἐκείνης ὑποτελῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ κληρουχίᾳ τοῦτο ποιῶσιν.	When they had died, Phineas prophesied that in order to wipe out the Canaanite race God willed them to entrust the leadership to the tribe of Judas, for at that time the people wanted to learn what was the will of God. They also enlisted the tribe of Simeon so that when those assigned to Judas's tribe had been uprooted, the tribe of Simeon should do likewise.
Καὶ σὺ μὴ προσεύχου περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ μὴ ἀξίου τοῦ ἐλεηθῆναι αὐτούς, καὶ μὴ εὔχου καὶ μὴ προσέλθῃς μοι περὶ αὐτῶν, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσακούσομαι.	“And as for you, do not pray for this people, and ⌊do not consider them worthy of pity⌋. And do not pray and do not come to me about them, because I will not listen.
ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐξέπιον τὰς φιάλας, ἐν χαλκῷ πίνακι τῶν Κορινθίων κατασκευασμάτων ἄρτος ἑκάστῳ ἰσόπλατυς ἐδόθη, ὄρνεις τε καὶ νῆσσαι, προσέτι δὲ καὶ φάτται καὶ χὴν καὶ τοιαύτη τις ἄλλη ἀφθονία σεσωρευμένη, καὶ ἕκαστος λαβὼν αὐτῷ πίνακι τοῖς κατόπιν διεδίδου παισίν.	And when they had emptied the bowls, then there was given to each of the guests a loaf in a brazen platter of Corinthian workmanship, of the. same size and poultry, and ducks, and besides that, pigeons, and a goose, and quantities more of the same kind of food heaped up abundantly. And each of the guests taking what was set before him, with the brazen platter itself also, gave it to the slaves who waited behind him.
ὑμᾶς δέ, ὦ ἄνδρες, οὐκ εἰκός ἐστι τῷ τοὔτου γένει προσέχειν τὸν νοῦν·	There is little likelihood, however, gentlemen, of your paying any attention to his claim of kinship
εἶτα αὖθις ἀλεῇναι τὸ πᾶν, ἐς τὸ τὰς ἀφόδους ξηραίνειν.	and then again, apply calefacients to the whole system, so as to dry up the passages
ἐφ’ ἑκάστῃ δὲ τῇ φυλῇ κήρυκα κηρύττειν, ὅτῳ δοκοῦσιν ἀδικεῖν οἱ στρατηγοὶ οὐκ ἀνελόμενοι τοὺς νικήσαντας ἐν τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ, εἰς τὴν προτέραν ψηφίσασθαι, ὅτῳ δὲ μή, εἰς τὴν ὑστέραν·	and that in each tribe a herald proclaim that whoever adjudges the generals guilty, for not picking up the men who won the victory in the naval battle, shall cast his vote in the first urn, and whoever adjudges them not guilty, shall cast his vote in the second
ἅνδρες ἐγγύς.	they are coming on
ἀνάγνωθι καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ψήφισμ’ αὐτοῖς. ΨΗΦΙΣΜΑ.	Read this decree also to the court. [The decree is read]
ἐγὼ δὲ γελάσας ἐκεῖνον δ’ εἶπον ὦ ἑταῖρε, τὸν ἐκ τῆς παροιμίας ἀποκείμενον ἰχθῦν διὰ τί οὐχ ἕλκομεν εἰς μέσον μετὰ τῆς Πυθαγορικῆς χοίνικος, ἐφ’ ἧς ἀπηγόρευε καθῆσθαι, διδάσκων ἡμᾶς ἀεί τι τοῦ παρόντος εἰς τὸ μέλλον ὑπολείπειν καὶ τῆς αὔριον ἐν τῇ σήμερον μνημονεύειν;	Then I with a smile said But, sir, that fish there, that according to the proverb is laid up, why do not we bring out into play together with Pythagoras’s choenix, which he forbids any man to sit upon, thereby teaching us that we ought to leave something of what we have before us for another time, and on the present day be mindful of the morrow?
τοῦ θεοῦ περὶ ἡμῶν κρεῖττόν τι προβλεψαμένου, ἵνα μὴ χωρὶς ἡμῶν τελειωθῶσιν.¶	For God had provided something better for us, so that they would be made perfect together with us.
προῆγε δ’ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πᾶν σὺν αὐτῷ τὸ πλῆθος ὑμνοῦντες τὸν θεὸν καὶ ᾄδοντες πᾶν εἶδος μέλους ἐπιχώριον σύν τε ἤχῳ ποικίλῳ κρουσμάτων τε καὶ ὀρχήσεων καὶ ψαλμῶν ἔτι δὲ σάλπιγγος καὶ κυμβάλων κατάγοντες τὴν κιβωτὸν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα.	Before it went the king, and the whole multitude of the people with him, singing hymns to God, and making use of all sorts of songs usual among them, with variety of the sounds of musical instruments, and with dancing and singing of psalms, as also with the sounds of trumpets and of cymbals, and so brought the ark to Jerusalem.
τὸν γὰρ ἄνδρα ὁμολογῶν τύπτειν τὰς πληγὰς ἐξ ὧν ἀπέθανεν, αὐτὸς μὲν τοῦ τεθνηκότος οὔ φησι φονεὺς εἶναι, ἡμᾶς δὲ τοὺς τιμωροῦντας αὐτῷ ζῶν τε καὶ βλέπων φονέας αὑτοῦ φησιν εἶναι.	Thus, he admits that he gave the man the blows which caused his death yet he not only denies that he himself is the dead man's murderer, but asserts, alive and well though he is, that we, who are seeking vengeance for the victim, are his own murderers.
ἐκεῖ δ’ ἀκούοντες καὶ σοῦ καὶ τῶν τοῦ Λακωνικοῦ αἱρησόμεθα ἃ ἂν κράτιστα δοκῇ εἶναι.	there we shall listen both to you and to the Laconian’s messengers, and make whatever choice may seem to be best.
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀπιόντος αὐτοῦ προσέθεόν τινες καὶ πράγματα αὐτῷ παρεῖχον, ἀχθεσθεὶς παρήγγειλε τοὺς μὲν ἱππέας ἐλᾶν εἰς αὐτοὺς ἐνέντας, καὶ τὰ δέκα ἀφ’ ἥβης συνέπεσθαι·	As he was returning, some of the enemy attacked him and caused him trouble, whereupon, becoming angry, he ordered the cavalry to charge upon them at full speed, and the infantrymen within ten years of military age to follow the cavalry
αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Τιμόθεος ἐμπεσὼν τοῖς περὶ τὸν Δωσίθεον καὶ Σωσίπατρον ἠξίου μετὰ πολλῆς γοητίας ἐξαφεῖναι ὡς σῷον αὐτόν, διὰ τὸ πλειόνων μὲν γονεῖς, ὧν δὲ ἀδελφοὺς ἔχειν, καὶ τούτους ἀλογηθῆναι συμβήσεται·	Now Timothy himself fell into the hands of those with Dositheus and Sosipater. He was entreating them with much trickery to set him free as unharmed because he indeed held the parents of many of them and the kin of others, and it would happen that no regard would be paid to these.
ἔτι εἰ ἅπασα μονὰς καὶ μονὰς ἄλλη δύο, ἡ ἐκ τῆς δυάδος αὐτῆς μονὰς καὶ ἡ ἐκ τῆς τριάδος αὐτῆς δυὰς ἔσται ἐκ διαφερουσῶν τε, καὶ πότερον προτέρα τῆς τριάδος ἢ ὑστέρα; μᾶλλον γὰρ ἔοικε προτέραν ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι· ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἅμα τῇ τριάδι ἡ δ᾽ ἅμα τῇ δυάδι τῶν μονάδων. καὶ ἡμεῖς μὲν ὑπολαμβάνομεν ὅλως ἓν καὶ ἕν, καὶ ἐὰν ᾖ ἴσα ἢ ἄνισα, δύο εἶναι, οἷον τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ κακόν, καὶ ἄνθρωπον καὶ ἵππον·	again, if every unit plus another unit makes 2, a unit from the ideal 2 plus one from the ideal 3 will make 2- a 2 composed of different units; will this be prior or posterior to 3? it rather seems that it must be prior, because one of the units is contemporaneous with 3, and the other with 2. we assume that in general 1 and 1, whether the things are equal or unequal, make 2; e. g. good and bad, or man and horse;
ὃς γενόμενος ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις ἑνδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς Σαχχίου βασιλείας συλᾷ τε τὸν ναὸν καὶ βαστάζει τὰ σκεύη τοῦ θεοῦ χρυσᾶ τε καὶ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸν μέγαν λουτῆρα, ὃν Σολόμων ἀνέθηκεν, ἔτι γε μὴν τοὺς στύλους τοὺς χαλκοῦς καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν τάς τε χρυσᾶς τραπέζας καὶ τὰς λυχνίας.	Accordingly, he came to Jerusalem in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, and pillaged the temple, and carried out the vessels of God, both gold and silver, and particularly that large laver which Solomon dedicated, as also the pillars of brass, and their chapiters, with the golden tables and the candlesticks
τὰς γὰρ ἀρχαιρεσίας Αἰτωλοὶ μὲν ἐποίουν μετὰ τὴν φθινοπωρινὴν ἰσημερίαν εὐθέως, Ἀχαιοὶ δὲ τότε περὶ τὴν τῆς Πλειάδος ἐπιτολήν.	For the Aetolians hold their elections immediately after the autumn equinox, while the Achaeans hold theirs about the time of the rising of the Pleiads.
οὐκ ἐπιτάξεις δούλῳ σου ἢ παιδίσκῃ, τοῖς ἐπὶ τὸν αὐτὸν θεὸν ἐλπίζουσιν, ἐν πικρίᾳ σου, μήποτε οὐ μὴ φοβηθήσονται τὸν ἐπ’ ἀμφοτέροις θεόν· οὐ γὰρ ἔρχεται κατὰ πρόσωπον καλέσαι, ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ οὓς τὸ πνεῦμα ἡτοίμασεν.	Do not enjoin anything in your bitterness upon your bondman or maidservant, who hope in the same God, lest ever they shall fear not God who is over both; for he comes not to call according to the outward appearance, but to them whom the Spirit has prepared.
ἔπινον δὲ τὴν ἄμυστιν μετὰ μέλους, μεμετρημένον πρὸς ὠκύτητα χρόνου.	And they also drank the ἄμυστις draught to an accompaniment of music the melody being measured out according to the quickness of the time
τὸ δὲ σύμπαν ἐξ ἐπιθυμίας ἡττῆσθαι διέφαινεν.	however, upon the whole, she seemed overcome with love to him.
Φῆστος οὖν ἐπιβὰς τῇ ἐπαρχείᾳ μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἀνέβη εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ἀπὸ Καισαρείας,	Now three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωδᾶε ἐπὶ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ Φαλτειά· καὶ υἱοὶ Δαυεὶδ οἱ πρῶτοι διάδοχοι τοῦ βασιλέως.	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the priests, and Phalteia and the descendants of David were the ⌊chief deputies⌋ of the king.
ὅτι τὸν τύραννον κτανέτην ἰσονόμους τ’ Ἀθήνας ἐποιησάτην.	You dared to set your country free, And gave her laws equality.
τῆς τ’ ἴβεως τὸν ὑποκλυσμὸν ἅλμῃ καθαιρομένης Αἰγύπτιοι συνιδεῖν καὶ μιμήσασθαι λέγουσιν·	The Egyptians declare that they have observed and imitated the ibis’ clyster-like purging of herself with brine
πρὸς τοῦ ποτ’ ἐν γῇ πτῶμα δύστηνον πίτνεις;	Who threw thee down thus pitiably?
ὡς ἀρχαῖος εἶ. Ζεὺς γάρ τις ἔστιν;	How antiquated you are! Why, is there any Jove?
σκόπει δ’ ὅτι σκνῖπες ἐν δένδρῳ καὶ τερηδόνες ἐμφύονται ξύλῳ κατὰ σῆψιν ὑγρότητος ἢ πέψιν·	Observe how worms and caterpillars are bred in trees from the moisture corrupted or concocted
Καὶ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ ἐσχίσθη εἰς δύο ἀπὸ ἄνωθεν ἕως κάτω.	Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν Ἐρικοῦσσα μὲν καὶ Φοινικοῦσσα ἀπὸ τῶν φυτῶν κέκληνται, ἀνεῖνται δὲ εἰς νομάς.	Of the others, [the fifth and sixth] are Ericus- sa and phnicussa they are called from the plants which they produce, and are given up to pasture.
ἀβλαβὲς οὐ φαντάζεσθε;	do you not imagine it to be free from harm?
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ὡς ἑάλω καὶ ἐσώθη, μάρτυρας ὑμῖν παρέξομαι, ἔπειθ’ ὅτι ἀφικόμενος τῆς οὐσίας παρὰ τῶν θείων τὸ μέρος μετέλαβεν, εἶθ’ ὅτι οὔτ’ ἐν τοῖς δημόταις οὔτ’ ἐν τοῖς φράτερσιν οὔτ’ ἄλλοθι οὐδαμοῦ τὸν ξενίζοντ’ οὐδεὶς πώποτ’ ᾐτιάσαθ’ ὡς εἴη ξένος.	In the first place, to prove that my father was taken prisoner and was ransomed, I will bring witnesses before you then, that when he reached home he received from his uncles his share of the property and furthermore, that neither among the members of the deme nor among those of the clan nor anywhere else did anyone ever accuse him (despite his foreign accent) with being a foreigner.
ἀλλὰ νὴ Δί’ ἴσως οὐχὶ πάντ’ αὐτῷ τοιαῦτα πέπρακται, οὐδὲ πανταχόθεν δῆλός ἐστι τεχνάζων.	But perhaps not all of his acts have been of this nature, nor is he proven in every instance to be a trickster.
Κνίδος μὲν γὰρ καὶ Ἁλικαρνασὸς οὐδ’ ἦν πω, Ῥόδος δ’ ἦν καὶ Κῶς, ἀλλ’ ᾠκεῖτο ὑφ’ Ἡρακλειδῶν.	For Cnidus and Halicarnasus were not then in existence. Rhodes and Cos existed, but were inhabited by Heracleid.
θώμεσθα δὴ τὰς κάλπιδας χἠμεῖς χαμᾶζ᾽, ὅπως ἂν ἢν προσφέρῃ τὴν χεῖρά τις μὴ τοῦτό μ᾽ ἐμποδίζῃ.	let us lay down the pitchers, so our bodies will be free, in case these lumping fellows try to cause some injury.
τοῖσι μὲν ἀνδράσι ταῦτα τὰ νοσήματα ἐπιχώριά ἐστι· καὶ χωρίς, ἤν τι πάγκοινον κατάσχῃ ἐκ μεταβολῆς τῶν ὡρέων·	The diseases I have mentioned are peculiar to the men, and besides they are liable to any common complaint which may be prevailing from the changes of the seasons.
καὶ περιθέμενοι σχῆμα ἀλλότριον περιπατεῖτε κλέπται καὶ λωποδύται τούτων τῶν οὐδὲν προσηκόντων ὀνομάτων καὶ πραγμάτων;	and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you, and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you?
λέγει δὲ οὕτως πεπωκέναι δοκεῖ τὸν κατὰ δύο καὶ τρεῖς ἀκράτου.	And he speaks thus,— I seem to have drunk two measures now of water, And only three of wine.
εἶναι δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ τάφον ἐν Μεγάροις.	Moreover, his tomb is in Megara.
εἴ τις ἀνέροιτο ἡμᾶς τὴν περὶ γράμματα συνουσίαν τῶν μανθανόντων, ὁπόταν τις ὁτιοῦν ὄνομα ἐρωτηθῇ τίνων ἐστὶ γραμμάτων, πότερον αὐτῷ τότε φῶμεν γίγνεσθαι τὴν ζήτησιν ἑνὸς ἕνεκα μᾶλλον τοῦ προβληθέντος ἢ τοῦ περὶ πάντα τὰ προβαλλόμενα γραμματικωτέρῳ γίγνεσθαι;	Suppose we were asked the following question about a group of pupils learning their letters When a pupil is asked of what letters some word or other composed, is the question asked for the sake of the one particular word before him or rather to make him more learned about all words in the lesson?
ὥστε καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν πολιτίδων σκοπεῖτε, τοῦ μὴ ἀνεκδότους γενέσθαι τὰς τῶν πενήτων θυγατέρας.	Take thought, therefore, also for the women who are citizens, that the daughters of poor men may not fail of marriage.

δεῖ οὖν πρῶτον ψυχῆς φύσεως πέρι θείας τε καὶ ἀνθρωπίνης ἰδόντα πάθη τε καὶ ἔργα τἀληθὲς νοῆσαι·	First, then, we must learn the truth about the soul divine and human by observing how it acts and is acted upon.
ἀλλὰ γὰρ ὅτε ἐγνώσθη τὸν βίον ἐκλιπὼν Ἀγρίππας, Καισαρεῖς καὶ Σεβαστηνοὶ τῶν εὐποιιῶν αὐτοῦ λαθόμενοι τὰ τῶν δυσμενεστάτων ἐποίησαν·	But when it was known that Agrippa was departed this life, the inhabitants of Cesarea and of Sebaste forgot the kindnesses he had bestowed on them, and acted the part of the bitterest enemies
καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ Μετὰ σοῦ ἐπιστρέφομεν εἰς τὸν λαόν σου.	But they said to her, “We are returning with you to your people.”
ἡ δὲ Ῥωξάνη κύουσα μὲν ἐτύγχανε καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τιμωμένη παρὰ τοῖς Μακεδόσι·	Now, Roxana was with child, and on this account was held in honour among the Macedonians

ὅτι ἠπειθήσατε τῷ ῥήματί μου ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὕδατος Ἀντιλογίας Καδὴς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σείν, διότι οὐχ ἡγιάσατέ με ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.	Because you both disobeyed my word among the children of Israel, on the water of controversy of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you both did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.
οὐ γὰρ δήπου Ὅμηρόν γε τὸν θειότατόν τε καὶ σοφώτατον ποιητὴν ἀγνοεῖν δοκεῖς ὡς οὐχ οἷόν τε ἦν ἐπίστασθαι κακῶς ἐκεῖνος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ λέγων τὸν Μαργίτην πολλὰ μὲν ἐπίστασθαι, κακῶς δέ, φησί, πάντα ἠπίστατο ἀλλ’ αἰνίττεται οἶμαι παράγων τὸ κακῶς μὲν ἀντὶ τοῦ κακοῦ, τὸ δὲ ἠπίστατο ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐπίστασθαι·	For surely you do not suppose that Homer, divinest and wisest of poets, did not know it was impossible to know ill for it is he who says of Margites that he knew many things, but knew them all ill but it is a riddle, I think, in which he has made ill stand for evil, and knew for to know.
ἐπίφθονος γὰρ ἡ προσποίησις τῆς τοιαύτης ἐπιστήμης, ὥστ’ εἰ μή τι θαυμαστὸν ὅσον διαφέρει τῇ ἀρετῇ τῶν ἄλλων, οὐκ ἔσθ’ ὅπως ἄν τις φύγοι τὸ καταγέλαστος γενέσθαι φάσκων ἔχειν ταύτην τὴν ἐπιστήμην.	for the pretension to such skill arouses jealousy, so that unless a man be prodigiously superior to the rest in valor he cannot by any means escape being made a laughing-stock through professing to be so skilled.
τοῦτο δ' ἡνίκα πρὸ τῆς ἀποστάσεως καὶ τοῦ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον κινήματος ἀθροιζομένου τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς τὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑορτήν, ὀγδόη δ' ἦν Ξανθικοῦ μηνός, κατὰ νυκτὸς ἐνάτην ὥραν τοσοῦτο φῶς περιέλαμψε τὸν βωμὸν καὶ τὸν ναόν, ὡς δοκεῖν ἡμέραν εἶναι λαμπράν, καὶ τοῦτο παρέτεινεν ἐφ' ἡμίσειαν ὥραν:	Also, before the revolt and the troubles preceding the war, when the people flocked to the feast of Azymes, on the eighth day of the month Xanthicus, at the ninth hour of the night, such a great light shone round the altar and the sanctuary, that it appeared to be bright daylight, and lasted for half an hour.
ἀλλ’ ὅρα τὸ τῆς παραινέσεως, εἰ μὴ μόνον ἔχει δεξιῶς; πρὸς ἀγορὰν ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς συμπόσιον·	But consider whether this advice may not be accommodated to an entertainment as well as the Forum
τύραννόν τε γὰρ ἢ βασιλέα ἐγκωμιαζόμενον, ἕνα τῶν νομέων, οἷον συβώτην ἢ ποιμένα ἤ τινα βουκόλον, ἡγεῖται ἀκούειν εὐδαιμονιζόμενον πολὺ βδάλλοντα·	When he hears a panegyric of a despot or a king he fancies he is listening to the praises of some herdsman—a swineherd, a shepherd, or a neatherd, for instance—who gets much milk from his beasts
ἔπαυσαν δ’ αὐτοὺς Ῥωμαῖοι τῆς τοιαύτης ἐπιτηδεύσεως.	Hereupon the Romans put a stop to this occupation [piracy].
τοὺς λέγοντας μὲν τὰ σπουδαῖα, μὴ ποιοῦντας δέ, ἔλεγε μηδὲν διαφέρειν κιθάρας·	Those who say admirable things, but fail to do them, he compared to a harp
προσποιουμένη δὲ θαυμάζειν τοῖς φίλοις διηγεῖτο, καὶ παρεκάλει τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ γενέσθαι θεατάς.	But the Egyptian saw through the trick, and pretending to admire her lover’s skill, told her friends about it, and invited them to be spectators of it on the following day.
τίς δ’ οὖσα καὶ τίνος ὄντος ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ σώματος προτέρα καὶ πρεσβυτέρα λέγεται γεγονέναι, προϊὼν ὁ λόγος ἐνδείξεται τοῦτο γὰρ ἠγνοημένον ἔοικε τὴν πλείστην ἀπορίαν καὶ ἀπιστίαν παρέχειν τῆς ἀληθοῦς δόξης.	But what the soul is, what the body, and why the soul is said to have been elder than the body, shall be made appear in the progress of this discourse. The ignorance of this seems to have been the occasion of much doubt and incredulity in reference to the true opinion.
ἔστω ὦν λιβανωτοῦ τῆς μάννης, καὶ πολίου τῆς κόμης, καὶ Ῥητίνης ἀπὸ τερμίνθου καὶ πίτυος τῶν δενδρέων, καὶ ἀλθαίης Ῥίζης, καὶ πηγάνου καὶ κονύζης τῆς βοτάνης.	Let the application consist of the manna of frankincense, and of the hair of poley, and of the resins of turpentine and pine-trees, and of the root of marsh-mallow and of rue, and of the herb fleabane.
οὐδὲ γὰρ δίκην ἔτι λαμβάνειν ἐθέλετε παρὰ τῶν ἀδικούντων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦτ’ ἐξελήλυθεν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως.	You are no longer willing to bring malefactors to justice retribution has disappeared from our city.

Λυσιμάχου δὲ τέλος ἐπιβαλόντος ἠφανίσθη.	but when Lysimachus became ruler there, and put a tax on it, that lake, too, disappeared
Καθὼς καὶ ἐν ἑτέρῳ λέγει, Σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδέκ.	As He also says in another place: "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek";
ἀτίμων ὅσοι ἄτιμοι ἦσαν πρὶν ἢ Σόλωνα ἄρξαι, ἐπιτίμους εἶναι πλὴν ὅσοι ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου ἢ ὅσοι ἐκ τῶν ἐφετῶν ἢ ἐκ πρυτανείου καταδικασθέντες ὑπὸ τῶν βασιλέων ἐπὶ φόνῳ ἢ σφαγαῖσιν ἢ ἐπὶ τυραννίδι ἔφευγον ὅτε ὁ θεσμὸς ἐφάνη ὅδε.	As many of the disfranchised as were made such before the archonship of Solon, shall be restored to their rights and franchises, except such as were condemned by the Areiopagus, or by the ephetai, or in the prytaneium by the kings, on charges of murder or homicide, or of seeking to establish a tyranny, and were in exile when this law was published.
τόδ’ ἤδη δόλιον ἔς με μηχανᾷ.	You are contriving this as a trick against me.
βοτάνη τε ὑψηλὴ πᾶσα καὶ λάχανον * νεαρὸν καὶ δρακόντιον, οἱ δὲ τῶν σταφυλίνων καυλοὶ καὶ ἱππομαράθου καὶ σκολύμων δωδεκαπήχεις, τὸ δὲ πάχος παλαιστῶν τεττάρων·	All plants and pot-herbs are tall, as the arum and dracontium the stalks of the staphylinus, the hippomarathum, and the scolymus are twelve cubits in height, and four palms in thickness.

οἶος γὰρ ἐρύετο Ἴλιον Ἕκτωρ.	for only Hector guarded Ilios.
κοινωνίας δὲ καὶ συνόδους καὶ θεῶν τιμὰς ἀποδοὺς ἑκάστῳ γένει πρεπούσας, τότε πρῶτον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἀνεῖλε τὸ λέγεσθαι καὶ νομίζεσθαι τοὺς μὲν Σαβίνους, τοὺς δὲ Ῥωμαίους, καὶ τοὺς μὲν Τατίου, τοὺς δὲ Ῥωμύλου πολίτας, ὥστε τὴν διαίρεσιν εὐαρμοστίαν καὶ ἀνάμιξιν πάντων γενέσθαι πρὸς πάντας.	He also appointed social gatherings and public assemblies and rites of worship befitting each body. And thus, at last, he banished from the city the practice of speaking and thinking of some citizens as Sabines, and of others as Romans or of some as subjects of Tatius, and others of Romulus, so that his division resulted in a harmonious blending of them all together.
πρὸς μὲν γὰρ τὸν πόλεμον πολλαὶ πόλεις ἂν εὑρεθεῖεν καλῶς ἠγωνισμέναι, περὶ δὲ στάσεως οὐκ ἔστιν ἣν ἄν τις ἐπιδείξειεν ἄμεινον τῆς ἡμετέρας βεβουλευμένην.

διὸ καὶ καθόλου μὲν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἀποδεχόμενοι καὶ τιμῶντες τὸν ἄνδρα, περὶ τοὺς ἐσχάτους καιροὺς καὶ τὰς προειρημένας πράξεις εὐδοκούμενοι κατὰ πάντα τρόπον ταῖς μεγίσταις τιμαῖς ἐτίμησαν αὐτὸν κατὰ πόλεις καὶ ζῶντα καὶ μεταλλάξαντα.

ὅμως δὲ ὑπόμνησόν με σμικρόν.	However, please refresh my memory a little
ἐπεὶ μάντιν γε τὰ σημεῖα μόνον δεῖ γιγνώσκειν τῶν ἐσομένων, εἴτε τῳ θάνατος εἴτε νόσος εἴτε ἀποβολὴ χρημάτων ἔσται, εἴτε νίκη εἴτε ἧττα ἢ πολέμου ἢ καὶ ἄλλης τινὸς ἀγωνίας·	for the seer’s business is to judge only the signs of what is yet to come—whether a man is to meet with death or disease or loss of property, or victory or defeat in war or some other contest
Ἐγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ σὺ ἐν ἐμοί, ἵνα ὦσιν τετελειωμένοι εἰς ἕν, καὶ ἵνα γινώσκῃ ὁ κόσμος ὅτι σύ με ἀπέστειλας, καὶ ἠγάπησας αὐτούς, καθὼς ἐμὲ ἠγάπησας.	"I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.
ἐάν τε γάρ τις μέγας οὕτως οἴηται εἶναι ὥστε κύπτειν τὰς πύλας τοῦ τείχους διεξιών, ἐάν τε οὕτως ἰσχυρὸς ὥστ’ ἐπιχειρεῖν οἰκίας αἴρεσθαι ἢ ἄλλῳ τῳ ἐπιθέσθαι τῶν πᾶσι δήλων ὅτι ἀδύνατά ἐστι, τοῦτον μαίνεσθαι φάσκειν, τοὺς δὲ μικρὸν διαμαρτάνοντας οὐ δοκεῖν τοῖς πολλοῖς μαίνεσθαι, ἀλλ’, ὥσπερ τὴν ἰσχυρὰν ἐπιθυμίαν ἔρωτα καλοῦσιν, οὕτω καὶ τὴν μεγάλην παράνοιαν μανίαν αὐτοὺς καλεῖν.	For instance, if a man imagines himself to be so tall as to stoop when he goes through the gateways in the Wall, or so strong as to try to lift houses or to perform any other feat that everybody knows to be impossible, they say he’s mad. They don’t think a slight error implies madness, but just as they call strong desire love, so they name a great delusion madness.
ἐν δὲ Πονήρᾳ πάλιν ὁ Ἄλεξις · καὶ χόνδρος ἔνδον ἐστὶ Θετταλικὸς πολύς.	And, again, Alexis says, in his play called The Wicked Woman— There's a large parcel of Thessalian groats.

τριῶν ὄντων τριτταὶ καὶ ἡδοναί μοι φαίνονται, ἑνὸς ἑκάστου μία ἰδία· ἐπιθυμίαι τε ὡσαύτως καὶ ἀρχαί.	The three parts have also, it appears to me, three kinds of pleasure, one peculiar to each, and similarly three appetites and controls.
πεπαύμεθ’ ἡμεῖς, οὐχ ὅπως σὲ παύσομεν.	It is we who are stopped we cannot stop you.
Ὅταν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ βασιλεὺς, ἀρχαιρεσίας παρὰ τὸν ποταμὸν τελοῦσι· καὶ ὃς ἂν εὑρεθῆ τὸν λίθον ἐκεῖνον ἔχων, παραχρῆμα βασιλεὺς γίνεται, καὶ τὰ σκῆπτρα παραλαμβάνει τοῦ τελευτήσαντος, καθὼς ἱστορεῖ Κτησιφῶν ἐν γ΄ περὶ Φυτῶν·	Whoever finds the stone when the king dies, and has it ready against the time that the people meet upon the banks of the river to choose a new sovereign, is presently elected king, and receives the sceptre of the deceased prince as Ctesiphon relates in his Third Book of Plants

οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἄρατον, οὔτε κατιδόντες καλῶς τὸ γινόμενον οὔτ’ ἐκλογισάμενοι δεόντως τὸ μετὰ ταῦτα συμβησόμενον, ἅμα τῷ τοὺς ἱππεῖς ἰδεῖν ὑποχωροῦντας ἐλπίσαντες αὐτοὺς φεύγειν, τοὺς μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν κεράτων θωρακίτας ἐξαπέστειλαν, παραγγείλαντες βοηθεῖν καὶ συνάπτειν τοῖς παρ’ αὑτῶν εὐζώνοις, αὐτοὶ δ’ ἐπὶ κέρας κλίναντες τὴν δύναμιν ἦγον μετὰ δρόμου καὶ σπουδῆς.	But Aratus, having an imperfect view of what was going on, and making a bad conjecture of what would happen next, no sooner saw the cavalry retiring, than, hoping that they were in absolute flight, he sent forward the heavy-armed troops of his two wings, with orders to join and support the advanced guard of their light-armed troops while he himself, with his remaining forces, executed a flank movement, and led his men on at the double.

εὔψυχοι μὲν οὖν ἔσονται, ἐὰν μὴ λείπωσι τὰ κυνηγέσια ὅταν ᾖ πνίγη· εὔρινες δέ, ἐὰν τοῦ λαγῶ ὀσφραίνωνται ἐν τόποις ψιλοῖς, ξηροῖς, προσηλίοις τοῦ ἄστρου ἐπιόντος·	They will be plucky if they don’t leave the hunting-ground when the heat is oppressive keen-nosed if they smell the hare on bare, parched and sunny ground in the dog days
προσδοκᾶν δὲ παρ’ αὐτοῦ μὴ διαλλαγὴν μόνον, τοῦτο γὰρ ἤδη γέγονεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ στρατηγίαν, ἣν αὐτῷ καὶ Ἀψάλωμος παρέσχε.	that he might expect from him not only a reconciliation, for that was already granted, but that supreme command of the army also which Absalom had bestowed upon him.

He did this to find out about his father and what had happened after his own departure, and wanting to know what had become of his brother Benjamin, for he feared that they had dared to rid the family of him, as they had done to him.

ἑνὶ γὰρ λόγῳ κοινῷ τοὺς θεοὺς τούτους περὶ πᾶσαν ἀγαθοῦ μοῖραν ἡγούμεθα τετάχθαι· καὶ πᾶν ὅσον ἔνεστι τῇ φύσει καλὸν καὶ ἀγαθὸν διὰ τούτους ὑπάρχειν, τὸν μὲν διδόντα τὰς ἀρχάς, τὴν δ’ ὑποδεχομένην καὶ διανέμουσαν.	For we hold that these Gods are set over the whole share of good in common, and that whatever is either good or amiable in Nature is all owing to these, the one yielding the principles, and the other receiving and dispensing them.

καὶ βραχέα διαλεχθεὶς ὁ Φίλιππος ἠξίου πάντας, μάλιστα δὲ τὸν Τίτον, μὴ διακόψαι τὴν διάλυσιν, τῶν γε δὴ πλείστων εἰς συμβατικὴν διάθεσιν ἠγμένων, ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν ἐνδέχεται δι’ αὑτῶν συμφώνους γενέσθαι περὶ τῶν ἀντιλεγομένων·	Philip in a short speech called on all, and especially on Flamininus, "Not to break off the negotiation for peace now that by far the greater number were inclined to come to some arrangement but, if possible, to come to an understanding by themselves on the points in dispute

Not only is he lost to shame when money is in question, but he is so dull-witted that he cannot see that crowns are a symbol of merit, but saucers and the like only of wealth that every crown, however small, implies the same regard for honor as if it were large that drinking-cups and censers and such possessions, if very numerous, attach to their owners a sort of reputation for wealth but, if a man takes pride in trifles, instead of winning some honor by them, he is disdained as a man of vulgar tastes.
τῷ γε βιάζεσθαι τοῖς λόγοις ὁμολογεῖν αὐτὸν μὴ λέγειν ὀρθῶς·	And it was by forcing him by our arguments to acknowledge that what he says is wrong.
πέμψαντος δὲ τοῦ νεανίσκου ῥαβδοῦχον καὶ καταβῆναι κελεύσαντος, οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι διετράπησαν, αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Φάβιος ἀποπηδήσας τοῦ ἵππου προσέδραμε παρ’ ἡλικίαν καὶ περιβαλὼν τὸν υἱόν, εὖγε, εἶπεν, ὦ παῖ, φρονεῖς, αἰσθόμενος τίνων ἄρχεις καὶ πηλίκης ἀρχῆς μέγεθος παρείληφας.	The young man sent a sergeant to command him to alight when others were at a stand, Fabius presently alighted, and running faster than for his age might be expected, embraced his son. Well done, son, said he, I see you are wise, and know whom you govern, and the grandeur of the office you have undertaken.

ὄντος δὲ τοῦ Γναΐου πρὸς τὸ πολισμάτιον τὸ καλούμενον Γορδίειον, ἧκον παρ’ Ἐποσογνάτου πρέσβεις ἀποδηλοῦντες ὅτι πορευθεὶς διαλεχθείη τοῖς τῶν Γαλατῶν βασιλεῦσιν, οἱ δ’ ἁπλῶς εἰς οὐδὲν συγκαταβαίνοιεν φιλάνθρωπον, ἀλλ’ ἡθροικότες ὁμοῦ τέκνα καὶ γυναῖκας καὶ τὴν ἄλλην κτῆσιν ἅπασαν εἰς τὸ καλούμενον ὄρος Ὄλυμπον ἕτοιμοι πρὸς μάχην εἰσίν.	. When Cnaeus was at the small town of Gordieium, ambassadors came from Eposognatus, announcing that he had been round and talked with the kings of the Gauls, but that they would not consent to make any overtures of friendship whatever on the contrary, they had collected their children and women on Mount Olympus, and were prepared to give battle. .

οἱ μὲν γὰρ περὶ τε τοὺς εὐεργέτας τῆς Ἑλλάδος καὶ τοὺς συγγενεῖς τοὺς αὑτῶν τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἐξαμαρτάνειν ἐτόλμησαν, οἱ δ’ ἡμέτεροι Μεσσηνίων μὲν τοὺς διασωθέντας εἰς Ναύπακτον κατῴκισαν, Πλαταιέων δὲ τοὺς περιγενομένους πολίτας ἐποιήσαντο καὶ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτοῖς ἁπάντων μετέδοσαν.	for, while the Lacedaemonians did not scruple to commit such wrongs both against the benefactors of Hellas and against their own kinsmen, our ancestors, on the other hand, gave the surviving Messenians a home in Naupactus and adopted the Plataeans who had escaped with their lives as Athenian citizens and shared with them all the privileges which they themselves enjoyed.

ἐδεῖτο οὖν ἡμῶν δοῦναι χάριν ταύτην αὑτῷ, ἐκδοῦναι ἄλλῳ αὐτὴν μετὰ τῆς γνώμης τῆς ἑαυτοῦ. καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐκελεύομεν αὐτὸν πείθειν αὐτὴν περὶ τούτων· ὅ τι γὰρ 〈ἂν〉 ἐκείνη πεισθῇ, τοῦτ’ ἔφαμεν ποιήσειν.

At the same time, with the rest of his Athenians, he engaged the Megarians on land, and while the fight was still raging the crew of the ship succeeded in capturing the city.
διόπερ Ἥρα καὶ Ζεὺς ἀμφισβητοῦντες πότερον τὰς γυναῖκας ἢ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἥδεσθαι μᾶλλον ἐν ταῖς συνουσίαις συμβαίνοι, τοῦτον ἀνέκριναν.	Hence, when Hera and Zeus disputed whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision.

They feared other gods.
καθὼς γέγραπται, Ἰδοὺ τίθημι ἐν Σιὼν λίθον προσκόμματος καὶ πέτραν σκανδάλου· καὶ πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων ἐπ' αὐτῷ οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται.	As it is written: "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, And whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."
οὐ γάρ που ὅταν γε ἀδύνατον ᾖ τῶν ἁπάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι, τότε ἀμέλεια ἔσται τῶν σμικρῶν ἢ μεγάλων, μὴ ἐπιμελουμένῳ ὧν ἂν δυνάμει θεὸς ἢ φαῦλός τις ὢν ἐλλιπὴς καὶ μὴ δυνατὸς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι γίγνηται.	For when it is impossible to care for all things, it will not in that case be neglect of great things or small when a person—be he god or common man—fails to care for things which he lacks the power and capacity to care for.
Μακεδόνων δὲ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ἐς ἀλλήλους στασιασάντων, Ἀντίγονος μὲν ἦρχε Συρίας Λαομέδοντα ἐκβαλών, Μιθριδάτης δ’ αὐτῷ συνῆν, ἀνὴρ γένους βασιλείου Περσικοῦ.	Not long afterward dissensions broke out among the Macedonians. Antigonus expelled Laomedon from Syria and assumed the government himself. He had with him one Mithridates, a scion of the royal house of Persia.
τούτων μὲν δὴ τὸν εἰργασμένον εἴργει.	Accordingly the law excludes the murderer from all these places
καὶ αὐτὸν εὐθὺς τῆς ἐπιούσης ὁ Ἀπουλήιος ἐπιπέμψας τὸν ὑπηρέτην ἐξεῖλκεν ἀπὸ τοῦ βουλευτηρίου.	Saturninus proceeded against him at once on the next day. He sent an officer for him and dragged him out of the senate-house.
παρὰ δὲ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κηφισοῦ Μεδούσης λίθου πεποιημένη κεφαλή· Κυκλώπων φασὶν εἶναι καὶ τοῦτο ἔργον.	Beside the sanctuary of Cephisus is a head of Medusa made of stone, which is said to be another of the works of the Cyclopes.
Εἰ καθὼς ὁ κεραμεὺς οὗτος οὐ δυνήσομαι τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὑμᾶς, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ; ἰδοὺ ὡς ὁ πηλὸς τοῦ κεραμέως ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ ἐν χερσίν μου.	“Shall I not be able to do with you just as this potter, O house of Israel? Look, in my hands you are like the clay is to the potter.
χρῆται δὲ αὐταῖς καὶ παλλακίσιν ὁ βασιλεὺς . διὰ τῆς τῶν μηλοφόρων αὐλῆς.	And very often the king takes pleasure with them in the hall of the Melophori.
τὴν δ’ ὑπερκειμένην ἐν βάθει χώραν τῆς σύρτεως καὶ τῆς Κυρηναίας κατέχουσιν οἱ Λίβυες, παράλυπρον καὶ αὐχμηράν·	The country deep in the interior, and above the Syrtis and Cyrena, a very sterile and dry tract, is in the possession of Libyans.
ἀλλά μοι δοκεῖ οὕτω μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνως.	I think what you suggest is more likely than the other way.
̔υπέρκειται δὲ τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ τῆς κοίλης Συρίας μέχρι Βαβυλωνίας καὶ τῆς τοῦ Εὐφράτου ποταμίας πρὸς νότον Ἀραβία πᾶσα χωρὶς τῶν ἐν τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ σκηνιτῶν.	ABOVE Juda and Cle-Syria, as far as Babylonia and the river tract, along the banks of the Euphrates towards the south, lies the whole of Arabia, except the Scenit in Mesopotamia.
τά τε περὶ τῶν Φρυγῶν καὶ τῶν Μυσῶν λεγόμενα πρεσβύτερα τῶν Τρωικῶν ἐστιν·	The accounts respecting the Phrygians and the Mysians are more ancient than the Trojan times.
καὶ ἄλλα γε αὖ στρατηγόν, οἷον Ἆγις καὶ Πολέμαρχος καὶ Εὐπόλεμος.	Others again mean general, such as Agis (leader), Polemarchus (war-lord), and Eupolemus (good warrior)
ἐμπειρία μὲν γὰρ ποιεῖ τὸν αἰῶνα ἡμῶν πορεύεσθαι κατὰ τέχνην, ἀπειρία δὲ κατὰ τύχην.	for experience conducts the course of our life according to art, but inexperience according to chance.
ἐπράθησαν δ’ οὖν ἁλόντες ὀλίγῳ πεντακισχιλίων ἐλάττους, οἱ δὲ μείναντες ἐν τῇ πολιτείᾳ καὶ κριθέντες Ἀθηναῖοι μύριοι καὶ τετρακισχίλιοι καὶ τεσσαράκοντα τὸ πλῆθος ἐξητάσθησαν.	As a result, a little less than five thousand were convicted and sold into slavery, and those who retained their citizenship and were adjudged to be Athenians were found, as a result of this scrutiny, to be fourteen thousand and forty in number.
οἷον, διὰ τί τῶν ὑπὸ φθίσεως ἢ ὑδέρου διαφθαρέντων τοὺς παῖδας εἰς ὕδωρ τὼ πόδε βρέχοντας καθίζεσθαι κελεύομεν, ἕως ἂν ὁ νεκρὸς κατακαῇ;	For example, what certain reason can be given for that custom amongst us, of ordering the children of parents that die of a consumption or a dropsy to sit with both their feet soaking in the water till the dead body be burnt?
τοιαῦτα δὲ ὅσα ταχὺ ἀναλίσκεται, οἷον τὰ ἐδώδιμα, ἢ τὰ εὐμετάβλητα σχήμασιν ἢ χρώμασιν ἢ κράσεσιν, ἢ ἃ πολλαχοῦ ἀφανίσαι εὔπορον· τοιαῦτα δὲ τὰ εὐβάστακτα καὶ ἐν μικροῖς τόποις ἀφανιζόμενα.	such are things that are quickly consumed, as eatables things which can easily be changed in form or color or composition things for which there are many convenient hiding-places, such as those that are easy to carry or stow away in a corner
οὗτοι δὲ δὴ τίνες εἰσίν;	and who are these? these are the mystic celebrants.
Καὶ πάντα προφήτην λαλοῦντα ἐν πνεύματι οὐ πειράσετε οὐδὲ διακρινεῖτε· πᾶσα γὰρ ἁμαρτία ἀφεθήσεται, αὕτη δὲ ἡ ἁμαρτία οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται.	And every prophet who speaks with the spirit, you will not test or judge, for every sin will be forgiven.
καὶ ὡσαύτως πάχος καὶ λεπτότητα ἢ μαλακότητα καὶ σκληρότητα ἡ ἁφή;	and similarly of the relation of touch, to thickness and thinness, softness and hardness?
Ἴδε τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου καὶ ἐξελοῦ με, ὅτι τὸν νόμον σου οὐκ ἐπελαθόμην.	See my humiliation, and deliver me, because I did not forget your law.
Ἀριστείδης δὲ καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ὥσπερ ὁδὸν ἰδίαν ἐβάδιζε διὰ τῆς πολιτείας, πρῶτον μὲν οὐ βουλόμενος συναδικεῖν τοῖς ἑταίροις ἢ λυπηρὸς εἶναι μὴ χαριζόμενος, ἔπειτα τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν φίλων δύναμιν οὐκ ὀλίγους ἰδὼν ἐπαίρουσαν ἀδικεῖν ἐφυλάττετο, μόνῳ τῷ χρηστὰ καὶ δίκαια πράττειν καὶ λέγειν ἀξιῶν θαρρεῖν τὸν ἀγαθὸν πολίτην.	But Aristides walked the way of statesmanship by himself, on a private path of his own, as it were, because, in the first place, he was unwilling to join with any comrades in wrong-doing, or to vex them by withholding favours and, in the second place, he saw that power derived from friends incited many to do wrong, and so was on his guard against it, deeming it right that the good citizen should base his confidence only on serviceable and just conduct.
ἐπεὶ γὰρ τἀνδρὸς τεθνηκότος αἰχμάλωτος ἤγετο, τὰ ἀφιδρύματα τῶν θεῶν, ἅπερ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καὶ αὐτῇ πατρῷα ἦν, ἐπιχώριον δὲ τοῖς ἐκείνῃ πᾶσίν ἐστιν ἐπί τε τῆς οἰκίας ἔχειν σεβάσματα καὶ ἰοῦσιν ἐπὶ ξένης συνεπάγεσθαι, περιστέλλουσα καὶ ταύτῃ τοῦ πατρίου τὸ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς ἔθος συναπήγετο, καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον λεληθότως αὐτῶν θρησκείαν ἐποιεῖτο, γαμετὴ δὲ ἀποδειχθεῖσα ἤδη τρόπῳ τῷ αὐτῆς εἰωθότι καὶ μεθ’ οἵων νομίμων ἐπὶ τοῦ προτέρου ἀνδρὸς ἐθεράπευεν αὐτούς.	Since she was led away captive, upon the death of her husband, she concealed the images of those gods which were their country gods, common to her husband and to herself now it was the custom of that country for all to have the idols they worship in their own houses, and to carry them along with them when they go into a foreign land agreeable to which custom of theirs she carried her idols with her. Now at first she performed her worship to them privately
μόνοι πάντων ἀναπεισθέντες ὑπο “τινων βασκάνων ἀνθρώπων τὸν καθ’ ἡμὰς ἐν διαβολῇ “καταστῆσαι λόγον ἠθέλησαν Νέρων καὶ Δομετιανὸς, “ἀφ’ ὧν καὶ τὸ τῆς συκοφαντίας ἀλόγῳ συνηθείᾳ “περὶ τοὺς τοιούτους ῥυῆναι συμβέβηκε ψεῦδος.	About the schism at Rome under BlastuS. XVL The tradition concerning Montanus and those who were false prophets together with him.
καὶ ὁ μὲν ἐπέτρεψεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ δήμαρχοι περὶ τῆς ἐπιστασίας ἠξίουν ἀνακληροῦσθαι· Ῥουβρίου γὰρ τοῦ λαχόντος ἐκστάντος αὖθις ἐς ἅπαντας τὴν διακλήρωσιν περιιέναι.	This he did, but the remaining tribunes contended that the presidency should be decided by lot, saying that when Rubrius, who had been chosen in that way, resigned, the casting of lots ought to be done over again for all.
Ἄρα οὖν ζῶντος τοῦ ἀνδρὸς μοιχαλὶς χρηματίσει, ἐὰν γένηται ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ· ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἀνήρ, ἐλευθέρα ἐστὶν ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου, τοῦ μὴ εἶναι αὐτὴν μοιχαλίδα, γενομένην ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ.	So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man.
Ξενοφῶν δὲ ἔτι μὲν ἐπεχείρησεν ἀπαλλαγεὶς τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐκπλεῦσαι·	For a time, indeed, Xenophon did try to get clear of the army and sail away home
εἶδον δὲ καὶ ἄλλον Τρίτωνα ἐν τοῖς Ῥωμαίων θαύμασι, μεγέθει τοῦ παρὰ Ταναγραίοις ἀποδέοντα.	I saw another Triton among the curiosities at Rome, less in size than the one at Tanagra.
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν αὐτῷ διαλλαχθήσομαι ἑκών·	i ask for nothing better than to be reconciled with him
ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ἐπὶ Φάρον τὴν νῆσον ἄλλοι στάδιοι πεντήκοντα πρὸς τοῖς ἑκατόν.	Thence to the island Pharos are 150 stadia more.
ἡσθεὶς οὖν τῇ θέᾳ καὶ τῆς προφάσεως ἐπιβαίνων ἄσμενος, ἑτέρας αὐτῶν ἑκάστῳ πεντακοσίας δραχμὰς ἐπεδίδου καί, εἴ τις πολέμου χρεία γένοιτο, νικήσασιν ἐπηγγέλλετο πεντακισχιλίας.	Octavius was delighted with the spectacle and was pleased to make this a pretext for distributing 500 drachmas more to each man, and he promised that in case of war he would give them 5000 drachmas each if they were victorious.
ἐλέγξωμεν ἀλλήλους·	Let us confute each other.
Τὴν Καλαύρειαν Εἰρήνην τὸ παλαιὸν ὠνόμαζον ἀπὸ γυναικὸς Εἰρήνης, ἣν ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος καὶ Μελανθείας τῆς Ἀλφειοῦ γενέσθαι μυθολογοῦσιν.	Solution. Of old they called Calauria Irene from a woman Irene, which they fable to be the daughter of Neptune and Melanthea, the daughter of Alpheus.
τούτων δὲ οὐδὲν ἔγγραφον ὁ Κρατερὸς τεκμήριον παρέσχηκεν, οὔτε δίκην οὔτε ψήφισμα, καίπερ εἰωθὼς ἐπιεικῶς γράφειν τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ παρατίθεσθαι τοὺς ἱστοροῦντας.	But Craterus furnishes no documentary proof of this,—no judgment of the court, no degree of indictment,—although he is wont to record such things with all due fullness, and to adduce his authorities.
ἀλλὰ τὴν ἐπὶ Πύλαις μάχην;	and another says, No, but about the battle of Thermopylae.
λέγεται δὲ καὶ φωνή τις αὐτοῦ περιφερομένη πρότερον, εἰπόντος ὡς τὸ ἴσον πόλεμον οὐ ποιεῖ, καὶ τοῖς κτηματικοῖς ἀρέσκειν καὶ τοῖς ἀκτήμοσι, τῶν μὲν ἀξίᾳ καὶ ἀρετῇ, τῶν δὲ μέτρῳ καὶ ἀριθμῷ τὸ ἴσον ἕξειν προσδοκώντων·	It is also said that a certain utterance of his which was current before his election, to the effect that equality bred no war, pleased both the men of substance and those who had none the former expecting to have equality based on worth and excellence, the latter on measure and count.
Ὅπερ δὲ τοῖς μεγάλοις συμβαίνει στρατοπέδοις καὶ μάλιστα παρὰ τὰς κακοπραγίας δυσάρκτοις εἶναι καὶ δυσπειθέσι, τοῦτο καὶ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις συνέπεσεν·	THAT which is usually the case of great armies, and especially upon ill success, to be hard to be pleased, and governed with difficulty, did now befall the Jews
ἕτερος τὸ μὴ τεθυκέναι μηδὲ θύσειν ποτὲ διετείνετο.	Another stoutly maintained that he not sacrificed, and never would.
οὐ γὰρ ἡ τροφὴ μόνον πόρρωθεν ἐκομίζετο καὶ σὺν μεγάλῃ ταλαιπωρίᾳ τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦτο τεταγμένων Ἰουδαίων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ ποτὸν ἦν ἀγώγιμον [εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον] τοῦ τόπου μηδεμίαν ἐγγὺς πηγὴν ἀναδιδόντος.	or not only had food to be brought from a great distance, at the cost of much labour to the Jews assigned to it, but water too had to be brought to the camp, because the place had no springs near it.
τούς τε οὖν ἀλωμένους ἐκ τῆς ἐκείνου στρατιᾶς ἡγεμόνας ἢ στρατιώτας ἐφιλανθρωπεύετο, καὶ τοῖς ἰδίοις ἐγκατέλεγεν ἢ τοὺς ἐθέλοντας αὐτῶν ἐς τὸν Ἀντώνιον ἔπεμπεν, ὡς οὐ δι’ ἔχθρας ἀνηκέστου πρὸς αὐτὸν ἰόντα·	Accordingly, he began to make friends of those of Antony's army who had been taken prisoners, both officers and soldiers. He enrolled them among his own troops, or if they wished to return to Antony he allowed them to do so, in order to show that he was not moved by implacable hatred against him.
ἤδη δέ τινες σμικρὰ χόρτου διαμασώμενοι σπαράγματα, καί τινας ἀνέδην φθοροποιοὺς ἐσθίοντες πόας, τὴν τῶν σωμάτων ἔξιν λυ μαινόμενοι διώλλυντο.	and others again injured their bodily health, and died from chewing small wisps of hay and recklessly eating certain pernicious herbs.
Καὶ ποιμένες ἦσαν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῇ αὐτῇ ἀγραυλοῦντες καὶ φυλάσσοντες φυλακὰς τῆς νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ποίμνην αὐτῶν.	Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night.
Φιλόνεικοι ἔστε, ἀδελφοί, καὶ ζηλωταὶ περὶ τῶν ἀνηκόντων εἰς σωτηρίαν.	You are contentious, brethren, and zealous for the things which lead to salvation.
ὁμοίως δὲ τοῦτο καὶ περὶ τὰς ἄλλας ἐμπειρίας καὶ τέχνας.	and that this is the case similarly with regard to the other arts and crafts.
Πομπήϊος δέ, πεντακισχιλίοις μόνοις καὶ τριακοσίοις μίαν Καίσαρος πόλιν Ἰταλικὴν καταλαβόντος, ἐξέπεσε τῆς Ῥώμης ὑπὸ δέους, ἢ τοσούτοις εἴξας ἀγεννῶς ἢ πλείονας ψευδῶς εἰκάσας·	but Pompey, after Caesar had occupied a single city of Italy with only fifty-three hundred men, hurried away from Rome in a panic, either yielding ignobly to so few, or conjecturing falsely that there were more
τὴν τοῦ λέγοντος ὅτι πάντα οἶδε καὶ ταῦτα ἕτερον ἂν διδάξειεν ὀλίγου καὶ ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ, μῶν οὐ παιδιὰν νομιστέον;	And when a man says that he knows all things and can teach them to another for a small price in a little time, must we not consider that a joke?
ἀπέδικες ἀπέταμές τ’:	Off thou hast thrown him, off hast cut The man from the city
πρῶτόν τε ἦρξε καὶ ἐς τἆλλα τῇ πόλει ἐπὶ πλέον ἀνομίας τὸ νόσημα.	And the great licentiousness, which also in other kinds was used in the city, began at first from this disease.
ἃ δὴ διανοουμένους ἡμᾶς, ὦ Κλεινία, σοὶ δεῖ τὴν πόλιν καινὴν οὖσαν πάντῃ συνδεῖν, μήτε μέγα μήτε σμικρὸν παραλιπόντας εἰς δύναμιν ὅσα νόμους ἢ ἔθη τις ἢ ἐπιτηδεύματα καλεῖ·	Bearing this in mind, Clinias, we must clamp together this State of yours, which is a new one, by every possible means, omitting nothing great or small in the way of laws, customs and institutions
εἰρήκει δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς περὶ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ· ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ἔδοξαν ὅτι περὶ τῆς κοιμήσεως τοῦ ὕπνου λέγει.¶	(Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.)
λαβὼν μέντοι παρ’ αὐτῶν τὸν ἀντάραντα τῷ βασιλεῖ πρὸς τιμωρίαν Σαβαῖον υἱὸν δὲ Βοχορίου παύσεσθαι τῆς πολιορκίας καὶ τὴν στρατιὰν ἀπάξειν.	and if they will deliver me up Sheba, the son of Bichri, who hath rebelled against the king, I will leave off the siege, and withdraw the army from the place."
ὅταν γὰρ εἴπῃ· δύο δὲ πελειάδες ἀμφὶς ἕκαστον χρύσειαι νεμέθοντο, πελειάδας οὐ σημαίνει τὰς ὄρνιθας, ἅς τινες ὑπονοοῦσι περιστερὰς εἶναι, ἁμαρτάνοντες.	For when he says δύο δὲ πελειάδες were placed in gold around each handle, he does not mean the birds called πελειάδες, that is to say, turtle-doves and those who think that he does use πελειάδες here as synonymous with περιστεραὶ are wrong.
ὡς δὲ αὐτοὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι λέγουσι, Λέλεξ αὐτόχθων ὢν ἐβασίλευσε πρῶτος ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ καὶ ἀπὸ τούτου Λέλεγες ὧν ἦρχεν ὠνομάσθησαν.	According to the tradition of the Lacedaemonians themselves, Lelex, an aboriginal was the first king in this land, after whom his subjects were named Leleges.
ὡς οὖν καινοτομοῦντός σου περὶ τὰ θεῖα γέγραπται ταύτην τὴν γραφήν, καὶ ὡς διαβαλῶν δὴ ἔρχεται εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον, εἰδὼς ὅτι εὐδιάβολα τὰ τοιαῦτα πρὸς τοὺς πολλούς.	So he has brought the indictment against you for making innovations in religion, and he is going into court to slander you, knowing that slanders on such subjects are readily accepted by the people.
ἀλλ᾽ ἄλφιτ᾽ ἤδη σοι ποριῶ ᾽ σκευασμένα.	well then! you shall have flour - cakes all piping hot.
ὁ δ’ ἐλεήσας ἀπημπόλησε· προσσχούσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς Σαλαμῖνι, Τελαμὼν ὠνήσατο ἡ δ’ ἔτεκεν Αἴαντα· ὡς Ἀρητάδης Κνίδιος ἐν δευτέρῳ *=.	But the soldier, in compassion to the woman, rather sold her, and she was carried away by sea to the island of Salamis, where Telamon bought her, and had by her Ajax.—Aretades Cnidius, in his Second Book of Islands.
ἐκ τῆς εἰκόνος μανθάνειν αὐτήν τε αὐτὴν εἰ καλῶς εἴκασται, καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἧς ἦν εἰκών, ἢ ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας αὐτήν τε αὐτὴν καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτῆς εἰ πρεπόντως εἴργασται;	To learn from the image whether it is itself a good imitation and also to learn the truth which it imitates, or to learn from the truth both the truth itself and whether the image is properly made?
Εὐφραῖος μὲν γὰρ παρὰ Περδίκκᾳ τῷ βασιλεῖ διατρίβων ἐν Μακεδονίᾳ οὐχ ἧττον αὐτοῦ φαῦλος ὢν καὶ διάβολος οὕτω ψυχρῶς συνέταξε τὴν ἑταιρίαν τοῦ βασιλέως ὥστε οὐκ ἐξῆν τοῦ συσσιτίου μετασχεῖν, εἰ μή τις ἐπίσταιτο γεωμετρεῖν ἢ φιλοσοφεῖν.	For Euphræus, when he was sojourning with king Perdiccas in Macedonia, was not less a king than the other, being a man of a depraved and calumnious disposition, who managed all the companionship of the king in so cold a manner, that no one was allowed to partake of his entertainments unless he knew something about geometry or philosophy
ὁ Βαρῖνος λίαν αὐστηρὸς καὶ ἀεὶ ἑαυτοῦ κρείττων γίνεται.	The Barbine is very dry and continually improving.
ἢ ταύταν νῦν ἔκνιψαι ἢ μὴ ἔσο.	aither clear yersel’ of this or stop yer living.
Ἀλλ' οὐδ' ὑπὲρ τοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ παρ' αὐτοῖς ἀφανισθῆναι συγγράμματα τὴν τυχοῦσαν ὑποστήσεται βλάβην·	They would rather let all their writings be destroyed than suffer any harm,
τὰς γὰρ ἀποῤῥεούσας ἀτόμους ἀπὸ τῶν λίθων ταῖς ἀποῤῥεούσαις ἀπὸ τοῦ σιδήρου τοῖς σχήμασιν οἰκείας εἶναί φησιν, ὥστε περιπλέκεσθαι ῥᾳδίως.	His view is that the atoms which flow from the stone are related in shape to those flowing from the iron, and so they become easily interlocked with one another
Θερσάνδρου δὲ τοῦ Πολυνείκους καὶ Ἀργείων ἑλόντων Θήβας ἄλλοι τε αἰχμάλωτοι καὶ ἡ Μαντὼ τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι ἐκομίσθησαν ἐς Δελφούς·	When Thebes was taken by Thersander, the son of Polyneices, and the Argives, among the prisoners brought to Apollo at Delphi was Manto.
λογισάμενοι δὴ συννοήσωμεν τὸ πάθος ἐκ τῶν νῦν λεχθέντων, ὃ πάντων ἔφαμεν εἶναι τῶν θαυμαστῶν αἴτιον.	Then, in the light of what has been said, let us consider and gain understanding of the event which we said was the cause of all those wonderful portents
ἀλλ᾽ ἔστι κομιδῇ τρὺξ παλαιὰ καὶ σαπρά.	but these lees are quite rancid and fusty.
ἄμαχον γὰρ τὸ ἐνδελεχές, ᾧ πᾶσαν ἐπιὼν ὁ χρόνος αἱρεῖ καὶ κατεργάζεται δύναμιν, εὐμενὴς ὢν σύμμαχος τοῖς δεχομένοις λογισμῷ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτοῦ, τοῖς δὲ ἀκαίρως ἐπειγομένοις πολεμιώτατος.	For irresistible is the force of continuity, by virtue of which advancing Time subdues and captures every power and Time is a kindly ally for all who act as diligent attendants upon opportunity, but a most bitter enemy for all who urge matters on unseasonably.
ἐμοὶ δὲ σοῦ πράσσοντος εὐτυχῶς, πάτερ, οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδὲν κτῆμα τιμιώτερον, τί γὰρ πατρὸς θάλλοντος εὐκλείας τέκνοις ἄγαλμα μεῖζον, ἢ τί πρὸς παίδων πατρί;	For me, father, no treasure is more precious than your prosperity. What, indeed, is a nobler ornament for children than the fair fame of a thriving father, or for a father than that of his children?
καὶ μὴν τοιοῦτόν γε ὂν οὐδαμοῦ ἂν εἴη· οὔτε γὰρ ἐν ἄλλῳ οὔτε ἐν ἑαυτῷ εἴη.	Moreover, being of such a nature, it cannot be anywhere, for it could not be either in anything else or in itself.
ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου· ἐδούλευσά σοι δέκα καὶ τέσσερα ἔτη ἀντὶ τῶν δύο θυγατέρων σου καὶ ἓξ ἔτη ἐν τοῖς προβάτοις σου, καὶ παρελογίσω ⸆ τὸν μισθόν μου δέκα ἀμνάσιν.	These twenty years of mine I am in your house; I served you ⌊fourteen⌋ years for your two daughters and six years among your sheep, and you defrauded my wages by ten ewe lambs.
ἀφικόμενος οὖν ὁ Λύσανδρος εἰς Λακεδαίμονα καὶ πορευθείς, ὥσπερ ἔθος ἐστίν, εἰς τὸ ἀρχεῖον, ἀπέδωκε τοῖς ἐφόροις τὰ γράμματα τοῦ Φαρναβάζου, πεπεισμένος ἀνῃρῆσθαι τὸ μέγιστον αὐτοῦ τῶν ἐγκλημάτων·	Accordingly, when Lysander arrived at Sparta and went, as the custom is, into the senate-house, he gave the ephors the letter of Pharnabazus, convinced that the greatest of the complaints against him was thus removed
πρὸς ἡμῶν κάππεσε, κάτθανε, καὶ καταθάψομεν, οὐχ ὑπὸ κλαυθμῶν τῶν ἐξ οἴκων, ἀλλ’ Ἰφιγένειά νιν ἀσπασίως θυγάτηρ, ὡς χρή, πατέρ’ ἀντιάσασα πρὸς ὠκύπορον πόρθμευμ’ ἀχέων περὶ χεῖρε βαλοῦσα φιλήσει.	By our hands down he fell, down to death, and down below shall we bury him—but not with wailings from his household. No! Iphigenia, his daughter, as is due, shall meet her father lovingly at the swift-flowing ford of sorrows, and shall fling her arms around him and kiss him.
ὁ δὲ καὶ διὰ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν καὶ διὰ τὸν ὅρκον ἐξέστη καὶ παρέδωκε τῇ Πολυκρίτῃ τὸν τόπον, ἐκείνη δὲ τοῖς πολίταις.	He, because of his love and his oath, was carried quite away, and handed over the spot to Polycrite, and she in turn to the citizens.
ὅτι μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ Θαψάκου ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα τοσοῦτόν ἐστιν, εἴρηκεν ἐκεῖνος· ὅτι δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ δι’ ἑκατέρου παραλλήλου ἐπὶ τὸν διὰ θατέρου, οὐκ εἴρηκεν· οὐδὲ γάρ, ὅτι ἐπὶ ταὐτοῦ μεσημβρινοῦ ἐστιν ἡ Θάψακος καὶ ἡ Βαβυλών.	He says, indeed, that such is the distance from Thapsacus to Babylon, but not that there is this distance between their parallels, nor yet that Thapsacus and Babylon are under the same meridian.
λέγεται δὲ ὁ Σερτώριος οὔτε ὑφ’ ἡδονῆς οὔτε ὑπὸ δέους εὐάλωτος γενέσθαι, φύσει δὲ ἀνέκπληκτος ὢν παρὰ τὰ δεινά καὶ μέτριος εὐτυχίαν ἐνεγκεῖν·	And it is said that Sertorius was no easy victim either of pleasure or of fear, but that he was naturally unterrified in the face of danger, and bore prosperity with moderation
ἡ δὲ πνοὴ ἰοῦσα στεγανῶς ἐς τὸν λέβητα, ἔχοντα ἄνθρακάς τε ἡμμένους καὶ θεῖον καὶ πίσσαν, φλόγα ἐποίει μεγάλην καὶ ἧψε τοῦ τείχους, ὥστε μηδένα ἔτι ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ μεῖναι, ἀλλὰ ἀπολιπόντας ἐς φυγὴν καταστῆναι καὶ τὸ τείχισμα τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἁλῶναι.	The blast passing closely confined into the cauldron, which was filled with lighted coals, sulphur and pitch, made a great blaze, and set fire to the wall, which soon became untenable for its defenders, who left it and fled and in this way the fort was taken.
σὺ δὲ καὶ ὅμηρα τῆς ἀδείας, οἰκεῖα αὐτοῦ σοῦ, τοῖς ἀνδροφόνοις ἔπεμψας ἐς τὸ Καπιτώλιον.	But you sent hostages from your own family to the murderers at the Capitol for their security.
ὁπόσα δ’ ἂν ἁλίσκηται ἀξιώσω αὐτὸς ἔχειν, ἵνα ταῦτα διατιθέμενος ὑμῖν τὸν μισθὸν πορίζω.	but whatever may be captured I shall expect to retain for myself, so that by selling it I may provide you your pay.
Ἰωάννης μὲν οὖν οὕτω καταστρατηγηθεὶς ὑπ᾽ ἐμοῦ τὸ λοιπὸν ἐν τῇ πατρίδι περίφοβος ἔμεινεν.	and outmanoeuvred by me, from then on John was afraid and stayed in his own town.
Κράντωρ Σολεὺς θαυμαζόμενος ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ πατρίδι ἀπῆρεν εἰς Ἀθήνας καὶ Ξενοκράτους διήκουσε Πολέμωνι συσχολάζων.	Crantor of Soli, though he was much esteemed in his native country, left it for Athens and attended the lectures of Xenocrates at the same time as Polemo.
περιάγου, κεῖσε, πρὸς τἀριστερά.	They are getting round thee on the left.
τί δῆτα πρὸς σὲ καὶ γέροντ’ ἦλθεν φόβος;	Why has panic fallen on you and my aged father?
τὸν μὲν οὖν νεκρὸν ἔρριψαν ὑπὲρ τὸ τεῖχος, τὸν δὲ Βάττον προαγαγόντες ἀνέδειξαν ἐπὶ τοῖς πατρίοις βασιλέα, καὶ τὴν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς πολιτείαν ὁ Πολύαρχος ἀπέδωκε τοῖς Κυρηναίοις.	the corpse immediately they threw over the wall. Battus they brought forth and proclaimed king over his father’s dominions, and Polyarchus restored to the Cyrenaeans their ancient constitution of government.
ὅτι αὐτὸν ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ἐκ πασῶν τῶν φυλῶν σου, παρεστάναι ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ, λειτουργεῖν καὶ εὐλογεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.	For the Lord chose him from all your tribes to stand before the Lord God to minister and bless in his name, he and his sons among the children of Israel.
ἔφη γὰρ ἐν Χαλκίδι παρά τῳ ξένῳ δειπνῶν θαυμάζειν τό τῶν κρεῶν πλῆθος· εἰπεῖν δὲ τόν ξένον ὅτι ταῦτα πάντα χοίρειά ἐστιν ἡδύσμασι καὶ σκευασίαις διαφέροντα.	Once I dined with a friend at Chalcis, and when I wondered at the variety of dishes, said my host, All these are pork, only in dressing and sauces they differ.
μᾶλλον δὲ χρὴ προσδέχεσθαι τοῦ μὲν αἵματος τὴν Ῥῆξιν τοῖσι νεωτέροισι πέντε καὶ τριήκοντα ἐτέων, τοῖσι δὲ γεραιτέροισι τὴν ἐκπύησιν.	but the hemorrhage is rather to be looked for in persons younger than thirty years, and the suppuration in more elderly persons.
ὁκόταν γὰρ ὑγρότερος τῆς φύσιος ἔῃ, ἀνάγκη κινέεσθαι, κινευμένου δὲ μήτε τὴν ὄψιν ἀτρεμίζειν μήτε τὴν ἀκοὴν, ἀλλ’ ἄλλοτε ἄλλο ὁρᾷν καὶ ἀκούειν, τήν τε γλῶσσαν τοιαῦτα διαλέγεσθαι οἷα ἂν βλέπῃ τε καὶ ἀκούῃ ἑκάστοτε·	For when it is more moist than natural, it is necessarily put into motion, and the affection being moved, neither the sight nor hearing can be at rest, and the tongue speaks in accordance with the sight and hearing.
καὶ ὁ μὲν Σφοδρίας ταῦτ’ ἔπραττεν.	Sphodrias, then, set about doing this.
ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι Σπαρτιάτην λέγουσιν εἶναι τὸν ἀποκτείναντα Ἐπαμινώνδαν, τίθενται δὲ Μαχαιρίωνα ὄνομα καὶ οὗτοι τῷ ἀνδρί.	The Lacedaemonians on their part say that a Spartan killed Epaminondas, but they too give Machaerion as the name of the man.
τοῖς δέ που παισὶν εὐθύς τε καὶ ὅσον ἂν χρόνον μήπω εἰς πόλεμον ἴωσιν, πᾶσι θεοῖς προσόδους τε καὶ πομπὰς ποιουμένους μεθ’ ὅπλων τε καὶ ἵππων ἀεὶ κοσμεῖσθαι δέον ἂν εἴη, θάττους τε καὶ βραδυτέρας ἐν ὀρχήσεσι καὶ ἐν πορείᾳ τὰς ἱκετείας ποιουμένους πρὸς θεούς τε καὶ θεῶν παῖδας.	It shall be the rule for the children, from the age of six until they reach military age, whenever they approach any god and form processions, to be always equipped with arms and horses, and with dance and march, now quick, now slow, to make their supplications to the gods and the children of gods.
οὐχ ἵν’ εὐεργέτημά τι καταλογίσηται πρὸς ὑμᾶς γελοῖον γὰρ ἂν εἴη τοῦτο τὸ εὐεργέτημα, ἀλλ’ ἵν’ ἐνδείξηται ἅπασι τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ὅτι Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ ἐν τῇ θαλάττῃ χωρία ἀγαπῶσι παρὰ τοῦ Μακεδόνος λαμβάνοντες.	It is not that he wants to debit you with a benefaction received, for such a benefaction would be a farce but that he wants all Greece to take notice that the Athenians are content to receive maritime strongholds from the man of Macedon.
οὐκοῦν καὶ οἱ νόμιμοι νόμῳ νόμιμοι;	And so the law-abiding are law-abiding by law?
ἆρ’ οὖν πρὸς Διός, ὥσπερ αἱ ἄλλαι τέχναι ἐπιδεδώκασι καὶ εἰσὶ παρὰ τοὺς νῦν δημιουργοὺς οἱ παλαιοὶ φαῦλοι, οὕτω καὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν τὴν τῶν σοφιστῶν τέχνην ἐπιδεδωκέναι φῶμεν καὶ εἶναι τῶν ἀρχαίων τοὺς περὶ τὴν σοφίαν φαύλους πρὸς ὑμᾶς;	Then for Heaven’s sake, just as the other arts have progressed, and the ancients are of no account in comparison with the artisans of today, shall we say that your art also has progressed and those of the ancients who were concerned with wisdom are of no account in comparison with you?
εἰ δέ, καθάπερ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις πόλεσι, καὶ παρ’ ἐκείνοις ἔσται τὰ τοιαῦτα, τίς ὁ τρόπος ἔσται τῆς κοινωνίας;	But if the family life and property of the Farmers are to be such as they are in other states, what sort of communism will there be?
πρακτὰ γὰρ τὰ καθ’ ἕκαστα.	for action has to do with particular things.
ἓν ἄρα εἰ μὴ ἔστι, τἆλλα οὔτε ἔστιν οὔτε δοξάζεται ἓν οὐδὲ πολλά.	Then if one does not exist, the others neither are nor are conceived to be either one or many.
ἀμφότεροι δὴ ὅθεν οὐ δεῖ κερδαίνειν βουλόμενοι αἰσχροκερδεῖς·	hence both are guilty of sordid greed, trying as they do to get gain from wrong sources.
καὶ νυκτός, οἱ μὲν ὅπλα ἔχοντες οἱ δὲ γυμνοί, σανίδας φέροντες ἐπετίθεσαν τῇ κατὰ σφᾶς τάφρῳ τοῦ Μανιλίου, καὶ τὸ χαράκωμα διέσπων.	They made a sally by night, some with arms, others, unarmed, carrying planks with which to bridge the ditch of the Roman camp, and began to tear down the palisades.
πενία ἄνδρα ταπεινοῖ, χεῖρες δὲ ἀνδρείων πλουτίζουσιν. [1] υἱὸς πεπαιδευμένος σοφὸς ἔσται, τῷ δὲ ἄφρονι διακόνῳ χρήσεται.	Poverty makes a man humble, but the hands of the diligent enrich.
εἰσὶν γὰρ πνεύματα δαιμονίων ποιοῦντα σημεῖα ἃ ἐκπορεύεται ἐπὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς τῆς οἰκουμένης ὅλης συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς μεγάλης τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ παντοκράτορος.	For they are the spirits of the demons performing signs who go out to the kings of the earth to bring them together for the battle that will take place on the great day of God, the All-Powerful.
διὰ μὲν γὰρ τῆς ἄρκτου καὶ τῆς ἁμάξης τὸν ἀρκτικὸν δηλοῖ·	Now, by the Bear and the Wain, he means the Arctic Circle

καίτοι τοῦτο παθεῖν αὐτὴν ἐξαπατηθεῖσαν λέγουσιν, ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀμουλίου διαπαρθενευθεῖσαν, ἐν ὅπλοις ἐπιφανέντος αὐτῇ καὶ συναρπάσαντος.	And yet it is said that she was deceived into doing this, and was really deflowered by Amulius himself, who came to her in armour and ravished her.
αἱ μὲν οὖν πόλεις οὐκέτ’ εἰσί, τὸ δὲ τῆς Ὕβλης ὄνομα συμμένει διὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν τοῦ Ὑβλαίου μέλιτος.	These cities no longer exist, but the name of Hybla survives on account of the Hyblan honey.

ὃ δὲ κατ’ ἀρχάς τε ἐλέγομεν, καὶ νῦν αὑτὸς πάρεστι λόγος ἀληθὴς ὄντως, ὡς οὐ δυνατὸν ἀνθρώποις τελέως μακαρίοις τε καὶ εὐδαίμοσι γενέσθαι πλὴν ὀλίγων, ἔστιν ταῦτα ὀρθῶς εἰρημένα·	And what we said at the beginning, and stands now also unchanged as a really true statement, that it is not possible for men to be completely blessed and happy, except a few, has been correctly spoken.
τοὐράνου γάρ μοι μέτεστι· καὶ γὰρ ἄνδρας ἐσφέρω, τοῖς δὲ δυστήνοις γέρουσιν οὐ μέτεσθ᾽ ὑμῖν, ἐπεὶ τὸν ἔρανον τὸν λεγόμενον παππῷον ἐκ τῶν Μηδικῶν εἶτ᾽ ἀναλώσαντες οὐκ ἀντεσφέρετε τὰς ἐσφοράς, ἀλλ᾽ ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν διαλυθῆναι προσέτι κινδυνεύομεν.	for i' m taxed too, and as a toll provide men for the nation while, miserable greybeards, you, it is true, contribute nothing of any importance whatever to our needs; but the treasure raised against the medes you've squandered, and do nothing in return, save that you make our lives and persons hazardous by some imbecile mistakes what can you answer? now be careful, don't arouse my spite, or with my slipper i'll take you napping, faces slapping left and right

καὶ παρ’ ἀκόντων ἔδωκ’ ἄφεσιν τοῖς τὰ ὑμέτερ’ ἀξιοῦσιν ἔχειν βίᾳ, καὶ μόνον οὐ προσέγραψε δίκην ἐξεῖναι λαχεῖν αὐτῷ κατὰ τῶν δικαστῶν τῶν προστιμησάντων τοῦ δεσμοῦ.

οἱ δὲ στρατιῶται τὸ μὲν πρῶτον οὐκ ἤθελον ἀκούειν, ἀλλ’ ἀποκτείνειν ἐβόων τοὺς τὸν δῆμον καταλύοντας, ἔπειτα μέντοι μόλις ἡσυχάσαντες ἤκουσαν.	The soldiers at first would not hear them, and cried out to put to death the subverters of the democracy, but at last, after some difficulty, calmed down and gave them a hearing.
ὁ δὲ ὑπέσχετο τοῦτο ποιήσειν, ἂν μὴ πορευόμενος Ὀρφεὺς ἐπιστραφῇ πρὶν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὑτοῦ παραγενέσθαι·	The god promised to do so, if on the way Orpheus would not turn round until he should be come to his own house.
ἰὼ ἰώ, νῦν αὖ, νῦν, ὦ Ζεῦ, πάρα λευκὸν εὐάμερον πελάσαι φάος θοᾶν ὠκυάλων νεῶν, ὅτ’ Αἴας λαθίπονος πάλιν, θεῶν δ’ αὖ πάνθυτα θέσμι’ ἐξήνυσ’ εὐνομίᾳ σέβων μεγίστᾳ.	Joy, joy! Now, Zeus, now can the white radiance of prosperous days approach our swift, sea-speeding ships, since Ajax forgets his pain anew, and has instead fully performed all prescribed sacrifices to the gods with worship and strict observance.
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄν με φλαῦρον ἐργάσαισθ’ ἔτι, οἷος ἐμοὶ τρέφεται τοῖσδ’ ἐνὶ δώμασι παῖς, ἀμφήκει γλώττῃ λάμπων, πρόβολος ἐμός, σωτὴρ δόμοις, ἐχθροῖς βλάβη, λυσανίας πατρῴων μεγάλων κακῶν·	For you can no longer do me any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his father.
ζῶσι γὰρ ἀκολάστως πρὸς ἅπασαν ἀκολασίαν καὶ τρυφερῶς.	for they live dissolutely in respect of every sort of dissoluteness, and luxuriously.
ἀνειμένου γὰρ τοῦ στόματος ἐκπνεῖσθαι τὸ θερμὸν ἐξ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν, ὅταν δὲ συστρέψαντες τὰ χείλη φυσήσωμεν, οὐ τὸν ἐξ ἡμῶν ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀέρα τὸν πρὸ τοῦ στόματος ὠθεῖσθαι ψυχρὸν ὄντα καὶ προσεμπίπτειν.	when the mouth is slack, what is exhaled is warm air from our own bodies but when we compress the lips and blow, it is not air from ourselves, but the cold air in front of the mouth that is propelled forward and makes contact.
κλύων γὰρ ὧν σύ μοι λέγεις λόγων ἀνεπτέρωμαι.	why, as I listen to you, I am beside myself with delight.
Ἀντίπατρος γὰρ ἱκανός ἐστι νήφων.	for it is quite sufficient if Antipater is sober.
Ναξίοις δὲ ἀποστᾶσι μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπολέμησαν καὶ πολιορκίᾳ παρεστήσαντο, πρώτη τε αὕτη πόλις ξυμμαχὶς παρὰ τὸ καθεστηκὸς ἐδουλώθη, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὡς ἑκάστῃ ξυνέβη.	After this Naxos left the confederacy, and a war ensued, and she had to return after a siege this was the first instance of the engagement being broken by the subjugation of an allied city, a precedent which was followed by that of the rest in the order which circumstances prescribed.
λάβεσθε κεἰς ἕδραν μ’ ἐρείσατε αὐτοῦ πέπλοισι τοῖσδε κρύψαντες, τέκνα.	take hold and support me to a seat hard by, when ye have drawn my mantle o’er my face, my sons.
ἀλλ’ ἐδέδεικτο ὅτι ἕτερον σημαίνει.	but it has been proved above that they have different meanings.
εἰ γλυκὺς χυμὸς ἐὼν μεταβάλλοι ἐς ἄλλο εἶδος, μὴ ἀπὸ συγκρήσιος, ἀλλὰ αὐτὸς ἐξιστάμενος, ποῖός τις ἂν πρῶτος γένοιτο, πικρὸς ἢ ἁλμυρὸς ἢ στρυφνὸς ἢ ὀξύς;	If a humour that is sweet assumes another form, not by admixture, but by a self-caused change, what will it first become, bitter, or salt, or astringent, or acid?
μειρακίου γοῦν τὸν πίθον αὐτοῦ συντρίψαντος, τῷ μὲν πληγὰς ἔδοσαν, ἐκείνῳ δὲ ἄλλον παρέσχον.	At all events, when a youngster broke up his tub, they gave the boy a flogging and presented Diogenes with another.
τοῦτον δεύτερον θρίαμβον ἐθριάμβευσε λαμπρότερον τοῦ προτέρου Φάβιος, ὥσπερ ἀθλητὴς ἀγαθὸς ἐπαγωνιζόμενος τῷ Ἀννίβᾳ καί ῥᾳδίως ἀπολυόμενος αὐτοῦ τὰς πράξεις, ὥσπερ ἅμματα καί λαβὰς οὐκέτι τὸν αὐτὸν ἐχούσας τόνον.	For this success, Fabius celebrated a second triumph more splendid than his first, since he was contending with Hannibal like a clever athlete, and easily baffling all his undertakings, now that his hugs and grips no longer had their old time vigour.
’ καὶ ὁ Θέων εὖγ’ εἶπεν ὦ παῖ, καὶ καλῶς·	Well done, my young friend, said Theon, and excellently said.
ἀλλὰ τοῦ γε Μαρκίου πολλὰς ὑποφαίνοντος ὠτειλὰς ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἀγώνων, ἐν οἷς ἐπρώτευσεν ἑπτακαίδεκα ἔτη συνεχῶς στρατευόμενος, ἐδυσωποῦντο τὴν ἀρετὴν, καὶ λόγον ἀλλήλοις ἐδίδοσαν ὡς ἐκεῖνον ἀποδείξοντες.	So when Marcius disclosed his many scars from many contests, wherein he had been a foremost soldier for seventeen years together, the people were put out of countenance by his valour, and agreed with one another to elect him.
Διὸ μνημονεύετε ὅτι ὑμεῖς ποτὲ τὰ ἔθνη ἐν σαρκί, οἱ λεγόμενοι ἀκροβυστία ὑπὸ τῆς λεγομένης περιτομῆς ἐν σαρκὶ χειροποιήτου,	Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh -- who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands --
οἱ δὲ ἀμελήσαντες ἀπῆλθον, ὃς μὲν εἰς τὸν ἴδιον ἀγρόν, ὃς δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμπορίαν αὐτοῦ·	But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.
τά τε ἱερὰ νοσεύματα καλεύμενα, ὀλίγα μὲν ταῦτα, ἰσχυρὰ δέ.	Instances of the disease called "sacred" are rare but violent.
τοῦ δ’ ἠθικοῦ ἥ τε Ἀπολογία καὶ ὁ Κρίτων καὶ Φαίδων καὶ Φαῖδρος καὶ τὸ Συμπόσιον Μενέξενός τε καὶ Κλειτοφῶν καὶ Ἐπιστολαὶ καὶ Φίληβος Ἵππαρχος Ἀντερασταί· τοῦ δὲ πολιτικοῦ ἥ τε Πολιτεία καὶ οἱ Νόμοι καὶ ὁ Μίνως καὶ Ἐπινομὶς καὶ ὁ Ἀτλαντικός·	Physics is represented by the Timaeus, logic by the Statesman, Cratylus, Parmenides and Sophist, ethics by the Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus and Symposium, as well as by the Menexenus, Clitophon, the Epistles, Philebus, Hipparchus and the Rivals, and lastly politics by the Republic, the Laws, Minos, Epinomis, and the dialogue concerning Atlantis.
τὰ γὰρ αὔτ’ ἔπαθεν ἄν.	for it would have met with the same fate.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ καὶ οὕτως ἐχόντων τολμῶσιν ἀμφισβητεῖν, καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν τῶν νόμων ἀκριβέστερον διδάξομεν.	Since, however, even though this is so, they have the impudence to dispute my right, we will explain the point in greater detail from the actual laws.
τὸ δέ μοι δεδομένον ὑπὸ σφῷν ἴτω, καὶ διεξέλθωμεν πάντως τοὺς νόμους.	So let your joint admission stand at that, and let us by all means proceed with our laws.
ἑώρων γὰρ αὐτὸν οὐ πλοῦτον, οὐ δόξαν, οὐ φιλίαν βασιλικήν, οὐ τὸ τῆς αὑτοῦ πατρίδος συμφέρον, οὐκ ἄλλο τι τῆς αὐξήσεως τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ἐπίπροσθεν ποιούμενον.	For they saw that he put first and foremost, not wealth, not fame, not friendship with kings, not his own native city’s advantage, but only the growth in power of the Achaean League.
καὶ τὸ μὲν δὴ μεγέθει δώρων ὑπερβάλλειν πλουσιώτατον ὄντα οὐ θαυμαστόν·	That he, the richest man of all, should excel in the munificence of his presents is not surprising
ἢν δὲ ὁ ἀσθενέων ἰσχνὸς καὶ λείφαιμος ἔῃ, μὴ τάμνειν φλέβα.	But if the patient be thin, and scantily supplied with blood, we must not open a vein.
τῶν δὲ φρουρῶν οἱ μὲν ἀπέθανον, διακόσιοι δὲ ἐλήφθησαν·	Of the defendants, some were slain and two hundred taken prisoners
Καὶ ταῦτα λέγοντος αὐτοῦ, κατῃσχύνοντο πάντες οἱ ἀντικείμενοι αὐτῷ· καὶ πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ἔχαιρεν ἐπὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐνδόξοις τοῖς γινομένοις ὑπ' αὐτοῦ.	And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
οὐκ ἄδηλον δ’ ὅτι τῇ μὲν δόσει ἕπεται τὸ εὖ ποιεῖν καὶ τὸ καλὰ πράττειν, τῇ δὲ λήψει τὸ εὖ πάσχειν ἢ μὴ αἰσχροπραγεῖν.	but manifestly doing good and acting nobly go with giving, while having good done to one and avoiding base actions go with getting.
καὶ τὰ παιδία ἥκεις ἔχων εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον, καὶ ἀναβιβάσας αὐτίκα δὴ ἀξιώσεις ὑπὸ τούτων ἐλεεῖσθαι;	Have you brought your children with you into court, Philippides? Are you going to bring them soon on to the platform and so claim pity from the jury?
οἱ δ’ ἐπιθυμίᾳ κέρδους προσλαβόντες ἡγεμονικὴν παρακέλευσιν οὐ μόνον ἐφ’ ὃν ἐπέμφθησαν τόπον ἥρπαζον, ἀλλ’ εἰς πάσας ἐμπηδῶντες τὰς οἰκίας ἔσφαζον τοὺς οἰκήτορας.	So the soldiers, taking this exhortation of their commander in a sense agreeable to their desire of gain, did not only plunder the place they were sent to, but forcing themselves into every house, they slew its inhabitants
καὶ εἶπεν Δαυεὶδ πρὸς τὸν θεόν Ἡμάρτηκα σφόδρα ὅτι ἐποίησα τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο· καὶ νῦν περίελε δὴ τὴν κακίαν παιδός σου, ὅτι ἐματαιώθην σφόδρα.	David said to God, “I have sinned miserably because I did this thing. So now please take away the badness of your servant, because I have acted very foolishly.”
ἐν τούτῳ δὴ τῷ χρόνῳ ἐν ᾧ μήπω κέκτηται τὴν οἰκείαν φρόνησιν, πᾶν μαίνεταί τε καὶ βοᾷ ἀτάκτως, καὶ ὅταν ἀκταινώσῃ ἑαυτὸ τάχιστα, ἀτάκτως αὖ πηδᾷ.	consequently, every creature, during the period when it is still lacking in its proper intelligence, continues all in a frenzy, crying out wildly, and, as soon as it can get on its feet, leaping wildly.
εἰ δ’ ἕτερόν τι ἐρεῖ, πλείω τὰ στοιχεῖα ἐρεῖ·	And if he speaks of some other component, he will be maintaining too many elements
μάλιστα δὲ τὰς ἀπὸ κρεῶν φοβητέον ἀπεψίας· καὶ γὰρ εὐθὺς σφόδρα καὶ βαρύνουσι, καὶ λείψανον εἰσαῦθις πονηρὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν παραμένει.	But ill digestion is chiefly to be feared after flesh, for it presently very much clogs us and leaves ill relics behind it.
εἶτα 〈τί〉 παρελθόντες τὸν τελευταῖον τοῦ οἴκου γεγενημένον κληρονόμον τοῦ Πύρρου κλήρου τὴν λῆξιν λαχεῖν ἠξίωσαν παρὰ τὸν νόμον.	And, secondly, why did they think fit to claim the succession to Pyrrhus's estate illegally, ignoring him who was its last tenant?
Εἰ δέ τις ἀγνοεῖ, ἀγνοείτω.	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
οὕτω δ’ ἦσαν διάπονοι τὰ σώματα καὶ κατηθληκότες ὡς μήτε ἱδροῦντά τινα μήτε ἀσθμαίνοντα Ῥωμαίων ὀφθῆναι διὰ πνίγους τοσούτου καὶ μετὰ δρόμου τῆς συρράξεως γενομένης, ὡς τὸν Κάτλον αὐτὸν ἱστορεῖν λέγουσι μεγαλύνοντα τοὺς στρατιώτας.	And their bodies were so inured to toil and so thoroughly trained that not a Roman was observed to sweat or pant, in spite of the great heat and the run with which they came to the encounter. This is what Catulus himself is said to have written in extolling his soldiers.
τό γε μὴν ὁμοίως προσέχειν ταῖς δόξαις καὶ ταῖς φαντασίαις τῶν πρὸς αὑτοὺς διαμφισβητούντων εὔηθες·	and further they are limits of these same things.
Ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς, Εἶπον ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι· εἰ οὖν ἐμὲ ζητεῖτε, ἄφετε τούτους ὑπάγειν·	Jesus answered, "I have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way,"
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Μωυσῆς κατασκέψασθαι τὴν Ἰαζήρ, καὶ κατελάβοντο αὐτὴν καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξέβαλον τὸν Ἀμορραῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐκεῖ.	And Moses sent to scout out Jazer, and they seized it and its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were dwelling there.
ἐναργὴς γὰρ ἐπὶ τούτων ἡ πρόρρησις ἣν εἶπεν ὁ θεός ‘ἀποδιδοὺς ἁμαρτίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα ἕως τρίτης καὶ τετάρτης γενεᾶς τοῖς μισοῦσί με. ’ τὰς γὰρ ἰδίας πονηρὰς ἐπιθυμίας, ὧν ηὐτύχει, ταῖς τῶν υἱῶν κεφαλαῖς ἐπιβαλὼν, εἰς ἐκείνους ‟τὴν ἑαυτοῦ κακίαν καὶ τὸ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν μῖσος ‟ἐξωμόρξατο.	For in them was clearly fulfilled the prophecy that God spake ῾Visiting the rins of fathers upon children, until the third and fourth generation in them that hate me.᾿ For his own evil desires, in vhieh he failed, he heaped upon the heads of his sons, and so wiped off on them his own wickedness and his hatred toward God."
καὶ εἰ μὴ ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῇ πρὸς Λικίννιον Κράσσον παρατάξει, οὐ τὸν τυχόντα ἂν ἱδρῶτα τοῖς ἡμεδαποῖς παρεσχήκει, ὡς ὁ κατὰ τὴν Σικελίαν Εὔνους.	And if he had not died in a battle fought against Licinius Crassus, he would have caused no ordinary trouble to our countrymen, as Eunus did in Sicily.
Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἐρωτήσῃ σε ὁ υἱός σου αὔριον λέγων Τί ἐστιν τὰ μαρτύρια καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν;	“ ‘And it shall be, when your son asks you at a future time saying, “What are the testimonies and the ordinances and the judgments that the Lord our God commanded you?”
ὁ δὲ ἀφικόμενος καὶ ἀγῶνά τινα πρόφασιν γυμνικὸν ἔξω τοῦ φρουρίου ποιήσας, ὡς ἐξῆλθε τὸ ἄλλο φρούριον, ἀπέκλῃσε τὰς πύλας·	This general, under color of a gymnastic contest which he arranged on his arrival, got the rest of the garrison out of the place, and shut the gates behind them.
δωρησάμενος δὲ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τὰς ἐκ τῶν σκύλων ὠφελείας καὶ ὡς αἰτιωτάτοις τῆς νίκης αὐτῷ γεγενημένοις εὐχαριστήσας ἀπέπεμψεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα πρὸς Ἰωνάθην μαρτυρῶν αὐτῷ τῆς συμμαχίας.	and when he had given rewards to the Jews out of the rich spoils he had gotten, and had returned them thanks, as the cause of his victory, he sent them away to Jerusalem to Jonathan, with an ample testimony of the assistance they had afforded him.
μισούμεναί γε μὴν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπεκράτουν.	yet although these women were hated by him, they domineered over others
δικαιοτάτη οὖν βραχίονος κατάτασις ἥδε·	The following, then, is the most natural plan of setting the arm
κήρυγμα ἐποιήσατο τὰ ἡμίσεα ὧν ἔχει ἕκαστος ἀναφέρειν πρὸς αὑτόν, τὰ δ’ ἡμίσεα ἔχειν τὸν λαβόντα·	he made proclamation that each should bring him, under pain of death, one-half of what he had
δέομαι οὖν ὑμῶν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, ἀκούσαντας ἀμφοτέρων ἡμῶν καὶ αὐτοὺς δοκιμαστὰς τοῦ πράγματος γενομένους μάλιστα μὲν διαλλάξαντας ἀποπέμψαι καὶ εὐεργέτας ἡμῶν ἀμφοτέρων ὑμᾶς γενέσθαι, ἐὰν δ’ ἄρα μὴ ἐπιτυγχάνητε τούτου, ἐκ τῶν ὑπολοίπων τῷ τὰ δίκαια λέγοντι, τούτῳ τὴν ψῆφον ὑμᾶς προσθέσθαι. πρῶτον μὲν οὖν μαρτυρίας ἀναγνώσεται ὅτι οὐκ ἐγὼ αἴτιός εἰμι τοῦ εἰς τὸ δικαστήριον εἰσιέναι, ἀλλ’ οὗτος αὐτός.	I beg of you, therefore, men of the jury, when you have heard us both and have sifted the matter for yourselves, preferably to find some settlement of our quarrel and dismiss us, and thus become benefactors of us both but if you cannot succeed in this, of the courses remaining open to you, I beg you to give your vote to him whose plea is just.First, then, the clerk shall read to you the depositions which show that it is not I who am responsible for bringing the case into court, but the defendant himself.
ὅτε δὲ ἀνεπληρώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ γάμου, ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πότον τοῖς ἔθνεσιν τοῖς εὑρεθεῖσιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας ἓξ ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως,	when the days of the wedding feast were completed, the king held a drinking party for the people who were found in the city. It lasted for six days in the courtyard of the king’s palace.
γάμον οὖν ὑπὸ θείας μνηστευόμενον ἐπιφανείας καὶ ὑμεῖς κυρώσατε καὶ Ἅβραμον τὸν μετὰ τοσαύτης ἀπεσταλκότα σπουδῆς τῷ κατανεῦσαι τὴν κόρην τιμήσατε.	Do you therefore confirm that marriage, whose espousals have been already made by a Divine appearance and show the respect you have for Abraham, who hath sent me with so much solicitude, in giving your consent to the marriage of this damsel."
καὶ γὰρ καὶ ἐπίνοιαι πᾶσαι ἀπὸ τῶν αἰσθήσεων γεγόνασι κατά τε περίπτωσιν καὶ ἀναλογίαν καὶ ὁμοιότητα καὶ σύνθεσιν, συμβαλλομένου τι καὶ τοῦ λογισμοῦ.	For all our notions are derived from perceptions, either by actual contact or by analogy, or resemblance, or composition, with some slight aid from reasoning.
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡ περιτομή, ἐφ’ ᾗ πεποίθασιν, κατήργηται, περιτομὴν γὰρ εἴρηκεν οὐ σαρκὸς γενηθῆναι· ἀλλὰ παρέβησαν, ὅτι ἄγγελος πονηρὸς ἐσόφιζεν αὐτούς.	But moreover the circumcision in which they trusted has been abolished. For he declared that circumcision was not of the flesh, but they erred because an evil angel was misleading them.
Ἀγαπήνωρ δὲ ὁ Ἀγκαίου τοῦ Λυκούργου μετὰ Ἔχεμον βασιλεύσας ἐς Τροίαν ἡγήσατο Ἀρκάσιν.	Agapenor, the son of Ancaeus, the son of Lycurgus, who was king after Echemus, led the Arcadians to Troy.
τοῖς δ’ ἐν τῇ Καρχηδόνι βουλομένοις μὲν εἰδέναι τὰ περὶ τὸ Λιλύβαιον, οὐ δυναμένοις δὲ διὰ τὸ τοὺς μὲν συγκεκλεῖσθαι τοὺς δὲ παραφυλάττεσθαι φιλοτίμως, ἐπηγγείλατό τις ἀνὴρ τῶν ἐνδόξων, Ἀννίβας ἐπικαλούμενος Ῥόδιος, εἰσπλεύσας εἰς τὸ Λιλύβαιον καὶ γενόμενος αὐτόπτης ἅπαντα διασαφήσειν.	Now the Carthaginian government were anxious to learn the state of affairs at Lilybaeum, but could not do so because the garrison was strictly blockaded, and the Romans were exceedingly vigilant. In this difficulty a nobleman, called Hannibal the Rhodian, came to them, and offered to run the blockade, to see what was going on in Lilybaeum with his own eyes, and to report.
διέφθειρον γὰρ προσιόντες τοὺς στρατιώτας, καὶ ἕνα γε λοχαγὸν διέφθειραν Νίκαρχον Ἀρκάδα, καὶ ᾤχετο ἀπιὼν νυκτὸς σὺν ἀνθρώποις ὡς εἴκοσι.	For the barbarians kept coming and trying to corrupt the soldiers in the case of one captain, Nicarchus the Arcadian, they actually succeeded, and he decamped during the night, taking with him about twenty men.
οὕτω γὰρ οἱ πλεῖστοι λέγουσι· Φιλόχορος δὲ καὶ σπονδὰς περὶ νεκρῶν ἀναιρέσεως γενέσθαι πρώτας ἐκείνας.	for so most writers say, and Philochorus adds that this was the first truce ever made for recovering the bodies of those slain in battle,
τῷ δ’ αὐτῷ χρόνῳ καὶ Μινούκιος Βάσιλος, σφαγεὺς καὶ ὅδε Καίσαρος, ὑπὸ τῶν θεραπόντων ἀνῃρέθη, εὐνουχίζων τινὰς αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τιμωρίᾳ.	About the same time Minucius Basilus, another of Cæsar's murderers, was killed by his slaves, some of whom he was castrating by way of punishment.
αἴλινον αἴλινον εἰπέ, τὸ δ’ εὖ νικάτω.	Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail!
νῦν δ’ εἰσὶν οἰκεῖοι, Πόντου δὲ καὶ Βιθυνίας πέμπεταί τις ἀπὸ τῆς βουλῆς στρατηγὸς ἐτήσιος τὰ δ’ ἑτέροις ὑπὸ τοῦ Πομπηίου δεδομένα ὁ μὲν Γάιος, ἐπιμεμψάμενος τοῖς ἔχουσιν ὅτι Πομπηίῳ καθ’ αὑτοῦ συνεμάχουν, ὅμως ἐφύλαξε, πλὴν τῆς ἐν Κομάνοις ἱερωσύνης, ἣν ἐς Λυκομήδην μετήνεγκεν ἀπὸ Ἀρχελάου·	But the people of Bosporus now had rulers of their own and a prætor was sent by the Senate yearly to govern Pontus and Bithynia. Although Cæsar was offended with the other rulers who held their possessions as gifts from Pompey, since they had aided Pompey against him, nevertheless he confirmed their titles, except the priesthood of Comana which he took from Archelaus and gave to Lycomedes.
καλῶς τοίνυν ἂν ἡμῖν ἡ πρεσβυτῶν ἔμφρων παιδιὰ μέχρι δεῦρ’ εἴη τὰ νῦν διαπεπαισμένη.	It seems, then, that up to now our ancients’ game of reason has been finely played.
ὡς πάντα ἡμῖν τῆς θείας δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ τὰ πρὸς ζωὴν καὶ εὐσέβειαν δεδωρημένης, διὰ τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως τοῦ καλέσαντος ἡμᾶς διὰ δόξης καὶ ἀρετῆς·	as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,
ὃ δ’ οὐ πάρεστιν οὐδὲ μὴ μόλῃ ποτέ.	He is nowhere near, and he certainly will never come.
οἱ δὲ λόγον οὐκ ἐποιοῦντο Σκέδασος δὲ ταῦτα ἀκούων ἀθύμως διέκειτο, ὑπολαμβάνων ὅτι οὐδ’ αὐτοῦ λόγον τινὰ ποιήσονται οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται ἐν μέρει τε τὴν οἰκείαν διηγήσατο συμφορὰν τῷ ξένῳ·	Scedasus, having heard this relation, remained very much dejected, believing he should have no better success. However, in his turn, he gave an account to the stranger of his own sad mischance
Ἐν δὲ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ ἀπεστάλη ὁ ἄγγελος Γαβριὴλ ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς πόλιν τῆς Γαλιλαίας, ᾗ ὄνομα Ναζαρέτ,	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
ταῦτα δὲ διακόνου τέχνης ἐστί που μόρια ἀμφότερα.	now these are both part of a servant’s art.
Ἐὰν παύσωνται οἱ νόμοι οὗτοι ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, φησὶν Κύριος, καὶ τὸ γένος Ἰσραὴλ παύσεται γενέσθαι ἔθνος κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.	“If these laws cease from before me,” declares the Lord, “then the race of Israel will cease to be a people before ⌊me⌋ ⌊always⌋.
τῶν δὲ Θρᾳκῶν ἁπάντων χαλεπῶς ἐνεγκόντων ἐπὶ τούτοις, καὶ συστραφέντων τοῦ τε Βηρισάδου καὶ τοῦ Ἀμαδόκου, ἰδὼν τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον Ἀθηνόδωρος, συμμαχίαν ποιησάμενος πρὸς τούτους οἷος ἦν πολεμεῖν.	These atrocities moved the whole population of Thrace to resentment Berisades and Amadocus made a coalition and Athenodorus, recognizing a favorable opportunity, formed alliance with them, and so was in a position to make war.
καὶ πορεύσονται πόλεις Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ κεκράξονται πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς οἷς αὐτοὶ θυμιῶσιν αὐτοῖς, μὴ σώσουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῶν κακῶν αὐτῶν.	And the cities of Judah and those who dwell in Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense. Will they deliver them in the time of their calamities?
δίδωσιν δὲ καὶ τὰς ἐντὸς Ἐλευθέρου ποταμοῦ πόλεις ἄχρις Αἰγύπτου χωρὶς Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος, ἐκ προγόνων εἰδὼς ἐλευθέρας, πολλὰ λιπαρούσης αὐτῆς αὐτῇ δοθῆναι.	So he gave her the cities that were on her side of the river Eleutherus as far as Egypt, except Tyre and Sidon which he knew to have been free cities from of old, although she often cajoled him about them too.
τὸ γὰρ κάλλος ἐξεβοήθη τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ·	for the fame of his wife's beauty was greatly talked of
Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Ἀμορραίων οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς Φοινίκης οἱ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν, ὅτι ἀπεξήρανεν Κύριος ὁ θεὸς τὸν Ἰορδάνην ⸆ ποταμὸν ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ διαβαίνειν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐτάκησαν αὐτῶν αἱ διάνοιαι καὶ κατεπλάγησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς φρόνησις οὐδεμία ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.	And it happened that when they heard, both the king of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan and the king of the Phoenicians by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the Jordan River before the children of Israel during their crossing, their minds melted and they were astounded, and there was no wisdom in them, none at all before the presence of the children of Israel.
ὧν ὅστις βούλεται, ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ λόγῳ ἀναβάς με ἐλεγξάτω ἢ ὡς ἔφυγέ τις δι᾽ ἐμὲ τούτων τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἢ ὡς ἀπέθανεν. ἐπειδὴ δὲ ταῦτα ἐγένετο, Πείσανδρος καὶ Χαρικλῆς, ὄντες μὲν τῶν ζητητῶν, δοκοῦντες δ᾽ ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ χρόνῳ εὐνούστατοι εἶναι τῷ δήμῳ, ἔλεγον ὡς εἴη τὰ ἔργα τὰ γεγενημένα οὐκ ὀλίγων ἀνδρῶν ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ δήμου καταλύσει, καὶ χρῆναι ἐπιζητεῖν καὶ μὴ παύσασθαι. καὶ ἡ πόλις οὕτω διέκειτο, ὥστ᾽ ἐπειδὴ τὴν βουλὴν εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον ὁ κῆρυξ ἀνείποι ἰέναι καὶ τὸ σημεῖον καθέλοι, τῷ αὐτῷ σημείῳ ἡ μὲν	any of them is welcome to step up here, during the time now allotted me, and prove against me that i caused either the exile or the death of a single one. and now for what followed. peisander and charicles, who were regarded in those days as the most fervent of democrats, were members of the commission of inquiry. these two maintained that the outrage was not the work of a small group of criminals, but an organized attempt to overthrow the popular government: and that therefore inquiries ought still to
δίκαιον δὲ τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τὴν κρίσιν ἕπεσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἀσθενείᾳ τοῦ κρίνοντος ἀπιστεῖσθαι.	However, it is right that our verdict should accord with the reputation of the man, rather than that his virtue should be discredited through weakness in the judge.
τῶν δὲ φανερῶν γενομένων καὶ συναχθέντων εἰς τὸ δημόσιον Θεόπομπος μὲν ἑκατὸν τάλαντα, Θεόφραστος δὲ ὀγδοήκοντά φησι γενέσθαι τὸ πλῆθος, οὐδὲ τριῶν ἄξια ταλάντων κεκτημένου τοῦ Θεμιστοκλέους πρὶν ἅπτεσθαι τῆς πολιτείας.	but the sum total of that which was brought to light and confiscated amounted to one hundred talents, according to Theopompus,—Theophrastus says eighty,—and yet Themistocles did not possess the worth of three talents before he entered political life.
’ Σῆμος δ’ ὁ Δήλιος ἐν τῷ περὶ Παιάνων φησί · ‘τὰ δράγματα τῶν κριθῶν αὐτὰ καθ’ αὑτὰ προσηγόρευον ἀμάλας·	And Semus the Delian, in his treatise on Pæans, says—'"They used to call the handfuls of barley taken separately, ἄμάλαι
ὁρῶ γὰρ αὐτοὺς τὸ μὲν πρῶτον, ὅπως καταλύσωσι τὸν δῆμον, προσλαβόντας τινὰς τῶν πολιτῶν, ἐπειδὴ δὲ τοῦτ’ ἔπραξαν, πάλιν ἐκβαλόντας τούτους·	For I notice that at the start, in order to overthrow the democracy, they enlisted some of the citizens on their side, and when they had succeeded, sent them into banishment again.
εἰ μὲν γὰρ χρησταὶ αἱ ἐπιθυμίαι, φαύλη ἡ κωλύουσα ἕξις μὴ ἀκολουθεῖν, ὥσθ’ ἡ ἐγκράτεια οὐ πᾶσα σπουδαία·	since if a man's desires are good, the disposition that prevents him from obeying them will be evil, and so Self-restraint will not always be good
τοῦτο οὐκ ἔστιν φίλαυτον· γέγονε γὰρ οὕτως τὸ ζῷον· αὑτοῦ ἕνεκα πάντα ποιεῖ.	This is not a perverse self-regard, for the animal is constituted so as to do all things for itself.
καὶ γὰρ τὸν Οἰδίποδα τοῖς μεγίστοις κακοῖς ἡ περιεργία περιέβαλε·	It was, in fact, curiosity which involved Oedipus in the greatest calamities.
αὖθις δὲ ληφθέντα πληγαῖς κολάζουσι, γνωρίσαντες ἐκ τοῦ διαρράμματος.	If they take him a second time, they punish him with stripes, well knowing him again by the prints of the needle.
δεῦρο δὴ πάλιν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, ὦ ἄριστε. ἐπιστήμην πότερον δύναμίν τινα φῂς εἶναι αὐτήν, ἢ εἰς τί γένος τιθεῖς;	To return, then, my friend, said I, to science or true knowledge, do you say that it is a faculty and a power, or in what class do you put it?
ὥσπερ οὖν ἐν ταῖς ἀπαντήσεσιν ὁ μὲν φίλος ἔστιν ὅτε μήτ’ εἰπὼν μήτ’ ἀκούσας μηδὲν ἀλλὰ προσβλέψας καὶ μειδιάσας τὸ εὐμενὲς καὶ τὸ οἰκεῖον ἔνδοθεν δοὺς ταῖς ὄψεσι καὶ δεξάμενος παρῆλθεν, ὁ δὲ κόλαξ τρέχει καταδιώκει δεξιοῦται πόρρωθεν, ἂν προσαγορευθῇ πρότερον ὀφθείς, ἀπολογεῖται μετὰ μαρτύρων καὶ ὅρκων πολλάκις, οὕτως ἐν ταῖς πράξεσι πολλὰ παραλείπουσιν οἱ φίλοι τῶν μικρῶν, οὐκ ἐξακριβοῦντες οὐδὲ πολυπραγμονοῦντες οὐδέν, οὐδ’ ἑαυτοὺς εἰς πᾶσαν ὑπουργίαν ἐμβάλλοντες.	Take the case of one person meeting another a friend sometimes, without the exchange of a word, but merely by a glance and a smile, gives and receives through the medium of the eyes an intimation of the goodwill and intimacy that is in the heart, and passes on. But the flatterer runs, pursues, extends his greeting at a distance, and if he be seen and spoken to first, he pleads his defence with witnesses and oaths over and over again. It is the same with actions
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, λέγω ὅτι οὗτος διὰ τοῦτο τοῖς οἰκείοις καὶ τοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἐμοῖς, τοῖς εἰδόσιν ἀκριβῶς ἅπαντα ταῦτα τὰ πράγματα ὡς ἔχει καὶ παρηκολουθηκόσιν ἐξ ἀρχῆς, οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἐπιτρέψαι·	In the first place, men of the jury, I say that the defendant refused to refer our differences to our common friends and relatives who had full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case, and had followed them from the beginning
οὐαὶ δέ μοι διὰ παντός, ὅτι οὐδὲ λόγῳἀμείψασθαι θέλεις·	but woe is me alway, for thou wilt not even answer me a word
τό τε ῥᾴθυμον καὶ τὸ ὑπνηρὸν ἔνεστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἰδεῖν· ἔς τε τὰς τέχνας παχέες καὶ οὐ λεπτοὶ οὐδ’ ὀξέες.	indolence and sluggishness are visible in them, and to the arts they are dull, and not clever nor acute.
ἔτι τοίνυν ἀρχὰς ἔλαχεν καὶ ἦρξεν δοκιμασθείς.	And furthermore, he was chosen to offices by lot, and he passed the probationary test, and held office.
καὶ τὸ πῦρ ὑπό τε πολλῶν προστεθειμένον καὶ μετὰ τῶν ἐγείρειν φλόγα δυναμένων ἥπτετο τοῦ ὀρόφου ᾗ τάχος.	This fire being fed by a great deal of combustible matter, caught hold immediately on the roof of the cloisters
εἰ γάρ, ὡς οὗτοι λέγουσι, τῷ μὲν Φιλοκτήμονι μὴ ἐξῆν διαθέσθαι, τοῦ δ’ Εὐκτήμονός ἐστιν ὁ κλῆρος, πότερον δικαιότερον τῶν Εὐκτήμονος κληρονομεῖν τὰς ἐκείνου θυγατέρας, ὁμολογουμένως οὔσας γνησίας, καὶ ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἐκ τούτων γεγονότας, ἢ τοὺς οὐδὲν προσήκοντας, οἳ οὐ μόνον ὑφ’ ἡμῶν ἐλέγχονται,	For if, as they assert, Philoctemon had no right to make a will, and the estate was Euctemon's, who have a better right to inherit Euctemon's property? His daughters, who are admittedly legitimate, and we who are their sons?
ἄστρον. μὲν γὰρ ἢ πῦρ οὐκ ἂν ἐν σκιᾷ διαφανείη μέλαν ἢ γλαυκὸν ἢ κυανοειδές·	For it is not to be denied but that a star of fire cannot appear in a shadow black, gray, or violet
ἐντεῦθεν δ’ ἐπορεύθησαν σταθμοὺς δύο παρασάγγας δέκα μέχρι ὑπερῆλθον τὰς πηγὰς τοῦ Τίγρητος ποταμοῦ.	From there they marched two stages, ten parasangs, until they passed the headwaters of the Tigris river.
’ Δημήτριος δ’ ὁ Σκήψιος ἐν τῷ ιεʹ τοῦ Τρωικοῦ διακόσμου εὐφώνους φησὶ γίνεσθαι τοὺς μὴ σύκων ἐσθίοντας.	But Demetrius the Scepsian, in the fifteenth book of the Trojan Preparation, says, that those who never eat figs have the best voices.
εἰ μέν σοι ἤδη πάρεστιν, ὡς λέγει Κριτίας ὅδε, σωφροσύνη καὶ εἶ σώφρων ἱκανῶς, οὐδὲν ἔτι σοι ἔδει οὔτε τῶν Ζαλμόξιδος οὔτε τῶν Ἀβάριδος τοῦ Ὑπερβορέου ἐπῳδῶν, ἀλλ’ αὐτό σοι ἂν ἤδη δοτέον εἴη τὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς φάρμακον·	if you already possess temperance, as Critias here declares, and you are sufficiently temperate, then you never had any need of the charms of Zalmoxis or of Abaris the Hyperborean, and might well be given at once the remedy for the head
καὶ πρὸς ποδῶν ἕτερον οἴκημα τρίκλινον, οὗ τάλαντα τρισχίλια ἔκειτο ἀργυρίου, καὶ προσηγορεύετο βασιλικὸν ὑποπόδιον.	And at his feet was another supper-room, prepared with three couches, in which there were constantly kept three thousand talents of silver and this was called the king's footstool.
ἔστιν, ἀλλ’ οὐ προηγούμενα οὐδὲ μέρη θεῶν.	but they are not superior things, nor yet parts of the Gods.
Συνέβη δὲ εἰς τοσοῦτον τὸν μὲν δῆμον ταπεινότητος καὶ δέους, ἐκείνους δὲ ἀπονοίας προελθεῖν, ὡς ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς εἶναι καὶ τὰς χειροτονίας τῶν ἀρχιερέων.	Now the people were come to that degree of meanness and fear, and these robbers to that degree of madness, that these last took upon them to appoint high priests.
ὥσπερ ζητεῖ ὁ ποιμὴν τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὅταν ᾖ γνόφος καὶ νεφέλη ἐν μέσῳ προβάτων διακεχωρισμένων, οὕτως ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου καὶ ἀπελάσω αὐτὰ ἀπὸ παντὸς τόπου οὗ διεσπάρησαν ἐκεῖ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νεφέλης καὶ γνόφου.	Just as the shepherd seeks his flock on the day when there is darkness and a cloud in the midst of the separated sheep, so I will seek out my sheep and drive them away from everywhere they were scattered on the day of cloud and darkness.
ἐκεῖ δὲ συνελθόντες ἐψηφίσαντο μὴ διδόναι χρήματα αὐτῷ μηδὲ μισθοφόρους τρέφειν ἀλλ’ αὑτῷ πορίζειν, εἰ δέοιτο πολεμεῖν.	Here they held an assembly, and voted not to give him money and not to maintain mercenaries for him if he wanted to wage war, he must provide the means himself.
τυρὸς γάρ, ἐπειδὴ τούτῳ σημείῳ ἐχρησάμην, οὐ πάντας ἀνθρώπους ὁμοίως λυμαίνεται, ἀλλ’ εἰσὶν οἵτινες αὐτοῦ πληρούμενοι οὐδ’ ὁτιοῦν βλάπτονται, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἰσχύν, οἷσιν ἂν συμφέρῃ, θαυμασίως παρέχεται. εἰσὶ δ’ οἳ χαλεπῶς ἀπαλλάσσουσι.	For cheese (since we used it as an example) does not prove equally injurious to all men, for there are some who can take it to satiety without being hurt by it in the least, but, on the contrary, it is wonderful what strength it imparts to those it agrees with
οὐ πρέπει θοινωμένους κλύειν στεναγμῶν οὐδὲ λυπεῖσθαι ξένους.	for ’tis not seemly that guests when at their meat should hear the voice of weeping or be made sad. [Exit HERACLES.
τούτους γὰρ Πτολεμαῖος ἀναγαγὼν ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος ἐξ ἀπόπτου ᾐκίζετο καὶ κατακρημνίσειν οὐκ ἀφισταμένου τῆς πολιορκίας ἠπείλει.	for Ptolemy brought them upon the wall, and tormented them in the sight of all, and threatened that he would throw them down headlong, unless Hyrcanus would leave off the siege.
ὁρῶ σε, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀράσπα, φοβούμενόν τε ἐμὲ καὶ ἐν αἰσχύνῃ δεινῶς ἔχοντα.	I see, Araspas, said he, that you are afraid of me and terribly overcome with shame.
μὴ δῆθ᾽, ἱκετεύω σ᾽, ἀλλὰ μίσθωσαί τινα τῶν ἐκφερομένων, ὅστις ἐπὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἔρχεται.	no, please, i beg you, but hire someone from the funeral party, who's coming just for this.
καί ῥά μιν χώρας ἀκλάρωτον λίπον, ἁγνὸν θεόν.	in fact they left him without any allotment of land, although he was a holy god.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις τί ἂν τοὺς παῖδας καλὸν γάρ τοι μηδὲν εἰκῇ μήτε λέγειν μήτε πράττειν, καὶ κατὰ τὴν παροιμίαν χαλεπὰ τὰ καλά.	If any one ask what the next thing is wherein I would have children instructed, and to what further good qualities I would have them inured, I answer, that I think it advisable that they neither speak nor do any thing rashly
Ὑπὸ τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ καιρὸν παραγενόμενός τις πρὸς Ἰωνάθην καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ Σίμωνα τοὺς Ἀμαραίου παῖδας ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς γάμον ἐπιτελοῦντας καὶ τὴν νύμφην ἄγοντας ἀπὸ Ναβαθὰ πόλεως θυγατέρα τινὸς οὖσαν τῶν ἐπιφανῶν παρὰ τοῖς Ἄραψιν, μέλλειν δὲ γίνεσθαι παραπομπὴν τῆς κόρης λαμπρὰν καὶ πολυτελῆ.	About that time someone came to Jonathan and his brother Simon to tell them that the sons of Ambri were celebrating a marriage and bringing the bride, the daughter of a famous man among the Arabs, from the city of Gabatha, and that the girl was to be conducted with pomp and great splendor.
πλὴν αἱ μὲν εἰς ἀντικείμενα ὡδί, ἡ δ’ ὡδί, ἡ κίνησις.	motion, is a change into opposites in another sense.
πρότερον γὰρ οὐκ, ἐγάμουν τὰς ἀφ’ αἵματος, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ νῦν τηθίδας οὐδ’ ἀδελφὰς γαμοῦσιν; ἀλλ’ ὀψὲ συνεχώρησαν ἀνεψιαῖς συνοικεῖν ἐκ τοιαύτης αἰτίας.	For in former time they did not marry women nigh by blood,— as now they marry not aunts or sisters,—but of late they allowed the marrying of cousins for the following reason.
ΚΩΝΟΙ. Μνησίθεος ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ἰατρὸς ἐν τῷ περὶ ἐδεστῶν ὀστρακίδας καλεῖ τῶν κώνων τοὺς πυρῆνας, ἔτι δὲ κώνους.	With respect to Pine-cones.—Mnesitheus, the Athenian physician, in his book on Comestibles, calls the husks of the pine-cones ὀστρακίδες, and in another place he calls them κῶνοι.
εἰ δὲ δούλη, μάλιστα μὲν τὸν πριάμενον, εἰ δὲ μή, τὸν ἀποδόμενον ἥκειν καταμαρτυροῦντα, εἰ δὲ μή, τῶν ἄλλων τινά, ἢ ὡς ἐδούλευσεν ἢ ὡς ἀφείθη ἐλευθέρα.	and if she were a slave, then the one who had bought her should by all means have come to give evidence against her, or the one who sold her, or in default of them, someone else to prove that she had lived as a slave or had been set free.
ὡς ἔγωγε πρῶτον μὲν ἀκούσας τὸ γινόμενον ἐθαύμασα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐβουλήθην αὐτόπτης αὐτοῦ καταστῆναι.	When, for my own part, I first learned of what happens, I was surprised, and felt anxious to see it with my own eyes.
εἶχον, ἀλλ’ ἐφύλασσον τοὺς πατρίους νόμους καὶ κεκολασμένως ἔζων τηροῦντες τὰ τῆς πολιτείας ἔθη.	To be sure they had, but they abided by the laws of their country, and lived with moderation, preserving the habits sanctioned by the constitution.
τὸ δὲ συνεχὲς καὶ πεπερασμένον, ὅταν ἕν τι ἐκ πλειόνων ᾖ, ἐνυπαρχόντων μάλιστα μὲν δυνάμει, εἰ δὲ μή, ἐνεργείᾳ.	And (2) that which is continuous and limited is a whole when it is a unity composed of several parts (especially if the parts are only potentially present in it but otherwise even if they are present actually).
προσυπογράψομεν δὲ καὶ τὰ κοινῇ ἀρέσκοντα αὐτοῖς, αἵρεσιν καὶ ταύτην εἶναι ἐγκρίνοντες τὴν φιλοσοφίαν, οὐ, καθά φασί τινες, ἔνστασιν βίου.	But we will go on to append the doctrines which they held in common—if, that is, we decide that Cynicism is really a philosophy, and not, as some maintain, just a way of life.
καὶ κόσμον δὲ καὶ κατασκευὴν τὴν πλείστου ἀξίαν συναπέπεμπε προπομποὺς δοὺς αὐτοῖς.	And he sent along with them his most valuable jewels and chattels and gave them an escort.
καὶ εἶπας Εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσομαι ἄρχουσα. οὐκ ἐνόησας ταῦτα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, οὐδὲ ἐμνήσθης τὰ ἔσχατα.	And you said, “I will be ruler ⌊forever⌋.” You have not perceived these things in your heart or remembered the final things.
κἀκεῖνον μέν, ᾧ καὶ ἀναγκαῖον εὖ ποιεῖν ἡμᾶς καὶ αἰσχρὸν ἡμῶν ἀμελῆσαι, μηδὲν τῶν αὑτοῦ ἡμῖν δοῦναι· τούτους δέ, οἷς οὔτ’ ἀνάγκη ἐστὶν οὔτ’ αἰσχύνην οὐδεμίαν φέρει, τῶν οὐ προσηκόντων, ὥς φασιν, ἡμῖν μεταδιδόναι;	and that he, who was bound to treat us well and in whom it would have been disgraceful to neglect us, left us none of his property, whereas these men, who are under no obligation to us and whose disregard of us involves no disgrace, offered us a share of the property to which, as they say, we have no claim?
εἴποις ἂν οὖν μοι τίνα ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχει Βάκις τε καὶ Σίβυλλα καὶ ὁ ἡμεδαπὸς Ἀμφίλυτος;	Now, can you tell me what appellation is given to Bacis and Sibyl and our native Amphilytus?
μὴ θαυμάσῃς ὅτι εἶπόν σοι· δεῖ ὑμᾶς γεννηθῆναι ἄνωθεν.	Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must all be born from above.'
ἐνθάδε κέκρυπται σπάργαν’ οἷς ἐνῆσθα σύ.	Herein were laid the swaddling-clothes in which thou wert enwrapped.
ὡς δ' ἀπειλοῦντος καὶ βιαζομένου τοῖς φόβοις τἀληθὲς εἶπον, προχεῖται μὲν αὐτῷ πληγέντι τὴν διάνοιαν ὑπὸ τοῦ συνειδότος πολλὰ δάκρυα, βύθιον δὲ ἀνοιμώξας, "οὐκ ἄρ', εἶπεν, λήσειν ἐπ' ἀσεβέσιν οὕτω καὶ μιαροῖς τολμήμασι τὸν θεὸν ἔμελλον, ἀλλά με ταχεῖα ποινὴ συγγενοῦς φόνου μετελήλυθεν.	As he forced the truth out them by threats and by fear, the awareness of what he had done deranged his mind and caused him to shed floods of tears. With a deep groan he said, "I see that God will not ignore such an impious outrage as the murder of my kinsman, for the punishment is suddenly coming upon me.
ἐπεὶ τό γε εὅρημα καὶ μέγα καὶ πολλῆς τέχνης τε καὶ σκέψιος.	Nevertheless the discovery was a great one, implying much investigation and art.
νῦν μέντοι γε ποιήσειν αὐτοὺς τῷ μὲν θεῷ κεχαρισμένα συμφέροντα δὲ αὐτοῖς ἀποπεμψαμένους τὰς γυναῖκας.	but that now they would do a thing both pleasing to God, and advantageous to themselves, if they would put those wives away.
αἰαῖ Λειψύδριον προδωσέταιρον, οἵους ἄνδρας ἀπώλεσας, μάχεσθαι ἀγαθούς τε καὶ εὐπατρίδας, οἳ τότ᾽ ἔδειξαν οἵων πατέρων ἔσαν. ἀποτυγχάνοντες οὖν ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς ἄλλοις, ἐμισθώσαντο τὸν ἐν Δελφοῖς νεὼν οἰκοδομεῖν, ὅθεν εὐπόρησαν χρημάτων πρὸς τὴν τῶν Λακώνων βοήθειαν.	faithless dry fountain! lackaday, what good men's lives you threw away! true patriots and fighters game, they showed the stock from which they came! so as they were failing in everything else, they contracted to build the temple at delphi, and so acquired a supply of money for the assistance of the spartans.
μὴ γὰρ ἃς οἱ ποιηταὶ ταῖς εἰκόσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἀνδριᾶσι μεγαληγορίας ἐπεχάραττον, οὐ τῆς μετριότητος ἀλλὰ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου στοχαζόμενοι, σκοπῶμεν·	Let us, then, pay no heed to the proud boasts which the poets inscribed upon his portraits and statues, studying, as they were, to portray, not Alexander’s moderation, but his power
καὶ μήν, τεττάρων ὄντων τῶν στοιχείων, τὸ ὕδωρ ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ πέμπτον, ὡς ἄν τις εἴποι, πεποίηκε στοιχεῖον τὴν θάλασσαν, οὐδὲν ἧττον ἐκείνων ὠφέλιμον τῶν τ’ ἄλλων ἕνεκεν καὶ μάλιστα τῆς ἐπιμιξίας·	Then again, there being four elements, water produces a fifth out of itself, which is the sea, no less beneficial than the rest, as well for commerce as for many other things.
ὅλαις δ’ αὐταῖς ἄργυρος ἦν ἐπικεχαλκωμένος πάρεξ τῶν βάσεων· χαλκαῖ γὰρ ἦσαν.	These were made wholly of silver, and polished, and that all over, excepting the bases, which were of brass.
οὐκ ἔγωγε, φάναι τὸν Φίλιππον, ἀλλ’ ἀνθ’ ὑπάτων, ὡς ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς τότε ὑπατεύοντας οὐδενὸς ἀξίους ὄντας.	No indeed! said Philippus, but as pro-consuls, implying that both the consuls of that year were good for nothing.
ἔτι νῦν τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν παράβαλλ᾽ ἐς Καρίαν τὸν δεξιόν, τὸν δ᾽ ἕτερον ἐς Καρχηδόνα.	furthermore, turn your right eye towards caria and your left toward carthage!
καὶ ἐγενόμην ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἀκούων καὶ οὐκ ἔχων ἐν στόματι αὐτοῦ ἐλεγμούς.	And I have become like a person not hearing and not having reproofs in his mouth.
καὶ ὃ μὴ αἰσθάνεται, ὧν μὴ αἰσθάνεται· καὶ ὃ μὴ αἰσθάνεται, ὧν αἰσθάνεται.	nor that what he does not perceive is something else which he does not perceive nor that what he does not perceive is something which he perceives.
τῶν δ’ ἀρχῶν ὅσαι τοιαῦται, ὅθεν πρῶτον αἱ κινήσεις, κύριαι λέγονται, μάλιστα δὲ δικαίως ἀφ’ ὧν μὴ ἐνδέχεται ἄλλως, ἣν ἴσως ὁ θεὸς ἄρχει.	And the first principles of that sort, which are the first source of motions, are called first principles in the strict sense, and most rightly those that have necessary results doubtless God is a ruling principle that acts in this way.
ῥηθέντων δὲ τούτων πρῶτος μὲν Ἀριστείδης συνεχώρησεν ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἀθηναίων, ἔπειτα Παυσανίας ὑπὲρ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων.	To this proposal Aristides was first to agree on behalf of the Athenians, then Pausanias on behalf of the Lacedaemonians.
νῦν γὰρ λέβητος χαλκέου πλευρώματα σποδὸν κέκευθεν ἀνδρὸς εὖ κεκλαυμένου.	In the meantime a bronze urn contains the ashes of a man rightly lamented.
καὶ πᾶς ὁ καταλειπόμενος ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τόπων οὗ αὐτὸς παροικεῖ ἐκεῖ, καὶ λήμψονται αὐτὸν ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀποσκευῇ καὶ κτήνεσιν μετὰ τοῦ ἑκουσίου εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ.	And all who are left from all the places where he dwells there, and the men of his place shall receive him with silver and gold and goods and cattle along with the voluntary offering for the house of the God who is in Jerusalem.
ἀνάτεινόν ποτε τὸν τράχηλον ὡς ἀπηλλαγμένος δουλείας, τόλμησον ἀναβλέψας πρὸς τὸν θεὸν εἰπεῖν ὅτι χρῶ μοι λοιπὸν εἰς ὃ ἂν θέλῃς·	Lift up your head at last, as being free from slavery. Dare to look up to God, and say, Make use of me for the future as Thou wilt. I am of the same mind
ἴθι δὴ σκεψώμεθα τοὺς λοιποὺς προσελθόντες ἐγγύθεν, ἵνα αὐτοὺς εἰδῶμεν βεβαιότερον.	Come then, let us step up and look from close at hand at those who are left, that so we may know them more surely.
τότε ἀπαχθήσονται εἰς τὸ χάος τοῦ πυρὸς καὶ εἰς τὴν βάσανον καὶ εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον συνκλείσεως αἰῶνος.	Then they will be led away into the gaping abyss of fire and into the torture and into the jail, being shut up forever.
ἀλλὰ μὴν εἰ μέχρι τῆς δεκάδος ὁ ἀριθμός, ὥσπερ τινές φασιν, πρῶτον μὲν ταχὺ ἐπιλείψει τὰ εἴδη οἷον εἰ ἔστιν ἡ τριὰς αὐτοάνθρωπος, τίς ἔσται ἀριθμὸς αὐτόιππος;	Now if number only goes up to 10, as some hold, in the first place the Forms will soon run short. For example, if 3 is the Idea of Man, what number will be the Idea of Horse?
ἅπασαι γὰρ αἱ πανηγύρεις οὐδὲν μέρος τιθέασιν τούτων τῶν ἄθλων, περὶ ὧν ὑμεῖς καθ’ ἑκάστην τὴν ἡμέραν ἀγωνίζεσθε.	for not all the public festivals in the world offer a prize comparable to those for which you who are kings strive every day of your lives.
τίς οὖν ἐλπὶς ὑπὸ τούτου τι ἀγαθὸν πείσεσθαι τὴν πόλιν, ὃν ὑμεῖς, ὅτι μὲν οὐδενὸς ἄξιός ἐστιν, ἐπειδὰν ἀπολογῆται, εἴσεσθε, ὅτι δὲ πονηρός ἐστιν ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιτηδευμάτων ἤσθησθε;	Well, what hope is there that the city will derive any benefit from this man, whom you will know for the worthless wretch he is, when he makes his defence, and whose villainy you have learnt from the general tenor of his life?
ταῦτα γὰρ νῦν μάλιστα κατεπείγει τὸν βασιλέα.	for these now most interest the king.
ἐρρήθη γάρ που οὕτως ἡμῶν εἶναι ἡ ψυχὴ καὶ πρὶν εἰς σῶμα ἀφικέσθαι, ὥσπερ αὐτῆς ἐστιν ἡ οὐσία ἔχουσα τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν τὴν τοῦ ὃ ἔστιν ἐγὼ δὲ ταύτην, ὡς ἐμαυτὸν πείθω, ἱκανῶς τε καὶ ὀρθῶς ἀποδέδεγμαι.	For we agreed that our soul before it entered into the body existed just as the very essence which is called the absolute exists. Now I am persuaded that I have accepted this essence on sufficient and right grounds.
Οὐ γὰρ ἄλλα γράφομεν ὑμῖν, ἀλλ' ἢ ἃ ἀναγινώσκετε ἢ καὶ ἐπιγινώσκετε, ἐλπίζω δὲ ὅτι καὶ ἕως τέλους ἐπιγνώσεσθε·	Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
διὰ τοῦτο παραγγέλλουσιν οἱ φιλόσοφοι μὴ ἀρκεῖσθαι μόνῳ τῷ μαθεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ μελέτην προσλαμβάνειν, εἶτα ἄσκησιν.	For this reason, philosophers advise us not to be contented with mere learning, but to add meditation likewise, and then practice.
ἔνθα θνήσκει μὲν Ἴδμων ὁ μάντις πλήξαντος αὐτὸν κάπρου, θνήσκει δὲ καὶ Τῖφυς, καὶ τὴν ναῦν Ἀγκαῖος ὑπισχνεῖται κυβερνᾶν.	There died Idmon the seer of a wound inflicted by a boar and there too died Tiphys, and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.
Κερκυραῖοι δὲ αἰσθόμενοι τάς τε Ἀττικὰς ναῦς προσπλεούσας τάς τε τῶν πολεμίων οἰχομένας, λαβόντες τούς τε Μεσσηνίους ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἤγαγον πρότερον ἔξω ὄντας, καὶ τὰς ναῦς περιπλεῦσαι κελεύσαντες ἃς ἐπλήρωσαν ἐς τὸν Ὑλλαϊκὸν λιμένα, ἐν ὅσῳ περιεκομίζοντο, τῶν ἐχθρῶν εἴ τινα λάβοιεν, ἀπέκτεινον·	But the people of Corcyra, hearing of the Attic galleys coming in and the going off of the Peloponnesians, brought into the city those Messenians which before were without and appointing the galleys which they had furnished to come about into the Hillaique haven, whilst accordingly they went about, slew all the contrary faction they could lay hands on, and also afterwards threw overboard out of the same galleys all those they had before persuaded to embark, and so went thence.
ἦν γὰρ ἡ πρὸ τοῦ σαββάτου δίκη, δι᾽ ἣν αἰτίαν οὐκ ἐμακροτόνησαν κατατρέχοντες αὐτούς.	For it was the justice before the Sabbath. ⌊This is why⌋ they did not continue pursuing them.
ὑπὲρ ὧν δ’ ἔπαθεν ἐκεῖνος, μέχρι τούτου σχετλιάζων περιῄει καὶ φάσκων εἰς Ἄρειον πάγον Δημοχάρην προσκαλεῖσθαι, ἕως διελύσατο πρὸς τοὺς τὴν αἰτίαν ἔχοντας.	He went around bewailing his brother’s fate and declaring that he was going to summon Demochares before the Areopagus, until he made terms with those charged with the crime.
καλὸν δὲ καὶ ἔνια τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων μηδ’ εἰδέναι δοκεῖν, ἀλλὰ τὸ τοῦ γήρως ἀμβλυῶττον καὶ δύσκωφον ἐπὶ τὰ γιγνόμενα μεταφέρειν, ὡς ἔνια τῶν πραττομένων ὁρῶντας μὴ ὁρᾶν καὶ μὴ ἀκούειν ἀκούοντας.	It is good also not to discover the notice they take of divers faults, and to transfer to such cases that dimness of sight and hardness of hearing that are wont to accompany old age so as sometimes not to hear what they hear, nor to see what they see, of their children’s miscarriages.
τῆσδε μὲν οὖν τῆς ἐλπίδος ὁ Ξάνθιππος οὐκ ἀπέτυχεν·	The expectations of Xanthippus were not disappointed.
καὶ κατὰ τάχος ἀναστήσας ἦγε τὸν στρατόν ἤδη γὰρ καὶ τῆς ἡμέρας ὀψὲ ἦν, καὶ ἐπειδὴ προσέμειξεν ἐγγὺς τοῦ στρατεύματος αὐτῶν, ἐς χωρίον καθίσας ὅθεν λόφου ὄντος μεταξὺ οὐκ ἐθεώρουν ἀλλήλους, ἔτασσέ τε καὶ παρεσκευάζετο ὡς ἐς μάχην.	And when he was near to their army, in a place from whence by the interposition of a hill they saw not each other, making a stand he put his army into order and prepared to give battle.
ἐν τῷ λέγειν καινὴν πεπαλαίωκεν τὴν πρώτην· τὸ δὲ παλαιούμενον καὶ γηράσκον ἐγγὺς ἀφανισμοῦ.¶	When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.
καὶ τρὶς δράσαντας τοῦτο, τεκμήριά τε καὶ μάρτυρας ἱκανῶς παραλαβόντας, ψῆφον ἱερὰν ἕκαστον φέροντα καὶ ὑποσχόμενον πρὸς τῆς ἑστίας εἰς δύναμιν τὰ δίκαια καὶ ἀληθῆ κρίνειν, οὕτω τέλος ἐπιθεῖναι τῇ τοιαύτῃ δίκῃ.	And after doing this thrice,—during which proceedings they shall pay full attention to evidence and witnesses,—each of the judges shall cast a sacred vote, promising by Hestia to give just and true judgment to the best of his power and thus they shall bring to its end this form of trial.
Διὰ τοῦτο, ἐὰν ἔλθω, ὑπομνήσω αὐτοῦ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιεῖ, λόγοις πονηροῖς φλυαρῶν ἡμᾶς· καὶ μὴ ἀρκούμενος ἐπὶ τούτοις, οὔτε αὐτὸς ἐπιδέχεται τοὺς ἀδελφούς, καὶ τοὺς βουλομένους κωλύει, καὶ ἐκ τῆς ἐκκλησίας ἐκβάλλει.	Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.
Ῥωμαῖοι γὰρ ἅμα τῆς θαλάττης ἥψαντο καὶ τῶν κατὰ Σαρδόνα πραγμάτων εὐθέως ἀντείχοντο.	This came about because the first thing the Romans did upon getting a navy was to try to become masters of Sardinia.
τὸ γὰρ κινητικὸν καὶ τὸ κινητὸν ἐνδεῖν αὐτῷ.	for it neither has the power to move, neither can it be moved.
ἐθαυμάζετο δὲ καὶ Ξενοφῶν ὁ θαυματοποιός, ὃς μαθητὴν κατέλιπε Κρατισθένη τὸν Φλιάσιον·	Xenophon the conjuror, too, was very popular among them, who left behind him a pupil of the name of Cratisthenes, a citizen of Phlias
ἆρα ἐννοοῦμεν ὡς ταῖς πρῶτον οὕτω καταζευγνυμέναις πόλεσιν ἀνάγκη μὲν εἶναί τινας, οἵτινες δὲ εἶεν ἂν πρὸς πασῶν τῶν ἀρχῶν γεγονότες, οὐκ ἔστιν;	We perceive (do we not?) that for States that are thus getting into harness for the first time some such persons there must necessarily be but who they can be, before any officials exist, it is impossible to see.
υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥουβήν· Ἑνὼχ καὶ Φαλλούδ, Ἁσρὼν καὶ Χαρμί.	The sons of Reuben were Enoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
ὡς δὴ σημείῳ τῆς εὐπαθείας χαίρουσι τῇ τιμᾖ·	so they enjoy being honored by him as a token of benefits to come.
ἀλλὰ δευρὶ κατακλινεὶς προσμάνθανε ξυμποτικὸς εἶναι καὶ ξυνουσιαστικός.	now recline there, and practise the bearing that is fitting at table in society.
ἔτεκον ἀνάσχου ταῦτ’ ἐμοῦ κλύων, γέρον.	I bore a child hear me patiently, old friend.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἀπὸ Φαίδωνος, ὧν τοὺς κορυφαιοτάτους Ἐρετρικούς.	Not but what we shall notice further the pupils of Phaedo, the chief of whom were called the school of Eretria.
αὗται γὰρ εἰσιν αἱ λεγόμεναι τῆς διαστάσεως εὐπρεπέσταται προφάσεις, τῇ δὲ Τερεντίᾳ καὶ ταύτας ἀρνουμένῃ λαμπρὰν ἐποίησε τὴν ἀπολογίαν αὐτὸς ἐκεῖνος μετ’ οὐ πολὺν χρόνον γήμας παρθένον, ὡς μὲν ἡ Τερεντία κατεφήμιζεν, ἔρωτι τῆς ὥρας, ὡς δὲ Τίρων ὁ τοῦ Κικέρωνος ἀπελεύθερος γέγραφεν, εὐπορίας ἕνεκεν πρὸς διάλυσιν δανείων.	These, indeed, are the most plausible reasons given for the divorce. Terentia, however, denied that these were the reasons, and Cicero himself made her defence a telling one by marrying shortly afterwards a maiden. This he did, as Terentia asserted, out of love for her youthful beauty but as Tiro, Cicero’s freedman, has written, to get means for the payment of his debts.
ἀλλὰ γάρ, ὦ ἄνδρες, καθήμενος ἡνίκα μου κατηγόρει, βλέπων εἰς αὐτὸν οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ ὑπὸ τῶν τριάκοντα συνειλημμένος ἔδοξα κρίνεσθαι.	Really, gentlemen, as I sat watching him make his speech for the prosecution, I quite thought that I had been arrested and put on trial by the Thirty.
ἵστανται μὲν οὖν ἐν τρισὶ ποσὶ μετὰ τῶν ὅπλων καὶ Ῥωμαῖοι·	Now, a Roman soldier in full armour also requires a space of three square feet.
Φησὶ δὲ Σάτυρος ἐν τοῖς Βίοις ὅτι καὶ ἰατρὸς ἦν καὶ ῥήτωρ ἄριστος.	Satyrus in his Lives says that he was also a physician and an excellent orator
γενόμενοι δὲ τοιοῦτοι πρὸς τὰς ἐπῳδοὺς καὶ ἐμμέτρους μάλιστα φωνὰς ἐκφέρονται.	and, when in that condition, they naturally slide down to songs and words in measure
οὐκ ἄρα, ὦ Ἱππία, τὸ δυνατόν τε καὶ τὸ χρήσιμον ἡμῖν, ὡς ἔοικεν, ἐστὶ τὸ καλόν.	Then, Hippias, the powerful and the useful are not, as it seems, our beautiful.
καὶ ἐκφυσήσω ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἐν πυρὶ ὀργῆς μου, καὶ χωνευθήσεσθε ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς.	And I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and you will be smelted in the midst of it.
Νικήσας δὲ Σαοῦλος ἅπαντας τοὺς ἀπὸ Πηλουσίου τῆς Αἰγύπτου καθήκοντας ἕως τῆς Ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάσσης διέφθειρε πολεμίους παραλιπὼν τὸ τῶν Σικιμιτῶν ἔθνος·	But when Saul had conquered all these Amalekites that reached from Pelusium of Egypt to the Red Sea, he laid waste all the rest of the enemy's country
ὅπερ οἶμαι καὶ ταύτας ποιήσειν, ἢν μὴ σὺ πρότερον αὐτῶν ἐπιμεληθῇς.	And that is just what I think these states also will do unless you first take them in hand.
κλᾶται γὰρ περὶ τὰς τῶν κρημνῶν ἐξοχὰς καὶ πολλάκις εἰς αὑτὴν ἀνατρέχουσα καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν αὖθις ἐκμηκυνομένη μόλις ψαύει τοῦ πρόσω.	for it is broken off at the prominent precipices of the rock, and returns frequently into itself, and lengthening again by little and little, hath much ado to proceed forward
σὺ δ’ οὖν δίωκε καὶ πόνον πλείω τίθου.	Pursue him then and get more trouble for yourself.
διὰ δὲ τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος Ἀχέρων ποταμὸς ῥέων ἐσβάλλει ἐς αὐτήν, ἀφ’ οὗ καὶ τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχει.	It gets its name from the river Acheron, which flows through Thesprotis, and falls into the lake.
ἀρχὴ τῶν ἕνδεκα καθέστηκε.	You have the authority of the Eleven.
τὸ γὰρ σύνθημα κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ ὑπὸ τῶν στρατηγούντων ἐδίδοτο ἐν ταῖς μάχαις Θεσσαλοῖς μὲν Ἀθηνᾶς Ἰτωνίας, τοῖς δὲ ὁ ἐπώνυμος Φῶκος.	For the watchword given in battle on every occasion by the Thessalian generals was Itonian Athena, and by the Phocian generals Phocus, from whom the Phocians were named.
ἐξεδέχετο γὰρ ἡ γῆ τὸ ἀπὸ τῆς ἐσχάρας πῦρ καταφερόμενον τῆς βάσεως διὰ παντὸς οὐχ ὑποκειμένης.	for the ground underneath received the fire from the hearth, because it had no basis to receive it.
ταῦτα δ’ οὐ μόνον παρὰ τῶν Πυθαγορείων ἀκούειν ἐστὶ λεγόντων, ἀλλὰ καὶ Ἀριστόξενος οὕτως ἀποφαίνεται.	It is not only among the Pythagoreans that one hears this claim supported, for Aristoxenus is of that opinion, and Homer too regarded the bards as amongst the wisest of mankind.
ὑμεῖς οὖν ἐπιδείξατε πῶς τε ὁ χοῖρος ἐσφάγη καὶ πῶς ἐξ ἡμισείας μέν ἐστιν ὀπτός, ἑφθὸς δὲ κατὰ θάτερα.	Do you, therefore, show me now how this pig was killed, and how I contrived to roast half of him and to boil the other side.
οὐκοῦν τὴν μὲν σοφίαν ἀληθῆ διάνοιαν ἡγοῦνται, τὴν δὲ ἀμαθίαν ψευδῆ δόξαν;	And therefore they think that wisdom is true thinking and ignorance false opinion, do they not?
περὶ τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ σχεδόν ἐστι καὶ ἡ τῆς ἀλαζονείας καὶ εἰρωνείας μεσότης·	The observance of the mean in relation to Boastfulness has to do with almost the same things.
τὸ δὲ ἔργον ἑαυτοῦ δοκιμαζέτω ἕκαστος, καὶ τότε εἰς ἑαυτὸν μόνον τὸ καύχημα ἕξει, καὶ οὐκ εἰς τὸν ἕτερον.	But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
πρέσβεις οὖν ἐς Πομπήιον πέμψας ἠξίου μαθεῖν, τίς ἂν εἴη τοῦ πολέμου διάλυσις.	Mithridates sent envoys to Pompey asking on what terms he could obtain peace.
καὶ τὸ δίψος ἐπέτεινεν ὁ ἀγών·	Besides, their contest intensified their thirst
ἐνθυμήθητε τοίνυν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, οἷοί τινες ὄντες πολῖται καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ ὧν προσήκοντες ἀδικούμενοι ἀξιοῦμεν ἐλεεῖσθαι ὑφ’ ὑμῶν καὶ τῶν δικαίων τυγχάνειν·	Now you must reflect, gentlemen of the jury, on the character that we bear as citizens ourselves, and also on the family of which we come, when we claim your pity for the wrongs that we have suffered and an award of our rights.
ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνός μοι φαγεῖν παρετίθει.	But he used to set my dinner before me.
ἐταπεινώθην ἕως σφόδρα· Κύριε, ζῆσόν με κατὰ τὸ λόγιόν σου.	I was humbled exceedingly, O Lord. Make me alive according to your word.
ἔνθα δὴ ἐγὼ ἀντέτρεφον ἐκεῖνον, ἕως ἔζη, αὐτὸς σκάπτων καὶ σπείρων καὶ μάλα μικρὸν γῄδιον, οὐ μέντοι πονηρόν γε, ἀλλὰ πάντων δικαιότατον·	And there, as long as he lived, I, in turn, supported him by digging and planting a very little plot of ground. It was really not such a very bad plot of ground, but, on the contrary, the most honest
ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ κοιμηθήσομαι καὶ ὑπνώσω· ὅτι σύ, Κύριε, κατὰ μόνας ἐπὶ ἐλπίδι κατῴκισάς με.	In complete peace I will go to bed and fall asleep, because you alone, O Lord, ⌊settle⌋ me in hope.
ἡ γὰρ ὑγρὰ φύσις ἀρχὴ καὶ γένεσις οὖσα πάντων ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὰ πρῶτα τρία σώματα, γῆν ἀέρα καὶ πῦρ, ἐποίησε.	For the humid nature, being in the beginning the chief source and origin of the universe, must of consequence produce the three first bodies, — the earth, air, and fire.
Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθετε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συλλαβεῖν με;	Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me?
ἐοικότα μὲν δὴ Χάρισιν ὀνόματα καὶ ταῦτα, ἐοικότα δὲ καὶ παρ’ Ἀθηναίοις· τιμῶσι γὰρ ἐκ παλαιοῦ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι Χάριτας Αὐξὼ καὶ Ἡγεμόνην.	These are appropriate names for Graces, as are those given by the Athenians, who from of old have worshipped two Graces, Auxo and Hegemone.
οἱ δὲ Καρχηδόνιοι πυθόμενοι σῖτον πολὺν ἐς ἐμπόριόν τι ὑπὸ Ἀννίβου σεσωρεῦσθαι, ὁλκάδας ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἐξέπεμπον καὶ ναῦς μακράς, ἐγνωκότες, εἰ τὸν σῖτον λάβοιεν, ἐκστρατεῦσαι καὶ ὑπομεῖναι πᾶν ὅ τι ἂν ἡ τύχη κρίνῃ, μᾶλλον ἢ Ῥωμαίοις δουλεύειν ἑκόντες.	The remaining Carthaginians, hearing that a large quantity of provisions had been stored by Hannibal at a certain place, sent a number of transports and war-ships thither, being resolved, if they could obtain food, to continue the war and to endure everything rather than accept servitude to the Romans.
καὶ τούτων ἡμεῖς οὐδὲν λέγομεν ὅ τι οὐ καὶ ἐν τῷ τῶν Ὀλυνθίων δήμῳ μυριόλεκτόν ἐστι.	And there is not one of these things which we say which is not also said thousands of times among the people of Olynthus.
Τετάρτῃ δὲ Πανέμου μηνὸς ἀναζεύξας εἰς Πτολεμαίδα κἀκεῖθεν εἰς τὴν παράλιον ἀφικνεῖται Καισάρειαν, μεγίστην τῆς τε Ἰουδαίας πόλιν καὶ τὸ πλέον ὑφ' Ἑλλήνων οἰκουμένην.	Vespasian returned to Ptolemais on the fourth day of the month Panemus, and proceeded from there to Caesarea, a great city of Judea, inhabited for the most part by Greeks.
μισεῖν σε φήσεις τήνδε καὶ τὸ δὴ νόθον τοῖς γνησίοισι πολέμιον πεφυκέναι·	Thou wilt assert she hated thee, that ’twixt the bastard and the true-born child nature has herself put war
ἣ Βακχίδος μὲν ἦν δούλη τῆς αὐλητρίδος, ἐκείνη δὲ Σινώπης τῆς Θρᾴττης τῆς ἐξ Αἰγίνης Ἀθήναζε μετενεγκαμένης τὴν πορνείαν·	who was originally the slave of Bacchis, the female flute-player. And Bacchis herself had been the slave of Sinope the Thracian, who brought her establishment of harlots from Aegina to Athens
τὸ δ’ ὡς ἀληθὲς ὂν καὶ κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς τὸ μέν ἐστιν ἐν συμπλοκῇ διανοίας καὶ πάθος ἐν ταύτῃ διὸ περὶ μὲν τὸ οὕτως ὂν οὐ ζητοῦνται αἱ ἀρχαί, περὶ δὲ τὸ ἔξω ὂν καὶ χωριστόν· τὸ δ’ οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον ἀλλ’ ἀόριστον, λέγω δὲ τὸ κατὰ συμβεβηκός·	As for "what is" in the sense of what is true or what is accidental , the former depends upon a combination in thought, and is an affection of thought (hence we do not look for the principles of Being in this sense, but only for those of objective and separable Being) the latter is not necessary but indeterminate (I mean the accidental)
τέλος δὲ ὡς ἧκέ τις ἀπαγγέλλων ἀπὸ θαλάσσης, νέοι προσπίπτοντες αὐτῷ φόβοι, τὰ μὲν δέει τοῦ μέλλοντος, τὰ δὲ ὥσπερ ἄχθει καὶ κόρῳ τῶν παρόντων, ῥοπῆς βραχείας ἐπιγενομένης εἰς νόσον κατηνέχθη πλευρῖτιν, ὡς ἱστορεῖ Ποσειδώνιος ὁ φιλόσοφος, αὐτὸς εἰσελθεῖν καὶ διαλεχθῆναι περὶ ὧν ἐπρέσβευεν ἤδη νοσοῦντι φάσκων αὐτῷ.	And finally, when one came with tidings from the sea, fresh terrors fell upon him, partly because he feared the future, and partly because he was wearied to satiety by the present, so that it needed only a slight impulse to throw him into a pleurisy, as Poseidonius the philosopher relates, who says that he went in personally and conversed with Marius on the subjects of his embassy after Marius had fallen ill.
καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς πολλῷ χαλεπώτερα πάσχων ὑπὸ τἀδελφοῦ τῆς ἀμύνης ἐπίπροσθεν τίθεσθαι τὸ τῆς φύσεως δίκαιον:	for instance, when he had suffered even greater harms from his own brother, he had put the duty of nature before the passion of revenge.
εἰ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἀγοραίοις οἰκήσεις τε καὶ πωλητήρια κατασκευασθείη καὶ ἐν Πειραιεῖ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἄστει, ἅμα τ’ ἂν κόσμος εἴη τῇ πόλει καὶ πολλαὶ ἂν ἀπὸ τούτων πρόσοδοι γίγνοιντο.	Again, if houses and shops were put up both in the Peiraeus and in the city for retail traders, they would be an ornament to the state, and at the same time the source of a considerable revenue.
ξένος δὲ κλήρους ἐπινωμᾷ, Χάλυβος Σκυθᾶν ἄποικος, κτεάνων χρηματοδαίτας πικρός, ὠμόφρων σίδαρος, χθόνα ναίειν διαπήλας, ὁπόσαν καὶ φθιμένοισιν κατέχειν, τῶν μεγάλων πεδίων ἀμοίρους.	A stranger distributes their inheritance, a Chalybian immigrant from Scythia, a bitter divider of wealth, savage-hearted iron that apportions land for them to dwell in, as much as they can occupy in death when they have lost their share in these wide plains.
ἀπορουμένου δ' αὐτοῦ καὶ πεπλανῆσθαι λέγοντος αἵ τε συνθῆκαι τῶν δανείων ἀνεγινώσκοντο καὶ τὰ τῶν ἡγεμόνων γράμματα πόλεις τε ὅσαι τὰ λῃστήρια κατῃτιῶντο,	The deeds about the money he had borrowed were also read, and the letters of the officers of Syria and the complaints of the various cities that had been harmed by the brigands.

The Lord says, the one stretching out heaven and laying the foundation of the earth and forming the breath of a person in him,
μέγα σοι ἀγαθὸν ἔσται σωθέντι τοιούτῳ καὶ λύχνων ἄξιον.	It will be a great thing for you if you do return safe, and it will be worth while to burn lights for such a person

ἔστι τοίνυν τις εὐήθης λόγος παρὰ τῶν παραμυθεῖσθαι βουλομένων τὴν πόλιν, ὡς ἄρ’ οὔπω Φίλιππός ἐστιν οἷοί ποτ’ ἦσαν Λακεδαιμόνιοι, οἳ θαλάττης μὲν ἦρχον καὶ γῆς ἁπάσης, βασιλέα δὲ σύμμαχον εἶχον, ὑφίστατο δ’ οὐδὲν αὐτούς·	Now there is a foolish argument advanced by those who want to reassure the citizens.

ὧν ἐν τῷ παρόντι προκεχειρίσμεθά σοι τὸν Τιμολέοντος τοῦ Κορινθίου καὶ τὸν Αἰμιλίου Παύλου βίον,	Among these were Timoleon the Corinthian and Aemilius Paulus, whose Lives I have now undertaken to lay before my readers
καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πιστὸς ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ διδοὺς πεῖραν οὐδενὸς ἧττον ἐδόκει πραγμάτων ἔμπειρος εἶναι·	In other ways he was trusted by Galba, and when put to the test was thought to be inferior to none as a man of affairs
οὐκ εὔκριτον τὸ κρῖμα. μή μ’ αἱροῦ κριτήν.	The judgment is not easy—do not make me the judge.
λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ περισσεύσῃ ὑμῶν ἡ δικαιοσύνη πλεῖον τῶν γραμματέων καὶ Φαρισαίων, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν.¶	For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
διὸ καλῶς ἔλεγεν ὁ Βορυσθενίτης Βίων οὐ δεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τὰς ἡδονὰς πορίζεσθαι, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ φρονεῖν.	On which account, Bion of the Borysthenes said, cleverly enough, that A man ought not to derive his pleasures from the table, but from meditation
πῶς γὰρ ἔσται τάξις μή τινος ὄντος ἀϊδίου καὶ χωριστοῦ καὶ μένοντος;	For how can there be any order in the universe if there is not something eternal and separate and permanent?
σὺ δέ, ὃς τῶν ἐπὶ πᾶσιν ἄρχεις, τελευταίους ἔχων τοὺς ἄνδρας παράγγελλε τοῖς σαυτοῦ ἐφορᾶν τε ἑκάστῳ τοὺς καθ’ αὑτὸν καὶ τοῖς μὲν τὸ δέον ποιοῦσιν ἐπικελεύειν, τοῖς δὲ μαλακυνομένοις ἀπειλεῖν ἰσχυρῶς· ἢν δέ τις στρέφηται προδιδόναι θέλων, θανάτῳ ζημιοῦν.	Now you, the commander of the rear-guard, as you are behind all the rest with your men, issue orders to your own division that each man watch those immediately in front of him, encourage those who are doing their duty, threaten violently those who lag behind, and punish with death any one who turns his back with traitorous intent.
Οἱ δὲ βάρβαροι παρεῖχον οὐ τὴν τυχοῦσαν φιλανθρωπίαν ἡμῖν· ἀνάψαντες γὰρ πυράν, προσελάβοντο πάντας ἡμᾶς, διὰ τὸν ὑετὸν τὸν ἐφεστῶτα, καὶ διὰ τὸ ψύχος.	And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.
τὰ μὲν οὖν ἤδη περὶ αὐτῶν εἴρηται, πρὸς δ’ ἐκείνοις ἔτι τάδε, ἐν μὲν ὁμαλότητι μηδέποτε ἐθέλειν κίνησιν ἐνεῖναι.	The facts about them have already been stated in part but in addition thereto we must state further that motion never consents to exist within uniformity.
καὶ τελεσθέντος αὐτῷ ταχέως τοῦ προστάγματος τοὺς νεκροὺς εἰς Ἀλεξάνδρειον ἐκέλευσεν ἀνακομισθῆναι τὸ φρούριον συνταφησομένους Ἀλεξάνδρῳ τῷ μητροπάτορι.	When this was quickly done he ordered to have their corpses brought to the fortress of Alexandreion, to be buried with Alexander, their maternal grandfather.
ἔστιν ἄρα ταὐτόν, ὡς ἔοικε, βασιλεύς, τύραννος, πολιτικός, οἰκονόμος, δεσπότης, σώφρων, δίκαιος.	Hence they are all the same, it seems,—king, despot, statesman, house-manager, master, and the temperate man and the just man
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοὺς μὲν πλείστους τῶν Ἀλλοβρίγων ἀπέκτεινε, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς τρεψάμενος ἠνάγκασε φυγεῖν εἰς τὴν οἰκείαν, τότε δὴ τὸ μὲν ἔτι περιλειπόμενον πλῆθος τῶν ὑποζυγίων καὶ τῶν ἵππων μόλις καὶ ταλαιπώρως διήνυε τὰς δυσχωρίας, αὐτὸς δὲ συναθροίσας ὅσους ἠδύνατο πλείστους ἐκ τοῦ κινδύνου προσέβαλε πρὸς τὴν πόλιν, ἐξ ἧς ἐποιήσαντο τὴν ὁρμὴν οἱ πολέμιοι.	and it was not until he had killed the greater number of the Allobroges, and forced the rest to fly to their own land, that the remainder of the beasts of burden and the horses got slowly, and with difficulty, over the dangerous ground. Hannibal himself rallied as many as he could after the fight, and assaulted the town from which the enemy had sallied
μὴ γάρ τι οἴου λίθους μὲν εἶναι ἱεροὺς καὶ ξύλα καὶ ὄρνεα καὶ ὄφεις, ἀνθρώπους δὲ μή·	For you must not suppose that while stocks and stones and birds and snakes are sacred, men are not
φέρε δὴ τὸ δαλίον τόδ᾽ ἐμβάψω λαβών, σείου σὺ ταχέως· σὺ δὲ πρότεινε τῶν ὀλῶν, καὐτός γε χερνίπτου παραδοὺς ταύτην ἐμοί, καὶ τοῖς θεαταῖς ῥῖπτε τῶν κριθῶν.	wait. i take this fire - brand first and plunge it into the water. now quick, quick, you sprinkle the altar. give me some barley - seed, purify yourself and hand me the basin; then scatter the rest of the barley among the audience. done. you have thrown it?
ἂν νῦν ἀμελήσῃς καὶ ῥᾳθυμήσῃς καὶ ἀεὶ προθέσεις ἐκ προθέσεως ποιῇ καὶ ἡμέρας ἄλλας ἐπ’ ἄλλαις ὁρίζῃς, μεθ’ ἃς προσέξεις σεαυτῷ, λήσεις σεαυτὸν οὐ προκόψας, ἀλλ’ ἰδιώτης διατελέσεις καὶ ζῶν καὶ ἀποθνῄσκων.	If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing, and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind.
τῆς ὀρχήσεως δὲ ἄλλη μὲν Μούσης λέξιν μιμουμένων, τό τε μεγαλοπρεπὲς φυλάττοντας ἅμα καὶ ἐλεύθερον, ἄλλη δέ, εὐεξίας ἐλαφρότητός τε ἕνεκα καὶ κάλλους, τῶν τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ μελῶν καὶ μερῶν τὸ προσῆκον καμπῆς τε καὶ ἐκτάσεως, καὶ ἀποδιδομένης ἑκάστοις αὐτοῖς αὑτῶν εὐρύθμου κινήσεως, διασπειρομένης ἅμα καὶ συνακολουθούσης εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν ὄρχησιν ἱκανῶς.	Of dancing there is one branch in which the style of the Muse is imitated, preserving both freedom and nobility, and another which aims at physical soundness, agility and beauty by securing for the various parts and members of the body the proper degree of flexibility and extension and bestowing also the rhythmical motion which belongs to each, and which accompanies the whole of dancing and is diffused throughout it completely.
οἱ δὲ Θηβαῖοι οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ ἐπὶ πεντήκοντα ἀσπίδων συνεστραμμένοι ἦσαν, λογιζόμενοι ὡς εἰ νικήσειαν τὸ περὶ τὸν βασιλέα, τὸ ἄλλο πᾶν εὐχείρωτον ἔσοιτο.	The Thebans, however, were massed not less than fifty shields deep, calculating that if they conquered that part of the army which was around the king, all the rest of it would be easy to overcome.
οὐδὲ μὴν ὅν γε σοφὸν ἡμεῖς νυνδὴ προυθέμεθα, τὸν τὰς ἡδονὰς καὶ λύπας κεκτημένον συμφώνους τοῖς ὀρθοῖς λόγοις καὶ ἑπομένας.	Nor is he whom we recently proposed as our type of wisdom,—the man who has his feelings of pleasure and pain in accord with the dictates of right reason and obedient thereto.
ἁρπάσαντα Σύμην τὴν Ἰηλύσου καὶ Δωτίδος θυγατέρα ἀποπλεῦσαι εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν καὶ τὴν ἐγγὺς τῆς Καρίας νῆσον ἔρημον κατοικίσαντα ἀπὸ τῆς γυναικὸς Σύμην αὐτὴν προσαγορεῦσαι.	and that having ravished Syme, the daughter of Ialemus and Dotis, he sailed away to Asia, and colonised a desert island near Caria, and called that Syme, from the name of his wife.
ἔλαθε γὰρ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ὑπολειφθεὶς ὁ Σωκράτης, ὁ δὲ προεισῆλθεν, ἀτεχνῶς σκιὰ προβαδίζουσα σώματος ἐξόπισθεν τὸ φῶς ἔχοντος.	For Socrates by accident staying somewhat behind, Aristodemus went in first and this seemed very fitting, for, the sun shining on their backs, the shadow ought to go before the body.
μὴ βίβλος ἢ γραμματεύς μοι παρέστηκεν, ἵνα ἄνθρωπον ἑστηκὼς κατασιωπήσω;	Has a book or scribe stood beside me, so that standing I might make a person to be silent?
αἰ δέ κα μὴ εἴκωντι τοὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐξ Ἐπιδαύρω, πολεμίως ἦμεν τοῖς Ἀργείοις καὶ τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ξυμμάχοις καὶ τοῖς τῶν Ἀργείων ξυμμάχοις.	"And if the Athenians depart not from Epidaurus [likewise], they shall be held as enemies both to the Argives and to the Lacedaemonians and also to the confederates of them both.
εἶτ’ ἂν μὲν τοιούτῳ προσπάθῃς, καὶ τοῦτο πάλιν κλαῖε καὶ ζήτει στίχον ὅμοιον τῷ Εὐριπίδου ποιῆσαι θερμάς τε τὰς Νέρωνος Μάρκιόν θ’ ὕδωρ.	Then if you become attached to this also, cry for this too, and try to make a verse like the verse of Euripides, The hot baths of Nero and the Marcian water.
τοῦ λοιποῦ μέντοι γε προνοεῖν τῆς πολιορκίας, ὅπως μηδὲν ἔτι πταίσωσι κατ' αὐτήν, ἀλλὰ χώμασι καὶ μηχαναῖς ἐκπολιορκήσαντας καὶ παραστησαμένους τὴν μὲν πόλιν κατασκάψαι, ἅπαντας δ' ἀπολέσαι τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ.	He should take care with the siege, so as to suffer no further losses in it, but raise bulwarks and use siege machines, and once the city was captured, to destroy its foundations and kill everyone in it
κράτιστον οὖν ἐξ ἁπάντων τούτων, περὶ ὧν τὸ τελευταῖόν με διέβαλλον ἀποφηνάμενον ἃ δοκεῖ μοι, τότ’ ἤδη λέγειν περὶ ὦν ἐξ ἀρχῆς διενοήθην·	The best course, therefore, that I can take under all these conditions is to set before you what I think about the last attempts to arouse prejudice against me and then proceed to speak on the subject which I had in mind from the first.
πῶς οὖν ἔτι οὐ δερόμενος βλάπτεται ἢ δεσμευόμενος ἢ ἀποκεφαλιζόμενος; οὐχὶ οὕτως μέν·	How then [is it a paradox to say] that, when he is whipped, or imprisoned, or beheaded, he is not hurt?
ἐν τούτῳ δέ εἰσι τῷ ὄρει καὶ αἱ πηγαὶ τοῦ Ἰνάχου·	On this mountain are also the springs of the river Inachus.
δόξετε γάρ, εἶπεν, μὴ πολλοῦ τὸ ἄρχειν ἄξιον ἢ μὴ πολλοὺς τοῦ ἄρχειν ἀξίους ἡγεῖσθαι.	For, said he, you will give the impression that you hold office to be of no great worth, or else that you hold not many men to be worthy of office.
ἐντυχόντες γραφῇ τινι εὕρομεν, ὡς ἐξ ἑνὸς εἶεν γένους Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ἐκ τῆς πρὸς Ἄβραμον οἰκειότητος. δίκαιον οὖν ἐστιν ἀδελφοὺς ὑμᾶς ὄντας διαπέμπεσθαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς περὶ ὧν ἂν βούλησθε.	We have met with a certain writing, whereby we have discovered that both the Jews and the Lacedemonians are of one stock, and are derived from the kindred of Abraham It is but just therefore that you, who are our brethren, should send to us about any of your concerns as you please.
ὃ γίνεται κατὰ μέρη τινὰ ἤτοι ἔξωθεν βιασαμένου τινὸς ῥεύματος ἢ τῆς θερμασίας ἐπιτηδείων πόρων ἐπιλαμβανομένης εἰς τὸ τοῦτο ἀπεργάσασθαι.	And this happens at certain parts either because a current has forced its way in from without or because the heat has gained possession of certain passages in order to effect this.
τὰ σημεῖα ἡμῶν οὐκ εἴδομεν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι προφήτης, καὶ ἡμᾶς οὐ γνώσεται ἔτι.	We do not see our signs; there is no longer a prophet, and he will know us no longer.
ἐὰν γὰρ ταῦτα γένηται, τὰ μὲν ἐπιτήδεια πλείω ἕξουσιν ὁπότεροι ἂν πλείω δύνωνται λαβόντες ἀποτίθεσθαι, πολιορκήσονται δὲ ὁπότεροι ἂν ἥττους ὦσι.	For, if this is done, that side will have more provisions which is able to get and store up more, and those will be in a state of siege who are weaker.
ἄρισθ’ ὑπέλαβές τε καὶ οὕτω δὴ ποίει.	You have grasped my meaning excellently please do so.
δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι οὐ τοῦτο λέγει, ὅπερ ἄρτι ἐλέγομεν, τό τινος παρακαταθεμένου τι ὁτῳοῦν μὴ σωφρόνως ἀπαιτοῦντι ἀποδιδόναι.	Obviously he does not mean what we were just speaking of, this return of a deposit to anyone whatsoever even if he asks it back when not in his right mind.
ὡς παρασχὸν μὲν κατορθοῦν εἰς τὸ εὔδαιμον ἀνακειμένης τῆς κτήσεως, σφαλεῖσιν δὲ τοῦ ταύτης περιόντος ἀγαθοῦ τιμὴν καὶ κλέος ποιήσεσθαι τοῦ μεγαλόφρονος, καὶ τὸ θεῖον οὐκ ἄλλως ἢ ἐπὶ συμπράξει τῶν βουλευμάτων εἰς τὸ κατορθοῦν συμπροθυμεῖσθαι μᾶλλον, ἂν μεγάλων ἐρασταὶ τῇ διανοίᾳ καθιστάμενοι μὴ ἐξαφίωνται πόνου τοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς.	as if they could procure them happiness and security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a still greater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would thereby acquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not otherwise be assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils as might be successful, and for their own advantage and this especially, if they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing the same
κοινωνεῖν δὲ καὶ αὑτὸν τῆς νεὼς Ὑβλησίῳ, καὶ συμπλεῖν ἑαυτοῦ οἰκέτας ἐν τῇ νηί, καὶ ὅτε διεφθάρη ἡ ναῦς, παρεῖναι τοὺς οἰκέτας τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἀπαγγέλλειν ἑαυτῷ, καὶ ὅτι ἡ ναῦς κενὴ διεφθάρη παραπλέουσα εἰς Θευδοσίαν ἐκ Παντικαπαίου.	that slaves of his own were passengers on the ship and that, when the ship was wrecked, his servants were present and reported the fact to him, and also the further fact that the ship, having no cargo, was wrecked while sailing along the coast to Theodosia from Panticapaeum.
‘εἰς τοσοῦτον δ’ ἀσωτίας ἐληλύθει καὶ Δημήτριος ὁ Δημητρίου τοῦ Φαληρέως ἀπόγονος, ὥς φησιν Ἡγήσανδρος , ὥστε Ἀρισταγόραν μὲν ἔχειν τὴν Κορινθίαν ἐρωμένην, ζῆν δὲ πολυτελῶς.	But Demetrius carried his extravagance to such a height, he, I mean, who was the descendant of Demetrius Phalereus, according to the account of Hegesander, that he had Aristagora the Corinthian for a mistress, and lived in a most expensive manner.
Ὅταν δὲ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν Κύριος ὁ θεὸς δίδωσιν ὑμῖν, καὶ καταφυτεύσετε πᾶν ξύλον βρώσιμον, καὶ περικαθαριεῖτε τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν αὐτοῦ· ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ τρία ἔτη ἔσται ὑμῖν ἀπερικάθαρτος, οὐ βρωθήσεται.	“ ‘And whenever you enter into the land that the Lord God is granting to you and you plant any edible fruit tree, then clean away its uncleanness; its fruit will be impure to you for three years; it will not be eaten.
οὐ γὰρ ἔχει ἦθος αὕτη ἡ ὄρχησις, διὸ οὐδὲ βραδύνει.	for this kind of dance gives no scope for a display of the passions, on which account also it is never slow.
καὶ ἀνδράποδα δὲ καὶ βοσκήματα πάμπολλα ἡλίσκετο ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν.	Furthermore, very many slaves and cattle were captured on the farms.
καὶ πάλαι γ’ ἂν ἦν ἀνήρ, εἰ μὴ τὸ τῆς πόρνης ὑπωρρώδει κακόν.	— Yea, and long had been a man, Had he not feared the mischief of his harlot-birth.
πεμφθεὶς δὲ περὶ τῆς εἰρήνης εἰς Λακεδαίμονα καὶ δόξας ἀδικεῖν ἔφυγε.	He was sent to Lacedaemon to negotiate a peace, but was suspected of wrongdoing and banished.
καὶ παρὰ τὴν αἰτίαν ταύτην ὅ τε πόλεμος ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον μῆκος προύβη καὶ ἀνηκέστων Ἰουδαίους συμφορῶν ἀναπλησθῆναι συνέπεσεν.	and that was the occasion that this war lasted so very long, and thereby the Jews were involved in such incurable calamities.
οὗ γὰρ ἄν τις ἄναξ ᾖ, καὶ Ἕκτωρ δήπου ἐστὶν τούτου·	for surely a man is holder of that of which he is lord
εἰ δὲ πυνθάνῃ, πῶς πράξεις, τοῦτο εἰπεῖν, ὅτι, εἰ μὲν ὀρθὰ δόγματα ἔχεις, καλῶς, εἰ δὲ φαῦλα, κακῶς. παντὶ γὰρ αἴτιον τοῦ πράσσειν τι δόγμα.	if you have right opinions (δόγματα), you will fare well if they are false, you will fare ill. For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion.
δηλώσεις δὲ καὶ σὺ διὰ ταχέων, εἰ τὴν αὐτὴν γνώμην ἔχεις ἡμῖν·	And you yourself will soon make it clear if you reciprocate my regard
σχολῇ γὰρ οὖν δή τις ἂν ἄλλο σκοπῶν, ἢ νόμους ἢ πολιτείας ἄλλας θεάσαιτο σῳζούσας καλὰ καὶ μεγάλα πράγματα ἢ καὶ τοὐναντίον διαφθειρούσας τὸ παράπαν, εἰ ἀμελήσειε τούτων.	Yes for, if one passed over these examples, one would not be likely to find elsewhere either laws or constitutions which preserve interests thus fair and great, or, on the contrary, wreck them totally.
τὸ δὲ τοὺς ἄλλως γενομένους ἀγαθοὺς κρίνειν κατ’ ἀρετὴν ἢ ἰσχὺν οὐδέν ἐστι· καὶ γὰρ τοὺς θεοὺς οἱ ἀγαθοὶ κρίνουσι κατ’ ἀρετὴν καὶ ἰσχύν·	Now to judge those who are otherwise made good according to virtue and strength is nothing to the purpose, for good men also judge the Gods according to virtue and strength
οὔκουν τό γε δίκαιόν φαμεν οὐδὲ καλόν, οὐδ’ οἷόν τε τὸν ζῶντα οὕτως ἀτυχῆσαι τοῦ προσήκοντος, προσήκει δὲ ἀργῷ καὶ ῥᾳθύμως καταπεπιασμένῳ ζῴῳ σχεδὸν ὑπ’ ἄλλου διαρπασθῆναι ζῴου τῶν σφόδρα τετρυχωμένων μετὰ ἀνδρείας τε ἅμα καὶ τῶν πόνων.	That, we assert, is neither right nor good nor is it possible for one who lives thus to miss his due reward and the due reward of an idle beast, fattened in sloth, is, as a rule, to fall a prey to another beast—one of those which are worn to skin and bone through toil hardily endured.
καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπον Ἰδοὺ οἱ δύο βασιλεῖς οὐκ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ πῶς στησόμεθα ἡμεῖς;	They were very frightened and said, “Look, two kings have not stood against his face. How will we stand?”
τὸ μὲν τάγηνον τευθίδων ἐφεστάναι σίζον·	that you hurry over devouring the fish to rush off to the assembly
καὶ νῦν οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ πλάσας με ἐκ κοιλίας δοῦλον ἑαυτῷ τοῦ συναγαγεῖν τὸν Ἰακὼβ πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ Ἰσραήλ Συναχθήσομαι καὶ δοξασθήσομαι ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἔσται μοι ἰσχύς.	And now this is what the Lord—who formed me from the womb ⌊as his servant⌋ in order to gather Jacob and Israel to himself—says: “I will be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and God will be strength for me.”
χαριζομένη δ' ἐκείνη τῇ μητρὶ πολλάκις ἔλεγεν, ὡς μέμνηνται μὲν ἰδιάζοντες ἐκεῖνοι τῆς Μαριάμμης, ἐστυγήκασι δὲ τὸν πατέρα, συνεχὲς δὲ διαπειλοῦσιν, εἰ τύχοιεν αὐτοί ποτε τῆς ἀρχῆς, τοὺς μὲν ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων γυναικῶν παῖδας Ἡρώδῃ γεγενημένους κωμογραμματεῖς καταστήσειν: ἁρμόσειν γὰρ εἰς τοιαύτην χρείαν τὸ νῦν ἐπιμελὲς αὐτῶν καὶ πρὸς παιδείαν ἐσπουδασμένον.	To gratify her, the girl told her mother that when they were alone they often spoke of Mariamne, and that they hated their father and often threatened that if they came to rule, they would make village schoolmasters of Herod's sons by his other wives, as their education and their diligence in study fitted them for that work.
πρῶτα μὲν εὐδοκίμους στρατιὰς ἀπε- φαινόμεθ’, ἠδὲ πολίσματα πύργινα πάντ’ ἐπέρθομεν.	In the first place we showed to the world armies worthy of our fame, and civil institutions, like towers in strength, regulated all the state
ἡμεῖς δ’ ἐπειδὴ τοὺς ἁρμόζοντας πεποιήμεθα λόγους ὑπὲρ τῆς παρεκβάσεως, ἐπανελθόντες ἐπὶ τὰς πράξεις πειρασόμεθα προστιθέντες ἀεὶ τὸν ἑξῆς λόγον εἰς ἀληθινὰς ἐννοίας ἄγειν διὰ βραχέων τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας ὑπὲρ τοῦ προειρημένου πολέμου.	I have now said what was proper on the subject of this digression. Returning to the matter in hand I will endeavour by a continuous narrative of moderate dimensions to guide my readers to a true knowledge of this war.
ὅσοι δ’ αὖ ὠσίαν, σχεδόν τι αὖ οὗτοι καθ’ Ἡράκλειτον ἂν ἡγοῖντο τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν·	Those on the other hand, who say ὠσία would agree, well enough with Heracleitus that all things move and nothing remains still.
ὅτι γὰρ οἱ ταῖς ἀρεταῖς διενεγκόντες ὡς θεοφιλεῖς νέοι μετέστησαν πρὸς τὸ χρεὼν καὶ πάλαι μὲν διὰ τῶν πρόσθεν ὑπέμνησα λόγων, καὶ νῦν δὲ πειράσομαι διὰ βραχυτάτων ἐπιδραμεῖν, προσμαρτυρήσας τῷ καλῶς ὑπὸ Μενάνδρου ῥηθέντι τούτῳ ὃν οἱ θεοὶ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνῄσκει νέος ἀλλ’ ἴσως ὑποτυχὼν ἂν φαίης Ἀπολλώνιε φίλτατε,σφόδρ’ ἦν ἐπιτεταγμένος ὁ νεανίσκος Ἀπόλλωνι καὶ μοίραις, καὶ σὲ ἔδει ὑπ’ ἐκείνου τελείου γενομένου κηδευθῆναι μεταλλάξαντα τὸν βίον·	For that virtuous men die in the prime of their years by the kindness of the Gods, to whom they are peculiarly dear, I have already told thee in the former part of my discourse, and will give a short hint of it now, bearing witness to that which is so prettily said by Menander — He whom the Gods do love dies young. But perhaps, my dear Apollonius, thou wilt thus object to me My young Apollonius was blessed by fortune in his life, and I ought first to have died that he might bury me
ἐφωράθη δὲ νοσφισάμενος τά τε ἄλλα καὶ τοὔλαιον· ἐλεγχόμενος δ’ ὑπὸ τῶν κατηγόρων ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἀντωνίου παρῃτεῖτο τὴν ὀργήν, σὺν ἄλλοις καὶ ταῦτα λέγων ὅτι ὥσπερ Ὅμηρος ἐξύμνησεν Ἀχιλλέα καὶ Ἀγαμέμνονα καὶ Ὀδυσσέα, οὕτως ἐγὼ σέ·	He was detected in secreting, among other things, even the oil, and when charged with this offence by his accusers in the presence of Antony, he deprecated his anger by this, among other remarks in his speech, that as Homer had sung the praises of Achilles, Agamemnon, and Ulysses, so have I sung yours.
μιᾷ μάχῃ Φίλιππος ἀπέβαλε Μακεδονίαν, μιᾷ πληγῇ παρεχώρησεν Ἀντίοχος Ἀσίας, ἅπαξ Καρχηδόνιοι σφα λέντες ἀπώλεσαν Λιβύην.	At one battle Philip was forced to quit all Macedonia, by one stroke Antiochus was beaten out of Asia, by one victory the Carthaginians lost Libya
διὸ λέγεται καὶ τοῦτο καλῶς, ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν εὖ ἄρξαι μὴ ἀρχθέντα.	Hence there is much truth in the saying that it is impossible to become a good ruler without having been a subject.
τραπέντα ναύφρακτον ἐρεῖς ὅμιλον;	Are you speaking of the routed multitude which manned your ships?
οἱ δὲ ἀντιλέγειν μὲν οὐκ ἐτόλμων, παρεκάλουν δ' ὅμως τόν τε Φᾶδον καὶ τὸν Λογγῖνον, ἀφίκετο γὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς τὰ Ἱεροσόλυμα πολλὴν ἐπαγόμενος δύναμιν φόβῳ τοῦ μὴ τὰ προστάγματα Φάδου τὸ πλῆθος τῶν Ἰουδαίων νεωτερίζειν ἀναγκάσῃ, πρῶτον μὲν αὐτοῖς ἐπιτρέψαι πρέσβεις ὡς Καίσαρα πέμψαι τοὺς αἰτησομένους παρ' αὐτοῦ τὴν ἱερὰν στολὴν ὑπὸ τὴν αὐτῶν ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν, εἶτα δὲ περιμεῖναι μέχρις ἂν γνῶσιν, τί πρὸς ταῦτα Κλαύδιος ἀποκρίναιτο.	They dared not contradict what he had said, but petitioned Fadus and Longinus, who had arrived in Jerusalem with a large army with him, for fear that the instructions of Fadus should force the Jews to rebel, in the first place for leave to send envoys to Caesar, to ask his permission to keep the holy vestments in their own power, and secondly, to wait until they learned Claudius' answer to this request.
τὴν δὴ φάντασμα ἀλλ’ οὐκ εἰκόνα ἀπεργαζομένην τέχνην ἆρ’ οὐ φανταστικὴν ὀρθότατ’ ἂν προσαγορεύοιμεν;	And to the art which produces appearance, but not likeness, the most correct name we could give would be fantastic art, would it not?
μνησθήσομαι Ῥαὰβ καὶ Βαβυλῶνος τοῖς γινώσκουσίν με· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ Τύρος καὶ λαὸς Αἰθιόπων, οὗτοι ἐγενήθησαν ἐκεῖ.	I will remember Rahab and Babylon to those knowing me. And behold, foreigners and Tyre and the people of Ethiopia, these were born there.
ὁ ἄφρων περιέλαβεν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφαγεν τὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ.	The fool has folded his hands and eaten his muscles.
Τῷ δὲ πλήθει τῶν πολιτῶν δαιμόνιόν τινα τὴν χαρὰν παρεῖχε τὸ βλέπειν αὐτοὺς ἤδη τοὺς τρεῖς ἐν ταὐτῷ γεγονότας.	The thronging citizens were ecstatic to see all three of them together, as they did now.
Ἐὰν δὲ προσφέρῃς θυσίαν πρωτογενημάτων τῷ κυρίῳ, ἁπαλόν, νέα πεφρυγμένα χίδρα ἐρικτὰ τῷ κυρίῳ· καὶ προσοίσεις τὴν θυσίαν τῶν πρωτογενημάτων·	“ ‘And if you present a sacrifice of firstfruits to the Lord, tender, newly roasted grain, hulled kernels ground for the Lord, thus you will offer the sacrifice of the firstfruits.
πολύευκτον δὲ τὸν Κυδαντίδην τοῦ δήμου προστάξαντος ζητῆσαι τὴν βουλήν, εἰ συνέρχεται τοῖς φυγάσιν εἰς Μέγαρα, καὶ ζητήσασαν ἀποφῆναι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἀπέφηνεν ἡ βουλὴ συνιέναι.	In the case of Polyeuctus of Cydantidae, when the people instructed the council to inquire whether he was accompanying the exiles to Megara and to report back after the investigation, it reported that he was doing so.
Ἱερώνυμος δ’ ὁ περιπατητικὸς περισπουδάστους φησὶν γενέσθαι τοὺς τῶν παίδων ἔρωτας, ὅτι πολλάκις ἡ τῶν νέων ἀκμὴ καὶ τὸ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἑταιρικὸν συμφρονῆσαν πολλὰς τυραννίδας καθεῖλεν.	But Hieronymus the Peripatetic says that the ancients were anxious to encourage the practice of having boy-favourites, because the vigorous disposition of youths, and the confidence engendered by their association with each other, has often led to the overthrow of tyrannies.
Συνερχέσθωσαν δὲ εἰς ἣν ἀποφήνωσι πόλιν τὸν νεὼν τρὶς τοῦ ἔτους οἱ ἐκ τῶν περάτων τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἂν Ἑβραῖοι κρατῶσιν, ὅπως τῷ θεῷ τῶν μὲν ὑπηργμένων εὐχαριστῶσι καὶ περὶ τῶν εἰς τὸ μέλλον παρακαλῶσι καὶ συνιόντες ἀλλήλοις καὶ συνευωχούμενοι προσφιλεῖς ὦσι:	Let those who live at the extremities of the land ruled by the Hebrews come three times a year to that city that holds the temple, to thank God for good things already received and to pray for those they need in the future. So let them maintain friendly relations with each other by such meetings and communal feasts.
ἐς δὲ τὴν Ἠλείαν κατιὼν ἐξ Ἡραίας στάδια μέν που πέντε καὶ δέκα ἀποσχὼν Ἡραίας διαβήσῃ τὸν Λάδωνα, ἀπὸ τούτου δὲ ἐς Ἐρύμανθον ὅσον εἴκοσιν ἀφίξῃ σταδίοις.	As you go down to the land of Elis from Heraea, at a distance of about fifteen stades from Heraea you will cross the Ladon, and from it to the Erymanthus is a journey of roughly twenty stades.
ἢ πῶς ἔτι δυνήσῃ εἰπεῖν τὸ τοῦ Σωκράτους εἰ ταύτῃ φίλον τῷ θεῷ, ταύτῃ γινέσθω;	Or how will you still be able to say as Socrates did, If so it pleases God, so let it be?
τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως πυθομένου, τίσιν ἐπιθέμενος τὴν λείαν ἀπήλασε; τοῖς πρὸς τὸν νότον τῶν Ἰουδαίων τετραμμένοις καὶ ἐν τῇ πεδιάδι κατοικοῦσιν εἰπὼν πείθει τὸν Ἀγχοῦν φρονῆσαι οὕτως: [ἤλπισε γὰρ οὗτος,] ὅτι Δαυίδης ἐμίσησε τὸ ἴδιον ἔθνος, καὶ δοῦλον ἕξειν παρ' ὃν ζῇ χρόνον ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῦ καταμένοντα.	When the king asked whom they had attacked when they took the booty, he said they were to the south of the Jews, and people living in the plains. This got the agreement of Achus, who hoped that David now hated his own nation and would stay in his region and that he would have him at his service all his life.
καὶ διὰ τοῦτο χαλεπώτερα μηχανῶνται καὶ τολμῶσιν ἐν φόβῳ ἔργα πάντες τοῦτ’ ἀποβαλεῖν γενόμενοι.	and since this last would be the heaviest of all afflictions they all of them contrive and venture upon the most difficult actions, out of the fear of losing the same.
οἱ μὲν γὰρ τῶν Ἰσραηλιτῶν βασιλεῖς ἄλλος ἐπ’ ἄλλῳ διὰ τὴν παρανομίαν καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ πολλοὶ κακῶς διαφθαρέντες ἐγνώσθησαν καὶ τὸ γένος αὐτῶν, ὁ δὲ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων καὶ τῶν δύο φυλῶν βασιλεὺς Ἄσανος δι’ εὐσέβειαν καὶ δικαιοσύνην εἰς μακρὸν καὶ εὔδαιμον ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ προήχθη γῆρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἓν ἄρξας ἔτος εὐμοίρως ἀπέθανε.	for many of these kings of Israel, they and their families, were miserably destroyed, and taken away one by another, in a short time, for their transgression and wickedness but Asa, who was king of Jerusalem, and of the two tribes, attained, by God's blessing, a long and a blessed old age, for his piety and righteousness, and died happily, when he had reigned forty and one years
Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, Ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι μεθ' ὑμῶν; Ἕως πότε ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν; Φέρετέ μοι αὐτὸν ὧδε.	Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me."
οὐδενὶ γὰρ οὐδὲν ὑπολειπομένη πλεονέκτημα τῶν ἐξ ἀρχῆς, ἴσα δὲ πάντα ποιοῦσα τοῖς ἀεὶ προσλαμβανομένοις ταχέως καθικνεῖτο τῆς προκειμένης ἐπιβολῆς, δύο συνεργοῖς χρωμένη τοῖς ἰσχυροτάτοις, ἰσότητι καὶ φιλανθρωπίᾳ.	for none of the original members had any special privilege reserved for them, but equal rights were given to all comers the object aimed at was therefore quickly attained by the two most unfailing expedients of equality and fraternity.
οἱ μὲν οὖν Ἀχαιοὶ συνεληλυθότες εἰς Αἴγιον ἐκεῖ τὸν Ἄρατον ἐκάλουν.	Accordingly, the Achaeans came together at Aegium and invited Aratus thither.
ὁ δὲ Λουκᾶς ἐν ταῖς Πράξεσι τῶν ἀποστόλων τῶν Φιλίππου θυγατέρων ἐν Καισαρείᾳ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἅμα τῷ πατρὶ τότε διατριβουσῶν, προφητικοῦ τε χαρίσματος ἠξιωμένων, μνημονεύει κατὰ λέξιν ὧδέ πως λέγων “ἤλθομεν εἰς Και“σάρειαν, καὶ εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου “τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦ ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐμείναμεν παρ αὐτῷ.	Αnd Luke in the Acts of the Apostles mentions the daughters of Philip who were then living with their father at Caesarea in Judaea and were vouchsafed the gift of prophecy. Ηe says as follows “ We came to Caesarea and entered into the house οf Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven, and remained with him.
τοὺς δ’ ἵππους διέδωκε τῷ στρατῷ.	He gave their horses to his own army.
δίκαιον γὰρ εἶναι πᾶσι τοῖς ξυμμάχοις γεγράφθαι τὴν μετάθεσιν.	any alteration should properly have been made conditional upon the consent of the whole body of the allies.
ὁ δ’ ἐλθὼν μεταξὺ ἐμοῦ τε καὶ τοῦ Κριτίου ἐκαθέζετο.	and he came and sat down between me and Critias.
συνεληλυθότος γὰρ τοῦ πλήθους ἐπὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα καὶ τῆς Ῥωμαϊκῆς σπείρας ὑπὲρ τὴν τοῦ ἱεροῦ στοὰν ἐφεστώσης, ἔνοπλοι δ’ ἀεὶ τὰς ἑορτὰς παραφυλάττουσιν, ὡς μή τι νεωτερίζοι τὸ πλῆθος ἠθροισμένον, εἷς τις τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἀνασυράμενος τὴν ἐσθῆτα καὶ κατακύψας ἀσχημόνως προσαπέστρεψεν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τὴν ἕδραν καὶ τῷ σχήματι φωνὴν ὁμοίαν ἐπεφθέγξατο.	for when the multitude were come together to Jerusalem, to the feast of unleavened bread, and a Roman cohort stood over the cloisters of the temple, (for they always were armed, and kept guard at the festivals, to prevent any innovation which the multitude thus gathered together might make,) one of the soldiers pulled back his garment, and cowering down after an indecent manner, turned his breech to the Jews, and spake such words as you might expect upon such a posture.
εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀρμένιε, πότερα βούλει αὐτοῦ μένων τῷ λιμῷ καὶ τῷ δίψει μάχεσθαι ἢ εἰς τὸ ἰσόπεδον καταβὰς ἡμῖν διαμάχεσθαι; ἀπεκρίνατο ὁ Ἀρμένιος ὅτι οὐδετέροις βούλοιτο μάχεσθαι.	Tell me, king of Armenia, he said, whether you prefer to remain there and fight against hunger and thirst, or to come down into the plain and fight it out with us?The Armenian answered that he had no wish to fight against either.
Τίς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν; Δειξάτω ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν πρᾳΰτητι σοφίας.	Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.
ἀνυπέρβλητος δὲ πέπηγεν οὖρος. ἀμώμητον δ’ οὐδὲν ἔγεντο βροτοῖς.	And now the boundary which none can pass Is well defined, though nought that men can do Will ever wholly escape blame or envy.
μείνασ’ οὖν ἔτι σμικρὸν χρόνον, ἢν μέν τις ἡμῖν πύργος ἀσφαλὴς φανῇ, δόλῳ μέτειμι τόνδε καὶ σιγῇ φόνον·	So I will wait yet a little while in case some tower of defence rise up for me then will I proceed to this bloody deed in crafty silence
τοιόνδε τοίνυν ἔγωγε ὑποπτεύω·	Something of this sort, then, is what I suspect
οἱ οἰκτιρμοί σου πολλοί, Κύριε, σφόδρα· κατὰ τὰ κρίματά σου ζῆσόν με.	Your compassions are very many, O Lord. According to your judgments make me alive.
καὶ Ζακανθαίων οἱ πρέσβεις ἐς δίκην αὐτοὺς προυκαλοῦντο ἐπὶ Ῥωμαίων κριτῶν· οἱ δ’ οὐκ ἔφασαν χρῄζειν δίκης, ἀμύνεσθαι δυνάμενοι.	When the Saguntines offered to submit the whole question to the Romans as arbitrators, the Carthaginians replied that there was no use of an arbitration because they were able to avenge themselves.
οὐκοῦν ἔμ’ ἀρκεῖ τῶνδε βουλεύειν πέρι.	Surely it is enough that I am making plans for this?
ἐπειδὴ δὲ πλείστας αἱ πρὸς τοὺς πολιτικοὺς ἀγῶνας ἀποκνήσεις καὶ μαλακίαι προφάσεις ἔχουσαι τελευταίαν ὥσπερ τὴν ἀφ’ ἱερᾶς ἐπάγουσιν ἡμῖν τὸ γῆρας, καὶ μάλιστα δὴ τούτῳ τὸ φιλότιμον ἀμβλύνειν καὶ δυσωπεῖν δοκοῦσαι πείθουσιν εἶναί τινα πρέπουσαν οὐκ ἀθλητικῆς μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ πολιτικῆς περιόδου κατάλυσιν οἴομαι δεῖν ἃ πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν ἑκάστοτε λογίζομαι καὶ πρὸς σὲ διελθεῖν περὶ τῆς πρεσβυτικῆς πολιτείας· ὅπως;	That he and Plutarch were aged men when the essay was written appears from the opening sentences (see also Chapter 17, towards the end, 792 f). He was evidently a man of some distinction at Athens, where he held important offices (Chapter 20, 794 b).
’ νεβροὺς κοιμήσασα νεηγενέας γαλαθηνούς .	After she'd lull'd to sleep the new-born kids, As yet unweaned from their mother's breast.
ὁ μὲν οὖν Θουκυδίδης, ὡς ἀναγκαίως ἑπομένου τῷ δύνασθαι τοῦ φθονεῖσθαι, καλῶς φησὶ βουλεύεσθαι τὸν ἐπὶ· μεγίστοις λαμβάνοντα τὸ ἐπίφθονον·	Thucydides is of opinion, since there is a necessary connection between envy and great undertakings, that he takes the wisest counsel who incurs envy by aiming the highest.
κἀγὼ δέ, εἰ μὲν ὑμεῖς ἐθέλετε ἐξορμᾶν ἐπὶ ταῦτα, ἕπεσθαι ὑμῖν βούλομαι, εἰ δ’ ὑμεῖς τάττετ’ ἐμὲ ἡγεῖσθαι, οὐδὲν προφασίζομαι τὴν ἡλικίαν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκμάζειν ἡγοῦμαι ἐρύκειν ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ τὰ κακά.	As for me, if you choose to set out upon this course, I am ready to follow you but if you assign me the leadership, I do not plead my youth as an excuse rather, I believe I am in the very prime of my power to ward off dangers from my own head.
λέγεται δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ Εὐπολέμῳ καὶ τάδε, ὡς ἐφεστήκοιεν τρεῖς ἐπὶ τῷ δρόμῳ Ἑλλανοδίκαι, νικᾶν δὲ τῷ μὲν Εὐπολέμῳ δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν δοῖεν, ὁ τρίτος δὲ Ἀμβρακιώτῃ Λέοντι, καὶ ὡς χρημάτων καταδικάσαιτο ὁ Λέων ἐπὶ τῆς Ὀλυμπικῆς βουλῆς ἑκατέρου τῶν Ἑλλανοδικῶν οἳ νικᾶν τὸν Εὐπόλεμον ἔγνωσαν.	It is also said of Eupolemus that three umpires stood on the course, of whom two gave their verdict in favour of Eupolemus and one declared the winner to be Leon the Ambraciot. Leon, they say, got the Olympic Council to fine each of the umpires who had decided in favour of Eupolemus.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὁμιλεῖν αὐτοὺς καὶ συζητεῖν, καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐγγίσας συνεπορεύετο αὐτοῖς.	So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.
οὐδὲ δὴ τὸ ἡμιόλιον οὐδὲ τἆλλα τὰ τοιαῦτα, τὸ ἥμισυ, τὴν τοῦ ὅλου, καὶ τριτημόριον αὖ καὶ πάντα τὰ τοιαῦτα, εἴπερ ἕπῃ τε καὶ συνδοκεῖ σοι οὕτως.	and so one-and-a-half and other mixed fractions and one-third and other simple fractions reject the idea of the whole.
ψεῦδος δὲ ὂν οὐδὲν ἧττον συμβαίνει.	and though it is not true, yet none the less it does result.
Ταῦτα ἀγαπητοὶ χορεύσας μεθ’ ἡμῶν ὁ κύριος ἐθῆλθεν·	Thus, my beloved, having danced with us the Lord went forth.
παχὺς δὲ ὅκως ὑπόλεπτος, ἢ λεπτὸς ἰχὼρ καὶ κάκοδμος.	in thickness like a thinnish or thin and fetid ichor.
οὐ πάνυ χαρίεν, ἔφη· τὸ γὰρ τῷ εὖ λέγοντι χαλεπαίνειν οὐκ ἔχει χάριν.	Not altogether charming, he said, for there is no grace or charm in being angry with him who speaks well.
διακαρτεροῦντός τε τοῦ Τίρωνος ὁρῶν ὁ νεανίσκος τὸν πατέρα χαλεπῶς μὲν ἤδη διακείμενον, ἔχοντα δὲ οὐδεμίαν ἐλπίδα σωτηρίας αὑτῷ τε τὸ μέλλον ἐκ τῆς περὶ τὸν πάσχοντα δυσχερείας προῦπτον, ἔφη μηνύσειν τῷ βασιλεῖ τὴν ἀλήθειαν, εἰ παραιτήσεται διὰ τοῦ φράσαι τῆς βασάνου καὶ τῆς αἰκίας αὐτόν τε καὶ τὸν πατέρα.	but while Tero bore up himself, his son seeing his father already in a sad case, and had no hope of deliverance, and perceiving what would be the consequence of his terrible sufferings, said, that if the king would free him and his father from these torments for what he should say, he would tell the truth.
πρότερον μὲν γὰρ βραχεῖαι γιγνόμεναι αἱ ἐσβολαὶ τὸν ἄλλον χρόνον τῆς γῆς ἀπολαύειν οὐκ ἐκώλυον·	For the former invasions, having been short, hindered them not from reaping the benefit of the earth for the rest of the time.
ἄν σοι δόξῃ, πυθοῦ μου καὶ εἰ πολιτεύσεται.	If you please, ask me also if a Cynic shall engage in the administration of the state.
περὶ μὲν οὖν βασιλείας διωρίσαμεν ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις λόγοις, ἐν οἷς περὶ τῆς μάλιστα λεγομένης βασιλείας ἐποιούμεθα τὴν σκέψιν, πότερον ἀσύμφορος ἢ συμφέρει ταῖς πόλεσιν, καὶ τίνα καὶ πόθεν δεῖ καθιστάναι, καὶ πῶς·	The nature of kingship we have defined in our first discourses, in which we examined the question in relation to the constitution most commonly denoted by the term ‘kingship,’ whether it is disadvantageous or an advantage to states, and what person ought to be set up as king, and from what source, and by what procedure
μετῄει δὲ καὶ ὁ Καῖσαρ, οὐκ ἐς τὴν βουλὴν ἔτι πέμπων, ἀλλ’ ἐς τὸν Κικέρωνα ἰδίᾳ, καὶ αὐτὸν παρεκάλει καὶ συνάρξαι, ὡς Κικέρωνα μὲν τὴν ἀρχὴν διοικήσοντα πρεσβύτερόν τε καὶ ἐμπειρότερον ὄντα, αὐτὸς δὲ τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν καρπωσόμενος μόνην ἐς ἀπόθεσιν τῶν ὅπλων εὐπρεπῆ, οὗ δὴ καὶ πρῴην ἕνεκα τὸν θρίαμβον αἰτῆσαι.	But Octavius also sought it, applying not to the Senate, but to Cicero privately, whom he urged to become his colleague, saying that Cicero should carry on the government, as he was the elder and more experienced, and that he (Octavius) would enjoy the title only, by which means he could dismiss his army in a becoming manner, for which reason he had previously asked the honor of a triumph.
ὡς δ’ εἰώθει, παραμιγνὺς πίστεως ἕνεκα τοῖς ψόγοις ἐπαίνους τινὰς Ἰσαγόρης δέ φησὶν ὁ Τισάνδρου οἰκίης μὲν ἦν δοκίμου, ἀτὰρ τὰ ἀνέκαθεν οὐκ ἔχω φράσαι θύουσι δ’ οἱ συγγενεῖς αὐτοῦ Διὶ Καρίῳ εὔρυθμὸς γε καὶ πολιτικὸς ὁ μυκτὴρ τοῦ συγγραφέως, εἰς Κᾶρας ὥσπερ εἰς κόρακας ἀποδιοπομπουμένου τὸν Ἰσαγόραν.	Then, as his manner is, to gain credit by mixing some praises with his reproaches, he says Isagoras the son of Tisander was of a noble family, but I cannot tell the original of it his kinsmen, however, sacrifice to the Carian Jupiter. O this pleasant and cunning scoffer of a writer, who thus disgracefully sends Isagoras to the Carians, as it were to the ravens.
‘ὅτι μὲν καλὰ τὰ προειργασμένα καὶ ὑπὲρ καλῶν τῶν μελλόντων ὁ ἀγὼν ἔσται, ὦ Συρακόσιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι, οἵ τε πολλοὶ δοκεῖτε ἡμῖν εἰδέναι οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν οὕτως αὐτῶν προθύμως ἀντελάβεσθε, καὶ εἴ τις μὴ ἐπὶ ὅσον δεῖ ᾔσθηται, σημανοῦμεν.	— ‘Syracusans and allies, the glorious character of our past achievements and the no less glorious results at issue in the coming battle are, we think, understood by most of you, or you would never have thrown yourselves with such ardor into the struggle and if there be any one not as fully aware of the facts as he ought to be, we will declare them to him.
οὐ γὰρ εὐσχημοσύνης τε καὶ ἀσχημοσύνης ῥημάτων ἕνεκα τὰ νῦν σκοπούμεθα πρὸς τὸν τῶν πολλῶν λόγον, ἀλλ’ ὀρθότητός τε καὶ ἁμαρτίας πέρι νόμων, ἥτις ποτ’ ἐστὶν φύσει.	for our present reference to the usage of ordinary speech is not concerned with the propriety or impropriety of verbal phrases but with the essential rightness or wrongness of laws.
ἐνταῦθα δὲ ἐκπεπληγμένοι ἦσαν καὶ ἐδεδίεσαν τὴν στρατιὰν οἱ τὴν μισθοφορὰν ὑπεσχημένοι.	Consequently the men who had promised the pay were panic-stricken, and stood in fear of the army.
σῶσόν με ἀπὸ πηλοῦ, ἵνα μὴ ἐνπαγῶ· ῥυσθείην ἐκ τῶν μισούντων με καὶ ἐκ τοῦ βάθους τῶν ὑδάτων.	Save me from the mud, that I would not be planted in it. May I be rescued from those who hate me and from the depth of the waters.
ὅταν εἴπῃ τις· ἄνθρωπος μανθάνει, λόγον εἶναι φῂς τοῦτον ἐλάχιστόν τε καὶ πρῶτον;	When one says a man learns, you agree that this is the least and first of sentences, do you not?
ἀναβήσομαι ἐπάνω τῶν νεφῶν, ἔσομαι ὅμοιος τῷ ὑψίστῳ.	I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High!’
ὡς δὲ ἦλθεν, οὐ μακρῶν ἐδέησεν αὐτῷ λόγων, ἀλλὰ τῷ μισεῖν μὲν τὸν Ἀντίπατρον, φονέα μητρὸς ὄντα, βελτίονος δὲ ἀπορεῖν, ἐκεῖνον ἀνηγόρευσαν βασιλέα Μακεδόνων, καὶ παραλαβόντες εὐθὺς κατῆγον εἰς Μακεδονίαν.	When he came to them, there was no need of his making long speeches, but owing to their hatred of Antipater, who was a matricide, and to their lack of a better man, they proclaimed Demetrius king of the Macedonians, and at once went down with him into Macedonia.
Πούπλιος Πούπλιος Δέκιος πρὸς Ἀλβανοὺς πολεμῶν ὄναρ εἶδεν, ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃ, Ῥώμην προσποιήσειν Ῥωμαίοις.	Publius Decius, a Roman, at a time when they were in war with the Albans, had a dream that his death would bring a great advantage to the Romans
ταῦτα δ' ἀπαγγειλάντων πέμπει πάλιν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀξιῶν ἀνωμολογηκότα πάντα εἶναι ἐκείνου δέξασθαι τοὺς πεμφθησομένους εἰς τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν ὑπ' αὐτοῦ δούλους, οἷς ἐρευνήσασι τά τε βασίλεια καὶ τοὺς τῶν φίλων καὶ συγγενῶν οἴκους ἐκέλευε διδόναι πᾶν ὅ τι ἂν ἐν αὐτοῖς εὕρωσι κάλλιστον, τὰ δ' ἀπαρέσαντα σοὶ καταλεί ψουσιν."	When these envoys reported back, he sent to him again demanding that as he accepted that all he owned was his, he must receive whichever of his servants whom he would send the following day and hand over to them whatever they found to be valuable, after searching his palace and the houses of his friends and relatives, and whatever did not please them they would leave behind.
στασιαζόντων δὲ τούτων καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους φιλοτιμουμένων ὑπὲρ τῆς ἰδίας ἀρχῆς πολέμους τε συνεχεῖς καὶ μακροὺς συνέβη γίγνεσθαι καὶ τὰς πόλεις κακοπαθεῖν καὶ πολλοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἀγῶσιν ἀποβάλλειν τῶν οἰκητόρων, ὡς καὶ τὴν Συρίαν ἅπασαν ὑπὸ Πτολεμαίου τοῦ Λάγου τότε Σωτῆρος χρηματίζοντος τἀναντία παθεῖν αὐτοῦ τῇ ἐπικλήσει.	Since ambition caused each of these princes to strive against the others to hold on to power, there were continual lengthy wars and cities suffered and lost many of their inhabitants in those troubled times, so that all Syria endured from Ptolemy the son of Lagus, the opposite of what was meant by his name of Saviour.
διετέλουν γοῦν ἀλλήλων ἐπιθυμοῦντες διὰ τὴν κατὰ τὸν ὕπνον φαντασίαν.	And so for a long time they were in love with one another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their dreams.
νηὸν δὲ προφύλαχθε, δέδεχθε δὲ φῦλ’ ἀνθρώπων ἐνθάδ’ ἀγειρομένων καὶ ἐμὴν ἰθύν τε μάλιστα. δείκνυσθε θνητοῖσι· σὺ δὲ φρεσὶ δέξο θέμιστα.	But guard you my temple and receive the tribes of men that gather to this place, and especially show mortal men my will, and do you keep righteousness in your heart.
προάγοντος οὖν τοῦ Πεισίου, ὁ μὲν Πρωτογένης οὐκ ἀπελείπετο τὰ μὲν συναγανακτῶν τὰ δὲ πραΰνων ἐκεῖνον·	Thus Pisias brake from the company in a fury nor would Protogenes leave him, partly offended at what had happened, and partly to assuage and mollify his friend. But Anthemion
ἐνόμιζον γὰρ τὸ ῥᾷστόν μοι αὐτὸν προστάξαντα τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν διδόναι.	for I thought that it was the easiest task in the world that he was laying upon me as the condition to happiness.
καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἀπαντήσας οὐ συνέβαλεν, ἀλλὰ μέλλειν θεομαχεῖν νομίσας παλινδρομήσας ἧκεν εἰς Μέμφιν ἀναλαβών τε τόν τε Ἆπιν καὶ τὰ ἄλλα τὰ ἐκεῖσε μεταπεμφθέντα ἱερὰ ζῷα εὐθὺς εἰς Αἰθιοπίαν σὺν ἅπαντι τῷ στόλῳ καὶ πλήθει τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἀνήχθη· χάριτι γὰρ ἦν αὐτῷ ὑποχείριος ὁ τῶν Αἰθιόπων βασιλεύς.	But then, thinking that to join battle with them would be to fight against the gods, he returned and came to Memphis, where he took Apis and the other sacred animals he had sent for to him and marched into Ethiopia, with his army and all the Egyptian followers, for the king of Ethiopia was his vassal.
Ἡγεῖτο δὲ τηνικαῦτα τῆς τῶν πιστῶν αὐτόθι διατριβῆς ἀνὴρ κατὰ παιδείαν ἐπιδοξότατος, ὄνομα αὐτῷ Πάνταινος, ἐξ ἀρχαίου ἔθους διδασκαλείου τῶν ἱερῶν λόγων παρ’ αὐτοῖς συνεστῶτος·	X. Αt that time a man very famous for his learning named Pantaenus had charge of the life of the faithful in Αlexandria, for from ancient custom a school of sacred learning eristed among them.
παρασκευαζομένη δὲ καὶ πορίζουσα καὶ διαπειρωμένη πολλῶν δυνάμεων οὐκ ἔλαθεν ἀλλ’ ἐμηνύθη·	In preparing, procuring, and testing many potent mediums she did not go unnoticed, but was betrayed.
νῦν οἶμαι ἐγὼ σοὶ ἐντετυχηκὼς τοιούτῳ ἑρμαίῳ ἐντετυχηκέναι.	I am just thinking what a lucky stroke I have had in striking up with you.
εὐλογεῖτε, πάγος καὶ ψῦχος, τὸν κύριον· ὑμνεῖτε καὶ ὑπερυψοῦτε αὐτὸν εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.	Bless the Lord, O frost and cold; sing and exalt him ⌊forever⌋.
πῶς δὲ χρὴ τούτῳ πιστεύειν ὑπὲρ αὑτοῦ λέγοντι, ὃς ὑπὲρ ἑτέρων ἐπιορκῶν ἐξελέγχεται;	How is it right to trust this man when he speaks in his own behalf, who is proved guilty of perjury in his testimony on behalf of another?
ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως ὦ φίλτατε σπονδὰς ποιεῖσθαι ψηφιεῖ.	i' m just drawing off my shoes.... you' re sure you will vote for peace? i'll think about it.
καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἑζεκίας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ προσεύξατο πρὸς Κύριον	And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
τίς ὑμῶν εἰς βαλανεῖον ἀπελθεῖν θέλων εἰς μυλῶνα ἀπῆλθεν;	Which of you, when he wished to go into a bath, ever went into a mill?
Κύριε, εἰσάκουσον τῆς φωνῆς μου· γενηθήτω τὰ ὦτά σου προσέχοντα εἰς τὴν φωνὴν τῆς δεήσεώς μου.	O Lord, hearken to my voice. Let your ears be giving heed to the voice of my entreaty.
δοκιμάζει δὲ καὶ τοὺς προδρόμους, οἵτινες ἂν αὐτῇ δοκῷσιν ἐπιτήδειοι προδρομεύειν εἶναι, κἄν τιν᾽ ἀποχειροτονήσῃ, καταβέβηκεν οὗτος.	it also inspects the mounted skirmishers, to see which it considers fit for skirmishing duty, and any that it votes to reject are thereby deposed from that rank.
δώδεκα δεσμὰ ῥάβδων καὶ τρὶς ἢ τετράκις ἐπὶ βῆμα καθίσαι καὶ κιρκήσια δοῦναι καὶ σπυρίσιν δειπνίσαι.	Twelve bundles of rods to sit three or four times on the tribunal to give the games of the circus, and suppers in baskets to all the world
οὗτος ἑστὼς πρὸ τῆς γεφύρας ἠμύνετο τοὺς πολεμίους, ἄχρι οὗ διέκοψαν οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ κατόπιν τὴν γέφυραν.	This Cocles, standing at the head of the bridge, kept the enemy back until his companions had cut the bridge in two behind him.
ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ὑπ’ ὀργῆς προήχθησαν τῷ κατὰ τὴν γυναῖκα πάθει προσλαβόντες καὶ τὸ κατὰ τὴν ἀναίρεσιν τῶν ὁπλιτῶν.	To such a degree had they proceeded in their anger, because they not only had the suffering of the Levite's wife to avenge, but the slaughter of their own soldiers.
καὶ ἐξέτεινεν τὰς αὐλαίας ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὸ κατακάλυμμα τῆς σκηνῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἄνωθεν, καθὰ συνέταξεν Κύριος τῷ Μωσῇ.	And he stretched out the curtains over the tabernacle, and he attached the covering of the tabernacle to it on top, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
ἐὰν ἀναβῶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, σὺ ἐκεῖ εἶ: ἐὰν ἀπέλθω εἰς τὰ ἔσχατα τῆς γῆς. ἐκεῖ ἡ δεξιά σου:	If I ascend into heaven thou art there, if I depart to the ends of the earth there is thy right hand
Σίμων Σίμων, ἰδοὺ ὁ σατανᾶς ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον.	"Simon, Simon, pay attention! Satan has demanded to have you all, to sift you like wheat,
καὶ τόδε μὲν ἐπῇρε Ῥωμαίους, νυκτὸς δὲ φόβοι πολλοὶ κατεῖχον·	This victory raised the spirits of the Romans, but the next night they were seized with panic.
ἄριστον καὶ ἔνθα οἱ τῆς δάφνης ἔασι καρποὶ, καὶ τὸ μάλαγμα ἐπίκλησιν τὸ χλωρὸν, καὶ τοὐμὸν τὸ μυστήριον.	The best thing here is the fruit of the bay, and the Malagma by name the Green, and mine--the Mystery.
ἐπεὶ γὰρ ἀὴρ μὲν σβεννυμένου πυρὸς ὑφίσταται, καὶ λεπτυνόμενος αὖθις ἐξ αὑτοῦ πῦρ ἀναδίδωσιν, ἐν τοῖς ἑκατέροις σπέρμασι τὰ πάθη δεῖ θεᾶσθαι καὶ τὰς μεταβολάς.	Air is engendered by the extinction of fire, and the same being subtilized and rarefied produceth fire. Now by the seeds of these two we may find out the passions and transmutations of all.
πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τὸν χρόνον ἐμαυτῷ ἡγοῦμαι μάρτυρα εἶναι τοῦ μὴ ἀληθὲς τὸ ἔγκλημα εἶναι.	In the first place, I hold that the time is a witness for me to prove that the charge is groundless.
πολλάκις δ’ ἐν νόσοις ἡ φύσις διὰ μὲν τῶν αὐτῶν δήπου φλεβῶν τὸ πᾶν ἐκκαθαίρει ζῷον, οὐ μὴν αἱματώδης γ’ ἡ κένωσις αὐτοῖς, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸν λυποῦντα γίγνεται χυμόν.	Frequently also in disease Nature purges the animal through these same veins- although in this case the discharge is not sanguineous, but corresponds to the humour which is at fault.
Βοῦρα δὲ καὶ Ἑλίκη ἡ μὲν ὑπὸ χάσματος ἡ δ’ ὑπὸ κύματος ἠφανίσθη.	Of Bura and Helice, one has been swallowed by an earthquake, the other covered by the waves.
χειμερίου δὲ τοῦ πνεύματος ὄντος θαρρεῖν ἐκέλευον οἱ θεράποντες τὸν κυβερνήτην ὡς τῷδε μάλιστα λησόμενοι τοὺς πολεμίους ἐγγὺς ὄντας.	As there was a severe wind blowing the servants told the pilot to be of good courage and seize this opportunity to avoid the enemy who were in the neighborhood.
ἐπειδὴ δ’ ἀνέστη, διῆλθε μιμούμενος τήν τε τοῦ παιδὸς καὶ τὴν τῆς παιδὸς ὄρχησιν.	So he got up and mimicked in detail the dancing of both the boy and the girl.
Εἰ δὲ τοίνυν τῶν μέχρι θανάτου πόνων ὑπερεφρόνησαν οἱ ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοί, συνομολογεῖται πανταχόθεν, ὅτι αὐτοδέσποτός ἐστιν τῶν παθῶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμός.	If the seven brothers accordingly despised sufferings until death, all kinds of people will agree that pious reason is sovereign over the emotions.
τά τε νοσεύματα ἐλάσσω μὲν γίνεται καὶ ἀσθενέστερα, ἔοικε δὲ τοῖς ἐν τῇσι πόλεσι γενομένοις νοσεύμασι τῇσι πρὸς τὰ θερμὰ πνεύματα ἐστραμμένῃσιν.	the diseases, while resembling those which we said occur in cities facing the hot winds, are both fewer and less severe.
εἶπεν δὲ Ἀβραὰμ περὶ Σάρρας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ ὅτι Ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ εἰπεῖν ὅτι Γυνή μού ἐστιν, μή ποτε ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως δι᾽ αὐτήν. ἀπέστειλεν δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ βασιλεὺς Γεράρων καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν Σάρραν.	Abraham said concerning Sarah, his wife, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” ⌊lest⌋ the men of the city kill him because of her. Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.
Ἀνῄρουν δὲ καὶ τὸ κριτήριον λόγῳ τοιῷδε.	Again, they would destroy the criterion by reasoning of this kind.
ἐλθὼν δ’ ἐγὼ ἠγανάκτουν μὲν πρὸς Ἡγήμονα τὸν ἔχοντα τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα, λόγους δ’ ἐποιούμην πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ἐπιτηδείους, ἠξίουν δὲ τοῦτον εἰς ἔλεγχον ἰέναι περὶ τῶν χρημάτων.	I went first and expressed my indignation to Hegemon, the husband of this man’s daughter I then discussed the matter with the other relations and I called upon this man to allow his handling of the money to be investigated.
καὶ μὴ παλαιὰς ἀρετάς, εἴ τις ἄρα καὶ ἐγένετο, ἀκούοντες ἐπικλασθῆτε, ἃς χρὴ τοῖς μὲν ἀδικουμένοις ἐπικούρους εἶναι, τοῖς δὲ αἰσχρόν τι δρῶσι διπλασίας ζημίας, ὅτι οὐκ ἐκ προσηκόντων ἁμαρτάνουσιν.	We would also prevent you from being melted by hearing of their past virtues, if any such they had these may be fairly appealed to by the victims of injustice, but only aggravate the guilt of criminals, since they offend against their better nature.
ἀλλὰ κατὰ γένος ἠμφισβήτουν, οὐ κατὰ δόσιν, ὥστ’ οὐδὲν ἔδει μαρτύρων.	No, I was claiming by right of kinship, not of testamentary disposition, so that I had no need of witnesses.
πέψει γάρ τινι τῶν ὑγρῶν ὁ Θεόφραστός; φησιν ἐπιγίγνεσθαι τὴν εὐωδίαν, ὅταν ἐξαιρεθῇ τὸ βλαβερὸν ὑγρὸν ὑπὸ θερμότητος.	for a flagrant smell, as Theophrastus thinks, proceeds from a due concoction of the humors, when the noxious moisture is conquered by the heat.
δεινόν τε, ὦ Θεαίτητε, ὡς ἀληθῶς κινδυνεύει καὶ ἀηδὲς εἶναι ἀνὴρ ἀδολέσχης.	Truly, Theaetetus, a garrulous man is a strange and unpleasant creature!
Τοῦτο δέ φημι, ἀδελφοί, ὅτι σὰρξ καὶ αἷμα βασιλείαν θεοῦ κληρονομῆσαι οὐ δύναται, οὐδὲ ἡ φθορὰ τὴν ἀφθαρσίαν κληρονομεῖ.	Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
πῶς ἂν ξίφος νὼ ταὐτόν, εἰ θέμις, κτάνοι καὶ μνῆμα δέξαιθ’ ἕν, κέδρου τεχνάσματα;	If only the same sword, if it is right, could kill us both, and one coffin of cedar-wood receive us!
τῆς Καπανέως δὲ καιομένης πυρᾶς, Εὐάδνη, ἡ Καπανέως μὲν γυνὴ θυγάτηρ δὲ Ἴφιος, ἑαυτὴν ἐμβαλοῦσα συγκατεκαίετο.	And when the pyre of Capaneus was burning, his wife Evadne, the daughter of Iphis, thew herself on the pyre, and was burned with him.
ὁ δὲ τὸν στρατόν, ἔνθαπερ ἦν, ἀπολιπὼν ἐχώρει τῆς ἐπιούσης πρὸς τὸ ἄστυ, φυλακὴν ἔχων ἀμφ’ αὑτὸν ἱκανήν.	On the following day Octavius advanced toward the city, leaving his army where it was, and having with him only a sufficient guard.
ἐγένετο τὸ μαντεῖον ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ τοῦ βαλεῖν χάρακα, τοῦ διανοῖξαι στόμα ἐν βοῇ, ὑψῶσαι φωνὴν μετὰ κραυγῆς, τοῦ βαλεῖν χάρακα ἐπὶ τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς καὶ βαλεῖν χῶμα καὶ οἰκοδομῆσαι βελοστάσεις.	The oracle came against Jerusalem, to put up a palisade, to open the mouth with a shout, to lift up the voice with shouting, to put a palisade against its gates, and to throw up an embankment and to build banks of artillery.
οὕτως ἡ συνεχὴς ἀδικία συγγνώμης τυγχάνει μᾶλλον τῆς σπανίου καὶ παραδόξου πονηρίας.	So true is it that an habitual course of wrong-doing finds readier pardon than when it is spasmodic or isolated.
καλόν, ὦ φίλοι, καλόν, ἕως ἔτι ἐν ὅρμῳ τὸ σκάφος προσκέπτεσθαι τὸν μέλλοντα χειμῶνα μηδ’ εἰς μέσας τὰς θυέλλας ἀπολουμένους ἀναχθῆναι·	But it were best, O my friends, it were best, while the vessel is still in the haven, to foresee the impending storm, and not to set sail out of the port into the middle of the hurricanes
οἱ δὲ νῦν ἀδελφοὶ καὶ συγγενεῖς, ἂν μὴ κλίμασι καὶ ποταμοῖς καὶ διατειχίσμασιν ὁρίσωσι τὰ κοινά καὶ πολλὴν εὐρυχωρίαν ἒν μέσῳ λάβωσιν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων, οὐ παύονται διαφερόμενοι.	Brethren and kinsmen of the present day, however, unless zones and rivers and walls divide their inheritances and wide tracts of land separate them from one another, are continually quarrelling.
ἡνίκα δ᾽ ἂν εἰσεπορεύετο Μωσῆς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, ἱστήκει πᾶς ὁ λαὸς σκοπεύοντες ἕκαστος παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ κατενοοῦσαν ἀπιόντος Μωσῆ ἕως τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν.	And whenever Moses went forth to the tent outside the encampment, all the people would stand watching, each one beside the doors of his tent, and observe intently from when Moses departed until he entered into the tent.
ἀλλὰ καὶ Μητροκλέους ὀνειδίσαντος ἐμὸν οὖν ἔφη ἁμάρτημα τοῦτ’ ἐστὶν ἢ ἐκείνης;	on the contrary, when Metrocles reproached him, he asked, Is this my fault or hers?
καὶ ταῦτ’ εἰκότως ἔπραττον ἐκεῖνοι.	It was natural that they should make this attempt.
καὶ ὁ Κριτόβουλος εἶπεν· ἐγὼ τούτοις, ὦ Σώκρατες, οὐκ ἔχω ἀντιλέγειν· ἀλλ’ ὥρα σοι προστατεύειν ἐμοῦ, ὅπως μὴ τῷ ὄντι οἰκτρὸς γένωμαι.	I cannot dispute this, Socrates, said Critobulus, but it is time for you to take me in hand, and see that I don’t become a real object of pity.
ἦλθ’ ὑπὲρ ἄκρας τύμβου κορυφᾶς φάντασμ’ Ἀχιλέως· ᾔτει δὲ γέρας τῶν πολυμόχθων τινὰ Τρωιάδων.	over the summit of his tomb appeared Achilles’ phantom, and for his prize he would have one of the luckless maids of Troy.
τὸ ἓν εἰ ἔστιν οἷον διεληλύθαμεν, ἆρ’ οὐκ ἀνάγκη αὐτό, ἕν τε ὂν καὶ πολλὰ καὶ μήτε ἓν μήτε πολλὰ καὶ μετέχον χρόνου, ὅτι μὲν ἔστιν ἕν, οὐσίας μετέχειν ποτέ, ὅτι δ’ οὐκ ἔστι, μὴ μετέχειν αὖ ποτε οὐσίας;	If the one is such as we have described it, being both one and many and neither one nor many, and partakes of time, must it not, because one is, sometimes partake of being, and again because one is not, sometimes not partake of being?
υἱοὶ Λόδ, Ἁρὼθ καὶ Ὠνών, ἑξακόσιοι εἴκοσι πέντε·	the descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, six hundred and twenty-five;
ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κακῇ καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως ἕως ἂν ἐκλίπῃ.	in an evil day and in a day of affliction until he faints.
καὶ μήποτε Ἄλεξις ἐν Ἡσιόνῃ θηρικλείῳ ποιεῖ τὸν Ἡρακλέα πίνοντα, ὅταν οὑτωσὶ λέγῃ · γενόμενος δ’ ἔννους μόλις ᾔτησε κύλικα καὶ λαβὼν ἑξῆς πυκνὰς ἕλκει, καταντλεῖ, κατά τε τὴν παροιμίαν αἰεί ποτ’ εὖ μὲν ἀσκός, εὖ δὲ θύλακος ἅνθρωπός ἐστιν.	And, perhaps, it is out of a thericlean cup that Alexis, in his Hesione, represents Hercules to be drinking, when he speaks thus— And when he had, though scarcely, come t' himself, He begg'd a cup of wine (κύλικα), and when he'd got it, He drank down frequent draughts, and drain'd it well And, as the proverb says, the man sometimes Is quite a bladder, and sometimes a sack.
Οὐ γὰρ ἵνα ἄλλοις ἄνεσις, ὑμῖν δὲ θλίψις· ἀλλ' ἐξ ἰσότητος, ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ τὸ ὑμῶν περίσσευμα εἰς τὸ ἐκείνων ὑστέρημα,	Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
“σεβόμεθα γὰρ οὐκ ἔλαττον ἐκείνων τὸν θεόν, ἔφασκον, καὶ τοῦτον ὑπερευχόμεθα καὶ τῆς θρησκείας ἐσμὲν ἐπιθυμηταὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου τοῦ χρόνου, ἀφ’ οὗ Σαλμανασσάρης ὁ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων βασιλεὺς ἐκ τῆς Χουθίας ἡμᾶς μετήγαγεν καὶ Μηδίας ἐνθάδε.	for they said, "We worship their God, and especially pray to him, and are desirous of their religious settlement, and this ever since Shalmanezer, the king of Assyria, transplanted us out of Cuthah and Media to this place."
καρποτελῆ δέ τοι Ζεὺς ἐπικραινέτω φέρματι γᾶν πανώρῳ.	May Zeus cause the earth to bring forth its tribute of fruit by the produce of every season
καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθη ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάτρευσεν τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς ἐλάτρευσεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτοῖς.	He walked in all the ways that his father had walked. He served the images that his father had served, and he worshiped them.
οὗτοι μέντοι ὅταν πρὸς τῇ ἀνάγκῃ ταύτῃ γίγνωνται, ὅμως πρό γε τῆς αἰσχύνης προβάλλονταί τι καὶ συγκλῄουσι τὰς θύρας.	Yet these persons, brought to such straits as that, do nevertheless make some attempt to cover their shame they shut their doors.
οἵ τε γὰρ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ὑπὸ προθυμίας καὶ ἐκπλήξεως ὡς εἰπεῖν ἄλλο οὐδὲν ἢ ἐκ γῆς ἐναυμάχουν, οἵ τε Ἀθηναῖοι κρατοῦντες καὶ βουλόμενοι τῇ παρούσῃ τύχῃ ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐπεξελθεῖν ἀπὸ νεῶν ἐπεζομάχουν.	For the Lacedaemonians, out of eagerness and out of fear, did (as one may say) nothing else but make a sea-fight from the land and the Athenians, who had the victory and desired to extend their present fortune to the utmost, made a land-fight from their galleys.
τελειότερον δὲ λέγομεν τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸ διωκτὸν τοῦ δι’ ἕτερον καὶ τὸ μηδέποτε δι’ ἄλλο αἱρετὸν τῶν καὶ καθ’ αὑτὰ καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ αἱρετῶν, καὶ ἁπλῶς δὴ τέλειον τὸ καθ’ αὑτὸ αἱρετὸν ἀεὶ καὶ μηδέποτε δι’ ἄλλο.	In speaking of degrees of finality, we mean that a thing pursued as an end in itself is more final than one pursued as a means to something else, and that a thing never chosen as a means to anything else is more final than things chosen both as ends in themselves and as means to that thing and accordingly a thing chosen always as an end and never as a means we call absolutely final.
ἢ πεπαῦσθαι νενόμικέ με τῆς παρρησίας, ἣν ἀπὸ ποίου συνειδότος ἔχων βοήσομαι μᾶλλον, ὅσων αὐτὸν ἐξελυσάμην δεινῶν, ὅσους ἤνεγκα πόνους ἐκείνῳ ποριζόμενος σωτηρίαν τε καὶ τιμήν, ὧν γέρας ἠνεγκάμην δεσμὰ καὶ σκότιον εἱρκτήν.	Does he think I will give up speaking my mind? No, I shall do it more loudly than before and tell of the hazards I rescued him from and all I underwent for him, to win him safety and respect, as reward for which I am bound in chains in this dark place?
Προμηθεὺς δὲ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ γῆς ἀνθρώπους πλάσας ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ πῦρ, λάθρᾳ Διὸς ἐν νάρθηκι κρύψας.	Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth and gave them also fire, which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel.
οὐ γὰρ μόνον, ὡς Ἡράκλειτος ἔλεγε, πυρὸς θάνατος ἀέρι γένεσις, καὶ ἀέρος θάνατος; ὕδατι γένεσις, ἀλλ’ ἔτι σαφέστερον ἐπ’ αὐτῶν ἡμῶν·	For not only is it true, as Heracleitus used to say, that the death of heat is birth for steam, and the death of steam is birth for water, but the case is even more clearly to be seen in our own selves
ἀλλ’ ἐμοί γε οὐ πολὺς λόγος, εἰ οὐχ ἱκανὸς φανοῦμαι συγγράφειν, Ἐπικτήτῳ τε οὐδ’ ὀλίγος, εἰ καταφρονήσει τις αὐτοῦ τῶν λόγων, ἐπεὶ καὶ λέγων αὐτοὺς οὐδενὸς ἄλλου δῆλος ἦν ἐφιέμενος ὅτι μὴ κινῆσαι τὰς γνώμας τῶν ἀκουόντων πρὸς τὰ βέλτιστα.	But it concerns me little if I shall be considered incompetent to write and it concerns Epictetus not at all if any man shall despise his words for at the time when he uttered them, it was plain that he had no other purpose than to move the minds of his hearers to the best things.
οὐ γὰρ εἰ βούλονται ὑγιαίνειν, ὑγιαίνουσιν, ὥστ’ οὐδ’ εἰ φίλοι βούλονται, ἤδη καὶ φίλοι εἰσίν.	people are not healthy merely if they wish to be healthy, so that even if people wish to be friends they are not actually friends already.
ἔτι τοίνυν, εἰπεῖν τὸν Σωκράτη, ἀπόκριναι ὀλίγῳ πλείω, ἵνα μᾶλλον καταμάθῃς ὃ βούλομαι.	Then will you give me just a few more answers, said Socrates, so that you may the better grasp my meaning?
τοιοῦτόν τι ἔδει γίνεσθαι παρὰ τοῦ παιδευτοῦ πρὸς τοὺς εὐφυεῖς τῶν νέων.	Thus ought the case to stand between a preceptor and ingenuous young men.
χρήμασί γε μὴν οὐ μόνον δικαίως ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐλευθερίως ἐχρῆτο, τῷ μὲν δικαίῳ ἀρκεῖν ἡγούμενος τὸ ἐὰν τὰ ἀλλότρια, τῷ δὲ ἐλευθερίῳ καὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ προσωφελητέον εἶναι.	In the use of money he was not only just but generous, thinking that a just man may be content to leave other men’s money alone, but the generous man is required also to spend his own in the service of others.
καὶ χίμαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας, πλὴν τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως τῆς διὰ παντός· αἱ θυσίαι αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ σπονδαὶ αὐτῶν.	And one young he-goat from the goats for a sin offering, in addition to the perpetual whole burnt offering with their sacrifices and their drink offerings.
τὸ δὲ μέγα καὶ ἐξαίρετον ἄλλοις τάχα προσήκει, Σωκράτει καὶ τοῖς τοιούτοις.	But that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and such as are like him.
καὶ τῶν βοῶν σου πληθυνθέντων καὶ τῶν προβάτων σου πληθυνθέντων, ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου πληθυνθέντος σοι, καὶ πάντων ὅσων ἔσται σοι πληθυνθέντων σοι,	and your cattle increases and your sheep increase, your silver and gold increase, and all that ⌊you have⌋ is being multiplied,
διὰ μέντοι τὸ μέγεθος Γίγας ἐκαλεῖτο. ἐπὶ τούτοις Οὐιτέλλιος μὲν ἐπ' Ἀντιοχείας ᾔει, Ἀρτάβανος δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς Βαβυλωνίας. Ἡρώδης δὲ βουλόμενος δι' αὐτοῦ πρώτου γενέσθαι πύστιν Καίσαρι τῶν ὁμήρων τῆς λήψεως ἐκπέμπει γραμματοφόρους τὰ πάντα ἀκριβῶς γράψας εἰς ἐπιστολὴν καὶ μηδὲν ὑπολιπόμενος ἐπὶ μηνύσει τῷ ὑπατικῷ.	After this Vitellius went to Antioch and Artabanus to Babylon, but Herod wanting to be first to Caesar with the news that they had obtained hostages, sent him letter-bearers with an accurate written description of the whole affair and leaving nothing new for the proconsul to inform to report.
στρατηγὸς δὲ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς αἱρεθεὶς Καλπούρνιος Πίσων οὐδ’ ἤλασεν ἐπὶ Νομαντίαν, ἀλλ’ ἐς τὴν Παλλαντίων γῆν ἐσβαλών, καὶ μικρὰ δῃώσας, ἐχείμαζεν ἐν Καρπητανίᾳ τὸ ἐπίλοιπον τῆς ἀρχῆς.	Calpurnius Piso was chosen general against them, but he did not march against Numantia. He made an incursion into the territory of Pallantia, and having collected a small amount of plunder, spent the rest of his term of office in winter quarters in Carpetania.
ἀφίκοντο δὲ καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων πρέσβεις κατὰ τάχος, δοκοῦντες ἐπιτήδειοι εἶναι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις, Φιλοχαρίδας καὶ Λέων καὶ Ἔνδιος, δείσαντες μὴ τήν τε ξυμμαχίαν ὀργιζόμενοι πρὸς τοὺς Ἀργείους ποιήσωνται, καὶ ἅμα Πύλον ἀπαιτήσοντες ἀντὶ Πανάκτου καὶ περὶ τῆς Βοιωτῶν ξυμμαχίας ἀπολογησόμενοι, ὡς οὐκ ἐπὶ κακῷ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐποιήσαντο.	Thither also with all speed came the Lacedaemonian ambassadors, Philocharidas, Leon, and Endius, persons accounted most gracious with the Athenians, for fear, lest in their passion they should make a league with the Argives, and withal to require the restitution of Pylus for Panactum, and to excuse themselves concerning their league with the Boeotians, as not made for any harm intended to the Athenians.
ταῦτα δὲ συνᾴδειν ἀλλήλοις οὐδαμῶς δύναται·	Nothing can reconcile these statements.
ὁ γὰρ ἐπιστραφεὶς οὐ διὰ τὸ θεωρούμενον ἐσώζετο, ἀλλὰ διὰ σέ, τὸν πάντων σωτῆρα.	For the person who turned himself was saved, not because of what was beheld, but because of you, the savior of all.
λαβὼν δὲ καὶ περισκεψάμενος γνώμην εἶχεν παίσων ἑαυτόν, κἂν ἐπεπράχει μὴ φθάσαντος αὐτοῦ καταλαβεῖν τὴν δεξιὰν Ἀχιάβου· ἀνεψιὸς ἦν αὐτοῦ.	When he had got the knife, he looked about, and had a mind to stab himself with it and he had done it, had not his first cousin, Achiabus, prevented him, and held his hand, and cried out loudly.
Ἔνθα δὴ πολλὰ τῶν Ῥωμαίων κακοπαθούντων ὁ Πομπήιος τά τε ἄλλα τῆς καρτερίας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἀπεθαύμαζεν καὶ μάλιστα τοῦ μηδὲν παραλῦσαι: τῆς θρησκείας ἐν μέσοις τοῖς βέλεσιν ἀνειλημένους: ὥσπερ γὰρ εἰρήνης βαθείας κατεχούσης τὴν πόλιν αἵ τε θυσίαι καθ' ἡμέραν καὶ οἱ ἐναγισμοὶ καὶ πᾶσα θεραπεία κατὰ τἀκριβὲς ἐξετελεῖτο τῷ θεῷ, καὶ οὐδὲ κατ' αὐτὴν τὴν ἅλωσιν περὶ τῷ βωμῷ φονευόμενοι τῶν καθ' ἡμέραν νομίμων εἰς τὴν θρησκείαν ἀπέστησαν.	While the Romans toiled hard at this, Pompey had to admire not only the Jews' bravery but how they did not give up their religious services, even when showered with missiles from all sides. For, as if the city were fully at peace, their daily sacrifices and purifications and all aspects of their worship were still duly performed to God. Even when the temple was actually taken and they were being killed near the altar, they did not give up the forms of their daily worship appointed by the law.
ἢ ποῖὸς τίς ἐστιν ὁ τὸν ἑταῖρον ἐν φιλοφροσύναις καὶ γράμμασιν ἀδελφὸν προσαγορεύων, τῷ δ’ ἀδελφῷ μηδὲ τὴν αὐτὴν ὁδὸν οἰόμενος;	For what shall we make of that man who in his complaisance, either in company or in his letters, salutes his friend by the name of brother, and yet scorns the company of that very brother whose name was so serviceable to him in his compliment?
τὸ δὲ ἦν λύτρωσις σωμάτων τε καὶ κτημάτων.	its effect was to ransom persons and property.
οἳ γῆν μολόντες Ἑλλάδ’ οὐ θεῶν βρέτη ᾐδοῦντο συλᾶν οὐδὲ πιμπράναι νεώς:	For, on reaching the land of Hellas, restrained by no religious awe, they ravaged the images of the gods and set fire to their temples.
“Ἰώσηπος Ἰωνάθῃ καὶ τοῖς σὺν αὐτῷ χαίρειν.	"Josephus to Jonathan, and those that are with him, sendeth greeting.
Καὶ παρὰ μὲν Ἰουδαίοις ἔρις ἦν ὅστις προκινδυνεύσας χαρίσαιτο τοῖς ἡγεμόσιν, μάλιστα δὲ τοῦ Σίμωνος αἰδὼς ἦν καὶ δέος, οὕτως τε προσεῖχεν ἕκαστος αὐτῷ τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων, ὡς καὶ πρὸς αὐτοχειρίαν ἑτοιμότατος εἶναι κελεύσαντος:	The Jews rivalled each other in facing dangers in order to impress their officers. They revered and dreaded Simon above all, and regarded him so highly that his subjects were ready at his command even to kill themselves with their own hands.
ἐκείνη δὲ ὡς ἤκουσεν ἠγέρθη ταχὺ καὶ ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτόν.	So when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
τυχὼν δὲ ταύτης καὶ παραλαβὼν εὐφυέστατον καιρὸν μετὰ τὸν ἐκείνου θάνατον πρὸς τὸ συντηρῆσαι τὴν ἐξουσίαν, ἅμα τὰ πράγματα καὶ τὸ ζῆν ἀπέβαλε διὰ τὴν ἰδίαν ἀνανδρίαν καὶ ῥᾳθυμίαν, ἐν πάνυ βραχεῖ χρόνῳ καταγνωσθείς.	and though after his death he had the most favourable opportunity of consolidating his power, he yet soon fell into contempt, and lost his position and his life at once, thanks to his own want of courage and vigour.
τὸ σύνολον δὲ μάλιστά τις ἂν ἐκ ταύτης μάθοι τῆς ἱστορίας ἐθελήσας αὐτὴν διελθεῖν, ὅτι τοῖς μὲν θεοῦ γνώμῃ κατακολουθοῦσι καὶ τὰ καλῶς νομοθετηθέντα μὴ τολμῶσι παραβαίνειν πάντα κατορθοῦται πέρα πίστεως καὶ γέρας εὐδαιμονία πρόκειται παρὰ θεοῦ·	Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God but then it is to those that follow his will, and do not venture to break his excellent laws
τὸ δὲ δὴ ἔστι καὶ τὸ γίγνεται οὐ τοῦ νῦν παρόντος;	And is and is becoming in the present?
διὰ τί δίδαξόν με, τί ἐροῦμεν αὐτῷ· καὶ παυσώμεθα πολλὰ λέγοντες.	⌊Why⌋ teach me what I should say to him? And I may cease from saying many things.
ἄμμον θαλασσῶν καὶ σταγόνας ὑετοῦ καὶ ἡμέρας αἰῶνος τίς ἐξαριθμήσει;	Who will count the sands of the seas and the drops of rain and the days of eternity?
ὅταν ἀναβοήσῃς, ἐξελέσθωσάν σε ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου· τούτους γὰρ πάντας λήμψεται ἄνεμος καὶ ἀποίσει καταιγίς. οἱ δὲ ἀντεχόμενοί μου κτήσονται γῆν, καὶ κληρονομήσουσιν τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου,	When you shout aloud, let them rescue you in your affliction, for a wind will take all these people, and a storm will carry them off. But those who cleave to me will acquire the land and will inherit my holy mountain.
κἂν εὕρῃ τι τοιοῦτον, ἐπιτιμᾷ ἑαυτῷ καὶ ἐγκαλεῖ τί γάρ σοι καὶ τοῦτο εἰπεῖν;	If he should find anything of this sort, he rebukes and accuses himself. What business had you to say that?
καὶ Ἀχιὰ υἱὸς Ἀχιτὼβ ἀδελφοῦ Ἰωχαβὴλ υἱοῦ Φεινεὲς υἱοῦ Λευεὶ ἱερεὺς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν Σηλὼμ αἴρων ἐφούδ· καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι πεπόρευται Ἰωναθάν.	And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Levi, the priest of God at Shiloh, was carrying the ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had left.
Πορευομένων δὲ αὐτῶν, ἰδού, τινὲς τῆς κουστωδίας ἐλθόντες εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀπήγγειλαν τοῖς ἀρχιερεῦσιν ἅπαντα τὰ γενόμενα.	Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
καὶ καθάπερ ἀγγείων κενῶν ὑγρὸν δεχομένων ὁ ἐντὸς ἀὴρ ὑπέξεισιν ἐκθλιβόμενος, οὕτως ἀνθρώποις πληρουμένοις τῶν ἀληθινῶν ἀγαθῶν ἐνδίδωσιν ὁ τῦφος καὶ γίγνεται τὸ οἴημα μαλακώτερον, καὶ παυόμενοι τοῦ διὰ πώγωνα καὶ τρίβωνα φρονεῖν μέγα τὴν ἄσκησιν ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχὴν μεταφέρουσι, καὶ τῷ δηκτικῷ καὶ πικρῷ χρῶνται πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς μάλιστα, τοῖς δ’ ἄλλοις πραότερον ἐντυγχάνουσι.	And just as when empty vessels are being filled with a liquid the air inside is expelled by the pressure, so when men are being filled with the really good things, their conceit gives way and their self-opinion becomes less inflexible and, ceasing to feel pride in their philosopher’s beard and gown, they transfer their training to their mind, and apply their stinging and bitter criticism most of all to themselves, and are milder in their intercourse with others.
Ὤ Ζεῦ, ὁ κλῆρος οὐ πολὺν σῖτον παρέχει.	Oh Zeus, the farm does not provide much grain.
ἐν δὲ Βιθυνίᾳ πάλιν οὐκ ὀλίγα τῶν ἰδίων ἀπολέσας καὶ περικοπεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἐκεῖ Θρᾳκῶν, ἔγνω μὲν ἀναβαίνειν πρὸς Ἀρταξέρξην, ἑαυτόν τε μὴ χείρονα Θεμιστοκλέους πειρωμένῳ βασιλεῖ φανεῖσθαι νομίζων, καὶ κρείττονα τὴν πρόφασιν·	In Bithynia he again lost much of his substance, being plundered by the Thracians there, and so he determined to go up to the court of Artaxerxes. He thought to show himself not inferior to Themistocles if the King made trial of his services, and superior in his pretext for offering them.
ταῖς δὲ τῶν ποταμῶν πληρώσεσι καὶ τῷ τοὺς ἀπογαίους μὴ πνεῖν ὁμολογεῖ καὶ τὸ λεχθὲν ὑπὸ τοῦ Ὀνησικρίτου·	The account of Onesicritus confirms the facts of the rising of the rivers and of the absence of land breezes.
Καὶ διεστείλατο αὐτοῖς ἵνα μηδενὶ εἴπωσιν· ὅσον δὲ αὐτὸς αὐτοῖς διεστέλλετο, μᾶλλον περισσότερον ἐκήρυσσον.	Then He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it.
καὶ οἱ Ἕλληνες ἐνταῦθα ἀνέπνευσαν ἄσμενοι ἰδόντες πεδίον·	There the Greeks took breath, glad to behold a plain
καὶ πᾶσαι προθύμως αὐτὸν αἱ πόλεις Ἀλεξάνδρου κελεύσαντος ἐκδεχόμεναι παρέπεμπον ἕως Ἀζώτου πόλεως, ἔνθα πάντες κατεβόων αὐτοῦ περὶ τοῦ ἐμπεπρησμένου ἱεροῦ αὐτῶν Δαγῶνος κατηγοροῦντες Ἰωνάθου τοῦτο ἀφανίσαντος καὶ τὴν χώραν πυρπολήσαντος καὶ πολλοὺς αὐτῶν ἀποκτείναντος.	At Alexander's orders all the cities received him willingly and conducted him as far as Azotus, where they all loudly complained about the burning of the temple of Dagon, and accused Jonathan of ravaging it and destroying the adjoining country with fire and killing many people.
αἰτίη δὲ, τῶν ἀρχέων τῶν νεύρων ἡ ἐπαλλαγή. οὐ γὰρ κατ’ ἴξιν τὰ δεξιὰ ἐπὶ δεξιὰ ὁδοιπορέει, μέσφι περατῶνται, ἀλλ’ ἔμφυτα τῇ ἀρχῇ ἕκαστα εὐθὺς ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνα φοιτῇ, ἀλλήλοισι ἐπαλλαξάμενα εἰς χιασμὸν σχήματος·	The cause of this is the interchange in the origins of the nerves, for they do not pass along on the same side, the right on the right side, until their terminations but each of them passes over to the other side from that of its origin, decussating each other in the form of the letter X.
ἀλλ’ ἑτέραν τινὰ φυλακτέον ἐστὶ τούτοις δριμυτέραν ἐν γράμμασι καὶ μαθήμασι μικρολογίαν, ὑφ’ ἧς ἀφειδεῖν καὶ ἀμελεῖν τοῦ σώματος ἀναγκάζονται, πολλάκις ἀπαγορεύοντος οὐκ ἐνδιδόντες ἀλλὰ προσβιαζόμενοι θνητὸν ἀθανάτῳ καὶ γηγενὲς Ὀλυμπίῳ συναμιλλᾶσθαι καὶ συνεξανύτειν.	but these must guard against another and more subtle kind of pettiness that inheres in letters and learning, an influence which compels them to be unsparing and careless of their body, so that they oftentimes, when the body is ready to succumb, will not surrender, but will force the mortal to be partner with the immortal, and the earth-born with the celestial, in rivalry and achievement.
διὸ καλῶς ὁ Τιμόθεος, ἐπιδεικνυμένου ποτὲ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις τοῦ Χάρητος ὠτειλάς τινας ἐν τῷ σώματι καὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα λόγχῃ διακεκομμένην, ἐγὼ δέ, εἶπεν, ὡς λίαν ᾐσχύνθην ὅτι μου πολιορκοῦντος Σάμον ἐγγὺς ἔπεσε βέλος, ὡς μειρακιωδέστερον ἐμαυτῷ χρώμενος ἢ κατὰ στρατηγοῦ καὶ ἡγεμόνα δυνάμεως τοσαύτης.	Therefore Timotheus was right when Chares was once showing the Athenians some wounds he had received, and his shield pierced by a spear, in saying But I, how greatly ashamed I was, at the siege of Samos, because a bolt fell near me I thought I was behaving more like an impetuous youth than like a general in command of so large a force.
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἡγοῦμαι πόλιν πλείω ξύμπασαν ὀρθουμένην ὠφελεῖν τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἢ καθ’ ἕκαστον τῶν πολιτῶν εὐπραγοῦσαν, ἁθρόαν δὲ σφαλλομένην.	I am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of private citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public humiliation.
τειχίσας δ' ἐν κύκλῳ τὴν πόλιν καὶ πρὸς τὰς ἐπιδρομὰς τῶν πολεμίων πύργους οἰκοδομησάμενος ὑψηλοὺς φύλακας ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐγκατέστησεν, καὶ τὴν Βεθσούραν δὲ πόλιν ὠχύρωσεν, ὅπως ἀντὶ φρουρίου αὐτῇ πρὸς τὰς ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἀνάγκας ἔχῃ χρῆσθαι.	Judas also rebuilt the walls around the city and raised high towers against enemy attack and set guards in them. He also fortified the city of Bethsura, to serve as a citadel against any danger from our enemies.
καὶ οὐκ ἄξιον οὐδαμῇ τὰς ἐκ τῶν ὀπτανείων καὶ ματρυλείων ἡδονὰς ἐκείνας; παραβάλλοντας ταύταις καταισχύνειν τὸν Ἑλικῶνα καὶ τὰς Μούσας ἔνθ’ οὔτε ποιμὴν ἀξιοῖ φέρβειν βοτὰ οὔτ’ ἦλθέ πω σίδηρος·	And it doth in no wise beseem me, by comparing with these the fulsome debauchees of victualling-houses and stews, to contaminate Helicon and the Muses,— Where swain his flock ne’er fed, Nor tree by hatchet bled.
πανταχοῦ τὴν πρόφασιν βεβαιοῦσαν τὸ πρᾶγμ’ εὑρήσομεν.	Everywhere we shall find that it is the motive that fixes the character of the act.
μὴ οὖν ἀξιοῦτέ με, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, τοιαῦτα δεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς πράττειν ἃ μήτε ἡγοῦμαι καλὰ εἶναι μήτε δίκαια μήτε ὅσια, ἄλλως τε μέντοι νὴ Δία πάντως καὶ ἀσεβείας φεύγοντα ὑπὸ Μελήτου τουτουΐ.	Do not, therefore, men of Athens, demand of me that I act before you in a way which I consider neither honorable nor right nor pious, especially when impiety is the very thing for which Meletus here has brought me to trial.
ὁ ὀρύσσων βόθρον εἰς αὐτὸν ἐμπεσεῖται, καὶ ὁ ἱστῶν παγίδα ἐν αὐτῇ ἁλώσεται·	The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and the one who sets a trap will be caught in it.
ἀλλ' ἐπὶ τῆς μακαριζομένης λαμπρότητος." ταῦθ' ἅμα λέγων ἐπιτάσει τῆς ὀδύνης κατεπονεῖτο: μετὰ σπουδῆς οὖν εἰς τὸ βασίλειον ἐκομίσθη καὶ διῇξε λόγος εἰς πάντας, ὡς ἔχοι τοῦ τεθνάναι παντάπασι μετ' ὀλίγον.	As he said this, he gasped with pain and he was quickly carried into the palace, and the rumour went round that he was about to die.
πόθεν ἢ πῶς ἀξιωθέντι; ποῦ δὲ παιδείας σοὶ θέμις μνησθῆναι;	Where and how did you qualify as a moralist? Where did you get your right to talk about education?
ἔτι δ’ ἄσωτος ὁ πρὸς ἅπασαν δαπάνην ὑπερβάλλων, ἀνελεύθερος δὲ ὁ πρὸς ἅπασαν ἐλλείπων· ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὁ μικροπρεπὴς καὶ ὁ σαλάκων, ὁ μὲν γὰρ ὑπερβάλλει τὸ πρέπον, ὁ δ’ ἐλλείπει τοῦ πρέποντος·	Again, he that exceeds in all expenditure is prodigal, he that falls short in all, mean. Similarly the shabby man and the swaggererthe latter exceeds what is fitting and the former falls below it. The rascal grasps profit by every means and from every source, the simpleton does not make profit even from the proper sources.
ὁ δὲ προφήτης οὔθ’ ἕπεσθαι ἤθελεν οὔτ’ ἀλλαχόσε που μένειν, ἡδέως δ’ εἶχεν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐρειπίοις τῆς πατρίδος καὶ τοῖς ταλαιπώροις αὐτῆς διαζῆσαι λειψάνοις.	But the prophet had no mind to follow him, nor to dwell any where else, but would gladly live in the ruins of his country, and in the miserable remains of it.
αὐτοὶ δὲ ἠπείθησαν καὶ παρώξυναν τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐστράφη αὐτοῖς εἰς ἔχθραν, αὐτὸς ἐπολέμησεν αὐτούς.	But they rebelled and provoked his Holy Spirit, and he was turned to enmity against them; he himself made war with them.
Φιλήμονος γὰρ ἑταίρας ἐρασθέντος καὶ χρηστὴν ταύτην ὀνομάσαντος διὰ τοῦ δράματος , ἀντέγραψεν Μένανδρος ὡς οὐδεμιᾶς οὔσης χρηστῆς .	For when Philemon was in love with a courtesan, and in one of his plays called her Excellent, Menander, in one of his plays, said, in contradiction to this, that there was no courtesan who was good.
ὁ δὲ Στράτων φανερῶς ἐπικατέσφαξεν ἑαυτὸν τῇ παρθένῳ.	But Strato slew himself in sight of all upon the body of the maiden.
ἄπορος ἐπ’ οὐδὲν ἔρχεται τὸ μέλλον·	Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must come.
καὶ μὴ θαυμάσῃς, μήτ’ εἰ μακροτέραν γέγραφα τὴν ἐπιστολὴν μήτ’ εἴ τι περιεργότερον καὶ πρεσβυτικώτερον εἰρήκαμεν ἐν αὐτῇ·	And do not be surprised either if the letter I have written is too long, or if in it I have expressed myself in a somewhat too officious way and after the fashion of an old man
καθὼς ἐμὲ ἀπέστειλας εἰς τὸν κόσμον, κἀγὼ ἀπέστειλα αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν κόσμον.	Just as you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.
χώσας δὲ φορμοῖς ἀχύρων σεσαγμένοις τὰς τάφρους ἔλαθε τοὺς πολεμίους ἀπαγαγὼν ἀσφαλῶς τὴν δύναμιν.	He started about midnight from the town with his mercenary troops, and having choked up the trenches with baskets stuffed full of chaff, led off his force in safety, without being detected by the enemy.
ὅτι ἡ Παλλήνη χερρόνησος, ἧς ἐν τῷ ἰσθμῷ κεῖται ἡ πρὶν μὲν Ποτίδαια νῦν δὲ Κασσάνδρεια, Φλέγρα τὸ πρὶν ἐκαλεῖτο·	EPIT. Pallene is a peninsula. On the isthmus of Pallene lies what was once Potida, but now Cassandra.
Φιλόχορος δέ φησι προτελευτῆσαι τὸν Εὐριπίδην τοῦ Σωκράτους.	but Philochorus asserts that Euripides died before Socrates.
Τίτος δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς ἐπὶ θαλάττῃ Καισαρείας ἀναζεύξας εἰς τὴν Φιλίππου καλουμένην Καισάρειαν ἧκε συχνόν τ’ ἐν αὐτῇ χρόνον ἐπέμεινεν παντοίας θεωρίας ἐπιτελῶν καὶ πολλοὶ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ἐνταῦθα διεφθάρησαν, οἱ μὲν θηρίοις παραβληθέντες, οἱ δὲ κατὰ πληθὺν ἀλλήλοις ἀναγκαζόμενοι χρήσασθαι πολεμίοις.	But as for Titus, he marched from that Cesarea which lay by the sea-side, and came to that which is named Cesarea Philippi, and staid there a considerable time, and exhibited all sorts of shows there. And here a great number of the captives were destroyed, some being thrown to wild beasts, and others in multitudes forced to kill one another, as if they were their enemies.
Λάμεχος δὲ ἄρξας ἑπτὰ καὶ ἑπτακοσίοις ἔτεσι Νῶχον τῶν πραγμάτων ἀποδείκνυσι προστάτην υἱόν, ὃς Λαμέχῳ γενόμενος ὄγδοον καὶ ὀγδοηκοστὸν καὶ ἑκατοστὸν ἔτος ἠνυκότι πεντήκοντα καὶ ἐνακοσίοις ἔτεσιν ἦρξε τῶν πραγμάτων.	Now Lamech, when he had governed seven hundred and seventy-seven years, appointed Noah, his son, to be ruler of the people, who was born to Lamech when he was one hundred and eighty-two years old, and retained the government nine hundred and fifty years.
διὸ δὴ καὶ ὁ μέν τις δίνην περιτιθεὶς τῇ γῇ ὑπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ μένειν δὴ ποιεῖ τὴν γῆν, ὁ δὲ ὥσπερ καρδόπῳ πλατείᾳ βάθρον τὸν ἀέρα ὑπερείδει·	And so one man makes the earth stay below the heavens by putting a vortex about it, and another regards the earth as a flat trough supported on a foundation of air
ὅδε γὰρ εὖ φρονεῖν δοκήσας πάλιν ἄπεισιν οἴκαδ᾽ αὖ, ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθῶ μὲν τοῖς πολίταις, ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθῷ δὲ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ ξυγγενέσι τε καὶ φίλοισι, διὰ τὸ συνετὸς εἶναι.	for this man of proven good sense will go back home again for the good of his citizens, for the good of his own relatives and friends, on account of being intelligent.
ἐὰν ταῦτα φυλάξῃς καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν πᾶσαν ἀλήθειαν λαλήσῃς, δυνήσῃ σεαυτῷ ζωὴν περιποιήσασθαι:	If you keep these things and from henceforth keep the whole truth, you can obtain life for yourself
καὶ πολλὰς μὲν ὑφέντος ἐνέδρας οὐδεμιᾷ περιπεσών, ἐν δὲ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀκροβολισμοῖς πλεῖον ἔχων ἐθαυμάζετο.	And though his adversary laid many ambushes for him, he escaped them all, and by getting the advantage of him in all the skirmishes, won admiration for himself.
Τίς ἄν με θείη κατὰ μῆνα ἔμπροσθεν ἡμερῶν ὧν με ὁ θεὸς ἐφύλαξεν;	“Who might have put me in the month, before the days in which God watched over me?
ἠφανισμένου δὲ καὶ τούτου τοῦ πλήθους μάλιστα ὑπὸ τοῦ Εὐεργέτου τοῦ Φύσκωνος, καθ’ ὃν ἧκεν εἰς τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρειαν ὁ Πολύβιος καταστασιαζόμενος γὰρ ὁ Φύσκων πλεονάκις τοῖς στρατιώταις ἐφίει τὰ πλήθη καὶ διέφθειρε, τοιούτων δή, φησίν, ὄντων τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει λοιπὸν ἦν τῷ ὄντι τὸ τοῦ ποιητοῦ Αἴγυπτόνδ’ ἰέναι δολιχὴν ὁδὸν ἀργαλέην τε.	But this class was extinct nearly about the time of Euergetes Physcon, in whose reign Polybius came to Alexandreia. For Physcon, being distressed by factions, frequently exposed the multitude to the attacks of the soldiery, and thus destroyed them. By such a state of things in the city the words of the poet (says Polybius) were verified The way to Egypt is long and vexatious.
εἰ παῖδά γ’ εἶδες χεῖρας ἐκτείνοντά μοι.	Hadst thou but seen the babe stretch forth his hands to me!
φόβος Κυρίου εἰς ζωὴν ἀνδρί, ὁ δὲ ἄφοβος αὐλισθήσεται ἐν τόποις οὗ οὐκ ἐπισκοπεῖται γνῶσις.	The fear of the Lord leads to life for a man, but the fearless will lodge in places where knowledge is not examined.
πρὸς τοῦτον οὖν πέμψαντες ἠξίουν αὐτὸν συμμαχεῖν ἐπαγγελλόμενοι παρασχεῖν εἰς ἅπαντ’ αὐτῷ τὸν χρόνον τὴν ἰδίαν ἡγεμονίαν.	the Israelites therefore sent to him, and entreated him to come to their assistance, and promised him the dominion over them all his lifetime.
καὶ τίς ἡμῶν οὐ χαίρει τῇ πανηγύρει ταύτῃ καὶ ὀδυνώμενος αὐτῆς ἀπαλλάσσεται;	and who of us is not pleased with this assembly, and leaves it unwillingly?
ἆρ’ οὖν, ἔφη, καί, περὶ οὗ διαλεγόμεθα, οἶσθά τινας οἳ ἀνωφελεῖς ὄντες ὠφελίμους δύνανται φίλους ποιεῖσθαι;	Coming then to the point under discussion, do you know cases of useless persons making useful friends?Assuredly not
Διὰ ταῦθ' Ἡρώδην μὲν ὠνείδιζεν ἡ Μαριάμμη, καὶ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα δειναῖς ἐξύβριζεν λοιδορίαις. ἀλλ' ὁ μὲν πεφίμωτο τοῖς ἱμέροις, δεινὴ δὲ τὰς γυναῖκας ἀγανάκτησις εἰσήιει, καὶ πρὸς ὃ μάλιστα κινήσειν τὸν Ἡρώδην ἔμελλον, εἰς μοιχείαν διέβαλλον αὐτήν,	For these reasons Mariamne spoke out scornfully against Herod and his sister and mother, while he stayed silent due to his fondness for her. The women were furious with her and accused her of adultery, which they thought most likely to move Herod to anger.
ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν λαοί, ὁ θεός, ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν λαοὶ πάντες.	Let the peoples give thanks, O God; let all the peoples give thanks.
πολλῷ οὖν κάλλιόν ἐστι τοιοῦτόν τινα εἶναι τὴν ἰδέαν ἢ ὥς φησιν Ἀντιφάνης ἐν Αἰόλῳ · τοῦτον οὖν δι’ οἰνοφλυγίαν καὶ πάχος τοῦ σώματος ἀσκὸν καλοῦσι πάντες οὑπιχώριοι.	At all events, it is much better to look like that, than to be like the man of whom Antiphanes in his Aeolus says— This man then, such a sot and glutton is he, And so enormous is his size of body, Is called by all his countrymen the Bladder.
ἰσχύει δὲ οὐκ αἰεὶ τωὐτό, ἀλλὰ ἄλλοτε ἄλλο κατὰ τὰ πνεύματα·	But the strongest is not always the same sometimes it is one, sometimes another, according to the winds.
αἰσχύνθητι, Σειδών, εἶπεν ἡ θάλασσα· ἡ δὲ ἰσχὺς τῆς θαλάσσης εἶπεν Οὐκ ὤδινον οὐδ᾽ ἔτεκον, οὐδὲ ἐξέθρεψα νεανίσκους οὐδὲ ὕψωσα παρθένους.	“Be ashamed, Sidon,” said the sea; and the strength of the sea said, “I did not have pangs or give birth or rear young men or raise maidens.”
οἱ δέ μιν ἠΰτε γλαῦκα πέρι σπίζαι τερατοῦντο ἠλέματον δεικνύντες, ὁθούνεκεν ὀχλοάρεσκος.	And they were amazed at him, like chaffinches about an owl, pointing him out as vain, because he was a flatterer of the mob.
ἀλλὰ καὶ παρακαλῶ συνείξαντάς μοι τῆς ἐμῆς ἀπολαῦσαι φιλίας· δυναίμην γὰρ ὥσπερ κολάζειν τοὺς ἀπειθοῦντάς μου τοῖς ἐπιτάγμασιν, ⸆ οὕτως καὶ εὐεργετεῖν τοὺς εὐπειθοῦντάς μοι.	but also I encourage you to yield to me to enjoy my friendship. For just as I would be able to punish the ones who disobey my commands, in the same way also I would be able to do good to the ones who show obedience to me.
ποσσὶ δ’ ὕπ’ ἀθανάτοισι μέγας πελεμίζετ’ Ὄλυμπος ὀρνυμένοιο ἄνακτος· ἐπεστενάχιζε δὲ γαῖα.	Great Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat.
νῦν δὲ ὁρᾷς ὅτι τρεῖς ὄντες ὑμεῖς, οἵπερ σοφώτατοί ἐστε τῶν νῦν Ἑλλήνων, σύ τε καὶ πῶλος καὶ Γοργίας, οὐκ ἔχετε ἀποδεῖξαι ὡς δεῖ ἄλλον τινὰ βίον ζῆν ἢ τοῦτον, ὅσπερ καὶ ἐκεῖσε φαίνεται συμφέρων.	but as it is, you observe that you three, who are the wisest of the Greeks in our day—you and Polus and Gorgias— are unable to prove that we ought to live any other life than this, which is evidently advantageous also in the other world.
εἰ γάρ, ὦ φίλε Ἀδείμαντε, τὰ τοιαῦτα ἡμῖν οἱ νέοι σπουδῇ ἀκούοιεν καὶ μὴ καταγελῷεν ὡς ἀναξίως λεγομένων, σχολῇ ἂν ἑαυτόν γέ τις ἄνθρωπον ὄντα ἀνάξιον ἡγήσαιτο τούτων καὶ ἐπιπλήξειεν, εἰ καὶ ἐπίοι αὐτῷ τι τοιοῦτον ἢ λέγειν ἢ ποιεῖν, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν αἰσχυνόμενος οὐδὲ καρτερῶν πολλοὺς ἐπὶ σμικροῖσιν παθήμασιν θρήνους ἂν ᾄδοι καὶ ὀδυρμούς.	For if, dear Adeimantus, our young men should seriously incline to listen to such tales and not laugh at them as unworthy utterances, still less surely would any man be to think such conduct unworthy of himself and to rebuke himself if it occurred to him to do or say anything of that kind, but without shame or restraint full many a dirge for trifles would he chant and many a lament.
τούς τε ἄλλους Σικελιώτας οὕτως ἤδη μᾶλλον καὶ ἐκείνοις οὐ ξυμμαχήσειν καὶ σφίσι προσιέναι καὶ οὐ διαμελλήσειν περισκοποῦντας ὁπότεροι κρατήσουσιν.	and the other Sicilians would then neglect leaguing with the Syracusians, and join with the Athenians, no longer standing off and spying who should have the better.
καὶ κυκλεύσαντες ἑπτὰ ἡμερῶν ὁδὸν εἰς ἀπορίαν ὕδατος τοῖς τε κτήνεσι καὶ τῇ στρατιᾷ περιέστησαν πλανηθέντων τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῖς τῶν ἡγουμένων, ὡς ἀγωνιᾶν μὲν ἅπαντας, μάλιστα δὲ τὸν Ἰώραμον καὶ ὑπὸ λύπης ἐκβοῆσαι πρὸς τὸν θεόν, τί κακὸν αἰτιασάμενος ἀγάγοι τοὺς τρεῖς βασιλεῖς ἀμαχητὶ παραδώσοντας ἑαυτοὺς τῷ Μωαβιτῶν βασιλεῖ;	When they had gone a circuitous seven days' journey, they were in short of water for the livestock and for the army due to a mistaken direction taken by the guides leading them, so all were struggling, especially Joram, who in his grief cried out to God, asking what wrong they had done to make him hand over the three kings to the king of Moab, without a fight.
εἰ δ’ ἐγὼ καὶ σὺ ἦμεν, εὐθὺς ἂν καταφιλοσοφήσαντες ὅτι τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας δεῖ τοῖς ἴσοις ἀμύνεσθαι καὶ προσθέντες ὅτι ὄφελος ἔσομαι πολλοῖς ἀνθρώποις σωθείς, ἀποθανὼν δ’ οὐδενί, εἰ ἄρ’ ἔδει διὰ τρώγλης ἐκδύντας, ἐξήλθομεν ἄν.	But if you and I had been in his place, we should have immediately answered as philosophers that those who act unjustly must be repaid in the same way, and we should have added, I shall be useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die, I shall be useful to no man. For, if it had been necessary, we should have made our escape by slipping through a small hole.
Θεόφραστος δ’ ἐν Θάσῳ φησὶ τὸν ἐν τῷ πρυτανείῳ διδόμενον θαυμαστὸν εἶναι τὴν ἡδονὴν ἠρτυμένος γάρ ἐστιν.	But Theophrastus says, that the wine at Thasos, which is given in the prytaneum, is wonderfully delicious for it is well seasoned
οὐκοῦν τὸ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦν ἦν ἡ ψυχὴ τῶν τοῦ σώματος ἐναντίων ἕξεων, τὸ δὲ τὴν ἀλγηδόνα ἤ τινα διὰ πάθος ἡδονὴν τὸ σῶμα ἦν τὸ παρεχόμενον;	And was not the soul that which desired the opposites of the conditions of the body and the body that which caused pleasure or pain because of feeling?
τί γὰρ ἄλλο ἢ ἵνα σε κοσμήσῃ ἢ ἵνα δείξῃς ἔργῳ δι’ αὐτοῦ, τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος τῷ βουλήματι τῆς φύσεως παρακολουθῶν;	Why, what else than that it shall do you honour, or that it shall show you by act through it, what a man is who follows the will of nature?
τήν τε Πελοπόννησον πᾶσιν ἔφασαν ἀναχώρησίν τε καὶ ἀφορμὴν ἱκανὴν εἶναι.	and that Peloponnese would suffice for all as a base both for retreat and offence.
ὡς ὁ Πρίαμος ἔρρετε, λωβητῆρες, ἐλεγχέες· οὔ νυ καὶ ὑμῖν ἔστι γόος, ὅτι μ’ ἤλθετε κηδήσοντες;	— Be gone, ye upbraiding scoundrels, haven’t ye at home Enough, that to help bear my grief ye come?
καὶ Μυρωνίδης γὰρ ἦν τραχὺς ἐντεῦθεν μελάμπυγός τε τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἅπασιν, ὥς δὲ καὶ Φορμίων.	so much myronides' fierce beard and thundering black back were feared, that the foe fled when they were shown - brave he as phormion.
ταύτας Τισσαφέρνης Κύρῳ ἐπεγγελῶν διαρπάσαι τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἐπέτρεψε πλὴν ἀνδραπόδων.	And Tissaphernes, by way of insulting Cyrus, gave over these villages—save only the slaves they contained—to the Greeks to plunder.
οὐδενὶ δὲ ὅπλων διαλλάττουσιν οἱ περὶ τὸν στρατηγὸν ἔκκριτοι τῶν ἐν ταῖς ἴλαις ἱππέων.	And for those that are chosen to be about the general, their armor no way differs from that of the horsemen belonging to other troops
τὸ δὲ δόντας ἐμοὶ τὴν ἄδειαν ἀφελέσθαι ὑμᾶς, εὖ ἴστε ὅτι οὐδεπώποτε ἠγανάκτησα·	The fact that you deprived me of the pardon which you had given me has never, I assure you, caused me to feel aggrieved.
πρὸς Οὐιτελλίου δὲ ἐπιπεμφθεισῶν ἐπιστολῶν καὶ τοῦ Καίσαρος ἐπισημήναντος πρὸς αὐτόν, ὡς δῆλα αὐτῷ γένοιτο πρότερον πύστιν περὶ αὐτῶν Ἡρώδου προτεθεικότος, ταραχθεὶς ὁ Οὐιτέλλιος μεγάλως καὶ πεπονθέναι μειζόνως ἢ ἐπέπρακτο ὑπολαμβάνων ἄδηλον τὴν ἐπ' αὐτοῖς ἔκρυπτεν ὀργήν, μέχρι δὴ καὶ μετῆλθε Γαίου τὴν Ῥωμαίων ἀρχὴν παρειληφότος.	When Vitellius's letters were sent and Caesar had told him that he knew about the affair, since Herod had already written of it, Vitellius was furious, thinking it a bigger offence than it really was, but kept his anger secret until he got his revenge, which he did when Gaius took over as Roman emperor.
‘ἀλλ’ ἔτι καὶ νῦν, ὦ πάντων ἀξυνετώτατοι, εἰ μὴ μανθάνετε κακὰ σπεύδοντες, ἢ ἀμαθέστατοί ἐστε ὧν ἐγὼ οἶδα Ἑλλήνων, ἢ ἀδικώτατοι, εἰ εἰδότες τολμᾶτε.	But yet, O ye the most unwise of all men, unless you know that what you affect is evil, and if you know not that, you are the most ignorant of all the Grecians I know or, ye most wicked of all men, if knowing it you dare do this.
εἰκὸς δὲ μὴ δυσπείστους εἶναι αὐτοὺς τὰ τοιαῦτα, οἵ γε φυλαρχεῖν ἐπεθύμησαν δόξης καὶ τιμῆς ὀρεγόμενοι, δυνατοὶ δ’ εἰσὶ τὰ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ πορίσαι καὶ ἄνευ τοῦ αὐτοὶ δαπανᾶν τῷ μισθῷ ἐπαναγκάζοντες κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὁπλίζεσθαι.	It is likely that they will not be hard to persuade in such matters, considering that honour and glory were the attractions that the colonelcy held out to them, and they can arm the men in accordance with the regulations laid down in the law without incurring expense themselves, afterwards compelling the men to spend their pay on their arms, as the law ordains.
τῶν δὲ πάντα περὶ ἀσφαλείας καὶ τοῦ μηδὲν νεωτερίσειν ὑποσχομένων, εἰ μίαν αὐτοῖς καταλείποι σπεῖραν, μὴ μέντοι τὴν μαχεσαμένην·	Hereupon they promised that they would make no innovations, in case he would leave them one band
ἐνταυθοῖ μὲν γὰρ καὶ τὸ τοιοῦτον ἕν, ὅπερ εἴπομεν νυνδή, συγκεχώρηται τὸ μὴ δεῖν ἐλέγχειν·	For in cases of a unity of that sort, as I just said, it is agreed that refutation is needless.
εἰς δὲ τὰς ἀποδημίας ὁπότε στέλλοιτο, τέσσαρσι τῶν συμμαχίδων πόλεων ὥσπερ θεραπαίναις ἐχρῆτο.	And whenever he went on a journey he used four of the allied cities as his maid-servants.
ἐν δὲ τούτῳ τῷ καιρῷ ἀφικνοῦμαι ἐγὼ ἐκ Πειραιῶς, καὶ τρέπομαι παριὼν ὡς τὸν Λυσίμαχον·	At this moment I arrived from the Peiraeus, and in passing I turned into Lysimachus’s house
ἄνδρες δ’ ἐγένοντο λόγου ἄξιοι δύο ῥήτορες ἀδελφοὶ Ἀλαβανδεῖς, Μενεκλῆς τε οὗ ἐμνήσθημεν μικρὸν ἐπάνω καὶ Ἱεροκλῆς, καὶ οἱ μετοικήσαντες εἰς τὴν Ῥόδον ὅ τε Ἀπολλώνιος καὶ ὁ Μόλων.	Natives of Alabanda, distinguished persons, were two orators, brothers, Menecles, whom we mentioned a little above, and Hierocles, Apollonius, and Molo the two latter afterwards went to Rhodes.
καὶ ἐπορεύετο κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐνιαυτὸν καὶ ἐκύκλου Βαιθὴλ καὶ τὴν Γάλγαλα καὶ τὴν Μασσηφάθ, καὶ ἐδίκαζεν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις τούτοις.	And he went ⌊year by year⌋ in a circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah. He judged Israel in all these consecrated places.
ἴδιον δὲ τὸ συσσίτιά τινα Λακωνικὰ αὐτοῖς εἶναι δημοσίᾳ σιτουμένων ὄψα δ’ ἐκ θήρας ἐχόντων, καὶ τὸ χρυσῷ μὴ χρῆσθαι μηδ’ ἀργύρῳ μετάλλων ὄντων, καὶ τὸ ἀντὶ δούλων τοῖς ἐν ἀκμῇ χρῆσθαι νέοις, ὡς Κρῆτες μὲν τοῖς Ἀφαμιώταις Λάκωνες δὲ τοῖς Εἴλωσι·	to have a kind of Lacedmonian common meal, where they eat in public. Their food consists of what is taken in the chase. They make no use of gold nor silver, although they have mines of these metals. Instead of slaves, they employed youths in the flower of their age, as the Cretans employ the Aphamiot, and the Lacedmonians the Helots.
ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς τῆς πτώσεως αὐτοῦ ἐσείσθησαν τὰ ἔθνη, ὅτε κατεβίβαζον αὐτὸν εἰς ᾅδου μετὰ τῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς λάκκον, καὶ παρεκάλουν αὐτὸν ἐν γῇ πάντα τὰ ξύλα τῆς τρυφῆς καὶ τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ τοῦ Λιβάνου, πάντα τὰ πίνοντα ὕδωρ.	The nations were shaken by the sound of his fall, when I was bringing him down into Hades with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of delight, and the choice ones of Lebanon, all that drink water, were consoling him in the land.
πῦρ γὰρ θάμνου βάτων νεμόμενον τὴν περὶ αὐτὸν χλόην τό τε ἄνθος αὐτοῦ παρῆλθεν ἀβλαβὲς καὶ τῶν ἐγκάρπων κλάδων οὐδὲν ἠφάνισε καὶ ταῦτα τῆς φλογὸς πολλῆς καὶ ὀξυτάτης ὑπαρχούσης.	A fire fed on a thorn bush, yet its green foliage and flowers continued and the fire did not at all consume its fruiting branches, though the flame was hot and fierce.
ἔπηλυς ἢ τὸ γένος ἐγχώριος;	foreigners, or those of that country?
τὸ δ’ ἄλλο πᾶν΄, ὅσον ἐν ταῖς φλεψὶ καὶ τῇ γαστρὶ περιέχεται, μέλλον.	and to everything else- that is, contained in the stomach and veins- the name of destined nutriment.
ἵνα μηκέτι ὦμεν νήπιοι κλυδωνιζόμενοι καὶ περιφερόμενοι παντὶ ἀνέμῳ τῆς διδασκαλίας ἐν τῇ κυβείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐν πανουργίᾳ πρὸς τὴν μεθοδείαν τῆς πλάνης,	So we are no longer to be children, tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching by the trickery of people who craftily carry out their deceitful schemes.
‘ὁρῶν ὑμᾶς, ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιῶται, πεφοβημένους τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἐναντίων ξυνεκάλεσα, οὐκ ἀξιῶν τὰ μὴ δεινὰ ἐν ὀρρωδίᾳ ἔχειν.	Soldiers, having observed your fear of the enemy's number, I have called you together, not enduring to see you terrified with things that are not terrible.
διὰ τοῦτο Ἀγριππῖνος Φλώρῳ σκεπτομένῳ, εἰ καταβατέον αὐτῷ ἐστιν εἰς Νέρωνος θεωρίας, ὥστε καὶ αὐτόν τι λειτουργῆσαι, ἔφη κατάβηθι.	For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether he should go down to Nero’s spectacles, and also perform in them himself, Agrippinus said to him, Go down
ἧσσον μὲν οὖν ταῦτα τότε εἰκὸς ἦν πάσχειν διὰ τὴν συνήθειαν, ἰσχυρῶς δὲ καὶ τότε.	Formerly indeed they probably suffered less, because they were used to it, but they suffered severely even then.
οὕτω σφόδρα ζηλότυπος ὁ νεανίσκος ἦν.	he was so jealous that he beat me the whole of that day.
Διὰ τοῦτο καὶ μᾶλλον ἐξέβαινεν τῶν πατρίων ἐθῶν καὶ ξενικοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν ὑποδιέφθειρεν τὴν πάλαι κατάστασιν ἀπαρεγχείρητον οὖσαν, ἐξ ὧν οὐ μικρὰ καὶ πρὸς τὸν αὖθις χρόνον ἠδικήθημεν ἀμεληθέντων ὅσα πρότερον ἐπὶ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἦγεν τοὺς ὄχλους·	ON this account it was that Herod revolted from the laws of his country, and corrupted their ancient constitution, by the introduction of foreign practices, which constitution yet ought to have been preserved inviolable by which means we became guilty of great wickedness afterward, while those religious observances which used to lead the multitude to piety were now neglected
καὶ δέξαιντ’ ἂν μικρὰν εἶναι τὴν πόλιν μᾶλλον ἢ δι’ ἄλλους μεγάλην καὶ ἐλευθέραν,	And they would sooner have the city diminished than raised to greatness and freedom by others
τοιαῦτ’ ἐκείνων ἐστὶ τἀξευρήματα.	Such are the inventions fixed to their shields.
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν ἀποδείξειεν οὐδείς, ὡς 〈ἐν〉 μὲν τῷ τοιούτῳ καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐμπεριελήφθη τὰ τοιαῦτα σπέρματα, ἐξ ὧν ζῷά τε καὶ φυτὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ πάντα 〈τὰ〉 θεωρούμενα συνίσταται, ἐν δὲ τῷ τοιούτῳ οὐκ ἂν ἐδυνήθη.	For nobody can prove that in one sort of world there might not be contained, whereas in another sort of world there could not possibly be, the seeds out of which animals and plants arise and all the rest of the things we see.
ἀλλ’ ὅσῳ βεβαιότερον κρίνουσι τὰ οὐκ ὄντα, τοσούτῳ πλείονος ἐλλεβόρου δέονται.	but the more firmly they form a judgment on things which do not exist, the more ellebore they require.
καθόλου δ’ ἀεί τι νέον καὶ καινὸν προσεξεύρισκον, εἰς ἀδύνατον ἐκβάλλοντες τὴν διάλυσιν διὰ τὸ πολλοὺς καχέκτας καὶ στασιώδεις ἐν αὐτοῖς ὑπάρχειν.	And in short, the ill-disposed and mutinous among them being numerous, they always found out some new demand which made it impossible to come to terms.
τὸ δὲ τὰ αὐτὰ πάσχον καὶ τὰ αὐτὰ ἀνταποδιδὸν ἀεί, κύκλον οὕτω σαλευόμενον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα ἀπειργασμένον ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέρων τὴν ἀναπνοὴν καὶ ἐκπνοὴν γίγνεσθαι παρέχεται.	and thus the air, by continually undergoing and transmitting the same affections, causes inspiration and expiration to come about as a result of this double process, as it were a wheel that oscillates backwards and forwards.
τῷ δ’ ἀπείρῳ μήτε ἀρχὴν ἔχοντι μήτε πέρας οὐ προσήκει μέσον ἔχειν·	and infiniteness having neither beginning nor end, it is convenient also that it should not have any middle
τούτων δ’ ὅσαι μὲν ὁμωνύμως λέγονται δυνάμεις ἀφείσθωσαν ἔνιαι γὰρ ὁμοιότητί τινι λέγονται, καθάπερ ἐν γεωμετρίᾳ καὶ δυνατὰ καὶ ἀδύνατα λέγομεν τῷ εἶναί πως ἢ μὴ εἶναι, ὅσαι δὲ πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ εἶδος, πᾶσαι ἀρχαί τινές εἰσι, καὶ πρὸς πρώτην μίαν λέγονται, ἥ ἐστιν ἀρχὴ μεταβολῆς ἐν ἄλλῳ ἢ ᾗ ἄλλο.	All senses which are merely equivocal may be dismissed for some are used by analogy, as in geometry, and we call things possible or impossible because they "are" or "are not" in some particular way. But the potentialities which conform to the same type are all principles, and derive their meaning from one primary sense of potency, which is the source of change in some other thing, or in the same thing qua other. One kind of potentiality is the power of being affected
ἄμφω δὲ φωνὴν ἥσομεν Παρνησσίδα, γλώσσης ἀυτὴν Φωκίδος μιμουμένω.	Both of us will speak the speech of Parnassus, imitating the accent of a Phocian tongue.
Τιβερίῳ δὲ Ἀλεξάνδρῳ Κουμανὸς ἀφίκετο διάδοχος.	and Cumanus came as successor to Tiberius Alexander.
καὶ τοῦτο μᾶλλον ἴσχυσε τῶν ἀρχαίων ὀνομάτων, ᾧ καὶ ἡμεῖς χρησόμεθα τὸν λοιπὸν βίον τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἱστοροῦντες.	This name prevailed over the older names which he had borne, and it is the name which I shall use for him in the remainder of this Life.
Εἶπεν δὲ Μαριάμ, Ἰδού, ἡ δούλη κυρίου· γένοιτό μοι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ' αὐτῆς ὁ ἄγγελος.	Then Mary said, "Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
ἐνώπιον ἀλλοτρίου μὴ ποιήσῃς κρυπτόν, οὐ γὰρ γινώσκεις τί τέξεται.	Do no secret thing in front of a stranger, for you do not know what he will reveal.
αὐτοὶ δὲ τὰ περὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς τὸν ξύλλογον ἡτοιμάζοντο, Εὐρυμέδων μὲν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πλεύσας καὶ πέντε καὶ δέκα τε ναῦς πληροῦν κελεύσας αὐτοὺς καὶ ὁπλίτας καταλεγόμενος ξυνῆρχε γὰρ ἤδη Δημοσθένει ἀποτραπόμενος, ὥσπερ καὶ ᾑρέθη, Δημοσθένης δ’ ἐκ τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἀκαρνανίαν χωρίων σφενδονήτας τε καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς ξυναγείρων.	Of whom Eurymedon went to Corcyra, and having appointed them there to man fifteen galleys, levied men of arms for now giving over his course to Athens, he joined with Demosthenes, as having been elected with him in the charge of general and Demosthenes took up slingers and darters in the parts about Acarnania.
οὐ γὰρ ἕδρα μὲν ἔστι καὶ στάσις τοῦ κρείττονος, κατάκλισις δ’ οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδὲ προπίεται ἑτέρῳ πρὸ ἑτέρου μᾶλλον ὁ ἑστιῶν, περὶ δὲ τὰς κατακλίσεις παρόψεται τὰς διαφοράς, εὐθὺς ἐν ἀρχῇ τὴν λεγομένην μίαν Μύκονον ἀποφήνας τὸ συμπόσιον.	or that the entertainer should in civility drink to one before another, and yet make no difference in their seats, at the first dash making the whole company one Myconus (as they say), a hodge-podge and confusion.
εὖ φρονεῖν δ’ ὑμᾶς ὑπολαμβάνων μισεῖν αὑτὸν ἡγεῖται.	Assuming that you are intelligent, he concludes that you hate him.
ἦ καὶ τὸν ζωγράφον δημιουργὸν καὶ ποιητὴν τοῦ τοιούτου;	Shall we also say that the painter is the creator and maker of that sort of thing?
καὶ ὑμεῖς ὅμοιοι ἀνθρώποις προσδεχομένοις τὸν κύριον ἑαυτῶν πότε ἀναλύσῃ ἐκ τῶν γάμων, ἵνα ἐλθόντος καὶ κρούσαντος εὐθέως ἀνοίξωσιν αὐτῷ.	be like people waiting for their master to come back from the wedding celebration, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.
ψυχὴ γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ἀπαγγέλλειν ἐνίοτε εἴωθεν ἢ ἑπτὰ σκοποὶ ἐπὶ μετεώρου καθήμενοι ἐπὶ σκοπῆς.	For the soul of a man is sometimes accustomed to announce more than seven watchmen upon a lofty place, sitting upon a watchtower.
τὰ δὲ κατὰ κίνησιν τὸ γὰρ ἐγγύτερον τοῦ πρώτου κινήσαντος πρότερον, οἷον παῖς ἀνδρός·	(c) In another sense, in respect of motion (for that which is nearer to the prime mover is prior e.g., the boy is prior to the man).
φαιὸν γὰρ καὶ λευκὸν ἅμα τῷ αὐτῷ οὐχ ὑπάρχει·	"Grey" and "white" do not apply at the same time to the same thing, and hence their constituents are opposite.
ἐπὶ γὰρ ἐγχύσι κοτὲ φλέγματος ἀνέγροντο ἐκ τοῦ ζόφου.	for by the discharge of phlegm they are sometimes roused from their gloom.
κατέστησαν δὲ καὶ πρεσβευτὰς πρὸς Ἄτταλον τοὺς περὶ Τηλόκριτον, ἀποκομίζοντας τὸ δόγμα τὸ περὶ τῆς ἀποκαταστάσεως τῶν Εὐμένους τιμῶν.	The Achaeans also appointed Telocritus to conduct an embassy to Attalus, bearing the decree concerning the restoration of the honours of Eumenes.
τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον οὕτως ἐταπείνωσε τὴν γνώμην τοῦ βασιλέως, ὥστε συνθέσθαι τὴν περιβόητον εἰρήνην ἐκείνην, ἵππου μὲν δρόμον ἀεὶ τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς ἀπέχειν θαλάσσης, ἔνδον δὲ Κυανέων καὶ Χελιδονίων μακρᾷ νηῒ καὶ χαλκεμβόλῳ μὴ πλέειν.	This exploit so humbled the purpose of the King that he made the terms of that notorious peace, by which he was to keep away from the Hellenic sea-coast as far as a horse could travel in a day, and was not to sail west of the Cyanean and Chelidonian isles with armored ships of war.
θυίσκαι χρυσαῖ δώδεκα, πλήρεις θυμιάματος· πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον τῶν θυισκῶν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν χρυσοῖ.	There were twelve gold censers, full of fragrant incense; all the gold of the censers was ⌊a hundred and twenty⌋ gold shekels.
τὰ γὰρ ἱερὰ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἀκροπόλει † καὶ ἄλλων θεῶν ἐστὶ καὶ τὰ ἔξω πρὸς τοῦτο τὸ μέρος τῆς πόλεως μᾶλλον ἵδρυται, τό τε τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Ὀλυμπίου καὶ τὸ Πύθιον καὶ τὸ τῆς Γῆς καὶ τὸ 〈τοῦ〉 ἐν Λίμναις Διονύσου, ᾧ τὰ ἀρχαιότερα Διονύσια τῇ δωδεκάτῃ ποιεῖται ἐν μηνὶ Ἀνθεστηριῶνι, ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ ἀπ’ Ἀθηναίων Ἴωνες ἔτι καὶ νῦν νομίζουσιν.	and even those that are outside it are mostly situated in this quarter of the city, as that of the Olympian Zeus, of the Pythian Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in the Marshes, the same in whose honor the older Dionysia are to this day celebrated in the month of Anthesterion not only by the Athenians but also by their Ionian descendants.
εἰ δὲ δή τις ἀφέμενος τῶν ἄλλων ἔροιτό με τί τούτων μεγίστην ἔχει δύναμιν πρὸς τὴν τῶν λόγων παιδείαν, ἀποκριναίμην ἂν ὅτι τὸ τῆς φύσεως ἀνυπέρβλητόν ἐστι καὶ πολὺ πάντων διαφέρει·	If anyone, ignoring the other arts, were to ask me which of these factors has the greatest power in the education of an orator I should answer that natural ability is paramount and comes before all else.
λοιμοῦ δὲ κατασχόντος Ῥωμαίους, ἔχρησεν ὁ Πύθιος λωφήσειν, ἐὰν ἐξιλάσωνται τοῦ Κρόνου τὴν μῆνιν καὶ τοὺς δαίμονας τῶν ἀνόμως; ἀπολομένων.	Upon a time, when the plague was very hot in Rome, the Pythian oracle being consulted gave this answer, that upon the appeasing the wrath of Saturn, and the Manes of those that were unjustly killed, the pestilence would cease.
ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν ἕτοιμός εἰμι τῷ πεῖραν εἰληφέναι δι’ αὐτῶν τῶν πραγμάτων ὡς εὐμετάθετός ἐστιν ἡ τύχη καὶ παρὰ μικρὸν εἰς ἑκάτερα ποιεῖ μεγάλας ῥοπάς, καθά περ εἰ νηπίοις παισὶ χρωμένη·	I personally am ready to do this, because I have learnt by actual experience that Fortune is the most fickle thing in the world, and inclines with decisive favour now to one side and now to the other on the slightest pretext, treating mankind like young children.
ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ πέραν βωμὸν ἱδρῦσθαι τοὺς ἀπολυθέντας οὐ μεθ' ἧς ἐκεῖνοι γνώμης ἀνέστησαν αὐτόν, ἀλλ' ἐπὶ νεωτερισμῷ καὶ ξενικῶν εἰσαγωγῇ θεῶν, οὐκ ἤθελον ἀπιστεῖν, ἀλλὰ περὶ θείαν θρησκείαν τὴν διαβολὴν πιθανὴν νομίζοντες ἐν ὅπλοις ἦσαν, ὡς ἐπ' ἀμύνῃ τῶν τὸν βωμὸν ἱδρυσαμένων περαιωσόμενοι τὸν ποταμὸν καὶ κολάσοντες αὐτοὺς τῆς παρατροπῆς τῶν πατρίων ἐθῶν.	When those on the other [western] side heard how those they had sent away had built an altar, but did not hear with what intention they built it, they supposed it to be by way of novelty and to introduce foreign gods.
ἆρ’ οὖν καὶ ἕτεροί τινές εἰσιν, οἳ μηδέτερα τούτων πεπόνθασιν;	And are there any others besides, who are found to be in neither state?
ἀλλ᾽ ἀμυδρῶς ταύτας, καὶ τρόπον μέν τινα πᾶσαι πρότερον εἴρηνται τρόπον δέ τινα οὐδαμῶς.	and although in one sense they have all been stated before, in another they have not been stated at all.
οὐδαμῶς, ἔφη ὁ Σιμμίας. καὶ μήν, ἦ δ’ ὅς, πρέπει γε εἴπερ τῳ ἄλλῳ λόγῳ συνῳδῷ εἶναι καὶ τῷ περὶ ἁρμονίας. πρέπει γάρ, ἔφη ὁ Σιμμίας. οὗτος τοίνυν, ἔφη, σοὶ οὐ συνῳδός·	So how can you bring this theory into harmony with the other?I cannot at all, said Simmias.And yet, said Socrates, there ought to be harmony between it and the theory about harmony above all others.Yes, there ought, said Simmias.Well, said he, there is no harmony between the two theories.
ὅρα οὖν ἄγων με τί ἀπολογήσῃ, ὡς ἐγὼ μὲν οὐχ ὁμολογήσω ἄκλητος ἥκειν, ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ σοῦ κεκλημένος.	Be sure, then, to have your excuse quite ready when you bring me for I shall not own to coming unasked, but only on your invitation.
ὁ δὲ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν δεδεκάτωκεν Ἀβραάμ· καὶ τὸν ἔχοντα τὰς ἐπαγγελίας εὐλόγηκεν.	But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who possessed the promise.
ἀὴρ δὲ πληγεὶς ἐν ἀκοῇ γίγνεται φωνὴ καὶ ψόφος.	Now the air being struck upon is a voice and sound to the ear
τὸ μὲν γὰρ αὑτοῦ τὰς πλεκτάνας κατεσθίειν αὐτὸν ψεῦδός ἐστιν· τὸ δὲ μύραιναν δεδιέναι καὶ γόγγρον ἀληθές ἐστιν·	Now the story that it eats its own tentacles is a lie, but it is true that it fears the moray and the conger.
εἰ δὲ καὶ ὅπως τὸ ἐν Δελφοῖς ἱερὸν αὐτόνομον ὥσπερ πρόσθεν γένοιτο φανεροὶ εἴητ’ ἐπιμελούμενοι, μὴ συμπολεμοῦντες ἀλλὰ πρεσβεύοντες ἀνὰ τὴν Ἑλλάδα, ἐγὼ μὲν οὐδὲν ἂν οἶμαι θαυμαστὸν εἶναι, εἰ καὶ πάντας τοὺς Ἕλληνας ὁμογνώμονάς τε καὶ συνόρκους καὶ συμμάχους λάβοιτε ἐπ’ ἐκείνους, οἵτινες ἐκλιπόντων Φωκέων τὸ ἱερὸν καταλαμβάνειν πειρῷντο.	And were it apparent that you are striving to make the Delphic shrine independent, as it used to be, not by joining in war, but by sending embassies up and down Greece, I for my part should not be in the least surprised if you found the Greeks all of one mind, banded together by oath and united in alliance against any that attempted to seize the shrine in the event of the Phocians abandoning it.
ἂν μέντοι ἐκτρέφειν ἐᾷς τὴν γῆν διὰ τέλους τὸ σπέρμα εἰς καρπόν, χαλεπὸν τῇ ἀσθενεῖ γῇ ἐς τέλος πολὺν καρπὸν ἐκφέρειν.	If, on the other hand, you let the seed go on growing on the land until it is bolled, it’s hard for weak land to yield much grain in the end.
οἱ δὲ νόμοι καὶ τούτων διδόασι τὰς παραγραφὰς ἀντιλαγχάνειν, περὶ ὧν οὐκ εἰσὶν εἰσαγωγεῖς.	And the laws grant the filing of pleas to bar action also in case of charges brought before magistrates who have not due competency.
ἔχων μὲν τοίνυν ἣν ἐπείσθη τῶν αὑτοῦ τιμήν, δεηθεὶς δ’ ἐμοῦ τὸ γενέσθαι πρατῆρα καθ’ ὃ συνέβαλον ἀργύριον, αὑτὸς δυοῖν ταλάντοιν προσδικάζεται.	He has, then, received the sum which he agreed to take for his property,—he even begged me that I should assume the position of vendor for the sum which I had advanced—yet this same man sues me for two talents more.
ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οὐδέν πω λέγω περὶ οὐδενὸς οὐδ’ αἰτιῶμαι, οὐδ’ ἀναγκασθέντ’ αὐτῶν οὐδένα δεῖ δοκεῖν χρηστὸν εἶναι τήμερον, ἀλλὰ δι’ αὑτὸν καὶ τὸ μὴ κεκοινωνηκέναι τῶν ἀδικημάτων.	For the moment, I have nothing to say of them by way of fault-finding. They may all show themselves honest men today, not by compulsion but of their own free will, and as having no share in those iniquities.
Ὦ βασιλέως λογισμοὶ βασιλικώτεροι καὶ ἐλευθέρων ἐλευθερώτεροι·	O reason, more royal than kings and more free than a freeman.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ κρίνων τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰδοὺ εἴληφα ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου τὸ ποτήριον τῆς πτώσεως, τὸ κόνδυ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, καὶ οὐ προσθήσῃ ἔτι πιεῖν αὐτό·	This is what the Lord God who judges his people says: “Look! I have taken the cup of collapse from your hand, the vessel of my wrath, and ⌊you will no longer continue⌋ to drink it;
κἀν τοῖς ἐπιγραφομένοις δὲ Ἀγαθοῖς ὁ Φερεκράτης ἢ Στράττις φησίν · λουσάμενοι δὲ πρὸ λαμπρᾶς ἡμέρας ἐν τοῖς στεφανώμασιν, οἳ δ’ ἐν τῷ μύρῳ λαλεῖτε περὶ σισυμβρίων κοσμοσανδάλων τε. καὶ Κρατῖνος ἐν Μαλθακοῖς ·	And also, in the poem which is entitled The Good Men, Pherecrates or Strattis, whichever is the author, says— And having bathed before the heat of day, Some crown their head and some anoint their bodies. And he speaks of thyme, and of cosmosandalum.
καίτοι, ὦ ἄνδρες, οἱ ἡμέτεροι πρόγονοι οἱ ταῦτα κτησάμενοι καὶ καταλιπόντες πάσας μὲν χορηγίας ἐχορήγησαν, εἰσήνεγκαν δὲ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον χρήματα πολλὰ ὑμῖν, καὶ τριηραρχοῦντες οὐδένα χρόνον διέλιπον.	And yet, gentlemen, our forefathers, who acquired and bequeathed this property, performed every kind of choregic office, contributed large sums for your expenses in war, and never ceased acting as trierarchs.
οὔτε γὰρ τὰ νῦν δίκαια πράσσεις οὔθ’ ἃ πρόσθεν εἴργασαι.	Your present deed is not just, nor the deed which you have done.
οἷσι δὲ τὸ τοιοῦτον, οὐκ ἔτι Ῥηΐδιον ἐς τὴν ἑωυτοῦ φύσιν ἀγαγεῖν· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἄλλην οὐδεμίην Ῥηΐδιον ξυμφυάδα κοινὴν δύο ὀστέων κινηθεῖσαν ἐς τὴν ἀρχαίην φύσιν ἱδρυνθῆναι, ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη ὄγκον ἴσχειν τὴν διάστασιν.	In such a case it is not easy to reduce the parts to their natural state, nor is it easy, in the separation of any two bones united by symphysis, to restore them to their natural state, for there will necessarily be a swelling at the seat of the diastasis.
καὶ ἀνέγνωσαν ἔξω νόμον, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο ὁμολογίας· ἀναγγείλατε ὅτι ταῦτα ἠγάπησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός.	And they read the law outside, and they invoked confessions. You announced, because the children of Israel loved these things,” says the Lord God.
εἰ ναυμαχοῖεν κᾆτ᾽ ἔχοντες ὀξίδας ῥαίνοιεν ἐς τὰ βλέφαρα τῶν ἐναντίων.	if there were a sea battle, and then they had bottles of vinegar, they could squirt them in the enemies' eyes.
ὅσοι δὲ τῶν στρατιωτῶν ὑπ’ ἀσωτίας ἀναλώκεσαν τὰ πεπορισμένα, ἡγούμενοι τῶν μὲν πόνων οὐδὲν ἄξιον ηὑρῆσθαι παρὰ τὸ μηδὲν ἔχειν, σφετερίζεσθαι δ’ αὐτῶν τὰ ἔργα καὶ τὴν δόξαν Σκιπίωνα, ἀφίσταντο ἀπὸ τοῦ Μαρκίου καὶ ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν ἐστρατοπέδευον.	Some of the soldiers, who had squandered their means in riotous living, and who thought that because they had nothing they had found no fit compensation for their toils, but that Scipio was appropriating all the glory of their deeds, seceded from Marcius and went off and encamped by themselves.
ἄγε δή, ὦ Ἀριαῖε, ἐπείπερ ὁ αὐτὸς ὑμῖν στόλος ἐστὶ καὶ ἡμῖν, εἰπὲ τίνα γνώμην ἔχεις περὶ τῆς πορείας, πότερον ἄπιμεν ἥνπερ ἤλθομεν ἢ ἄλλην τινὰ ἐννενοηκέναι δοκεῖς ὁδὸν κρείττω.	And now, Ariaeus, since you and we are to make the same journey, tell us what view you hold in regard to the route—shall we return by the same way we came, or do you think you have discovered another way that is better?
ἐξηράνθη ὡσεὶ ὄστρακον ἡ ἰσχύς μου, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσά μου κεκόλληται τῷ λάρυγγί μου, καὶ εἰς χοῦν θανάτου κατήγαγές με.	My strength was dried up like an earthen vessel, and my tongue has been glued to my throat. You led me into the dust of death.
πολλὰ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθ᾽ ἴθυσε μάχη πεδίοιο  ἀλλήλων ἰθυνομένων χαλκήρεα δοῦρα  μεσσηγὺς Σιμόεντος ἰδὲ Ξάνθοιο ῥοάων.	and often to this side and to that surged the battle over the plain, as they aimed one at the other their bronze-tipped spears between the Simoïs and the streams of Xanthus.
μέλλων δὲ Κράσσος εἰς Συρίαν ἀπαίρειν ἐβούλετο τὸν Κικέρωνα μᾶλλον αὐτῷ φίλον ἢ ἐχθρὸν εἶναι· καί φιλοφρονούμενος ἔφη βούλεσθαι δειπνῆσαι παρ’ αὐτῷ·	When Crassus was about to set out for Syria, wishing that Cicero should be a friend rather than an enemy, he said to him in a friendly manner that he wished to dine with him
οἱ δὲ Ῥόδιοι, τὰς μὲν ἀναδησάμενοι τῶν νεῶν, τὰς δὲ προδιαφθείραντες ταῖς ἐμβολαῖς, ἀπέπλευσαν εἰς τὴν Χίον.	So the Rhodians, taking in tow some of their vessels, and having destroyed others by charging them, sailed away to Chios.
ἔτι τοίνυν περὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους Διοπείθης ἐμβαλὼν εἰς τὴν χώραν Κρωβύλην μὲν καὶ τὴν Τιρίστασιν ἐξηνδραποδίσατο, τὴν δὲ προσεχῆ Θρᾴκην ἐπόρθησε, τέλος δ’ εἰς τοῦτ’ ἦλθε παρανομίας ὥστ’ Ἀμφίλοχον ὑπὲρ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ἐλθόντα πρεσβευτὴν συλλαβὼν καὶ τὰς ἐσχάτας ἀνάγκας ἐπιθεὶς ἀπελύτρωσε ταλάντων ἐννέα·	Furthermore, about the same date, Diopithes attacked Crobyle and Tiristasis and enslaved the inhabitants, laying waste the adjacent parts of Thrace. But his crowning act of lawlessness was the arrest of Amphilochus, the ambassador sent to negotiate for the captives he subjected him to the severest torture and wrung from him a ransom of nine talents.
ἐδόκει δ’ ἀμφοτέροις ἐς πολλὰ συνοίσειν ὁ θάνατος, γυναίου φιλοπράγμονος ἀπηλλαγμένοις, ἣ διὰ τὸν Κλεοπάτρας ζῆλον ἐξερρίπισε τοσόνδε πόλεμον.	The death of this turbulent woman, who had stirred up so disastrous a war on account of her jealousy of Cleopatra, seemed extremely fortunate to both of the parties who were rid of her.
Ἰσάκῳ δὲ μετὰ τὴν Ἁβράμου τελευτὴν ἐκύει τὸ γύναιον, καὶ τῆς γαστρὸς ἐπὶ μεῖζον ὀγκουμένης ἀγωνιάσας ἀνήρετο τὸν θεόν.	NOW Isaac's wife proved with child, after the death of Abraham and when her belly was greatly burdened, Isaac was very anxious, and inquired of God
τοῦτο οὖν εὔλογον μύξας γίνεσθαι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ;	Do you say it is unreasonable that there should be such a discomfort in the world?
ὧν δὴ καὶ δύο ὑπέταξα καὶ βουληθέντι σοι τὰ γεγραμμένα γνῶναι πάρεστιν ἐξ αὐτῶν·	two of which letters I have here subjoined, and thou mayst thereby know their contents
ὅπως γε μὲν καταδάρθοι οὐδ’ ἂν εἴποι τις ὅσα πραγματεύονται.	and the trouble his lackeys take that he may sleep is indescribable.
ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐχὶ λέγηθ’ ἐμαυτόν, οὐδ’ ἀγνοῶ, οὐ τῶν εὖ πεφυκότων κατὰ ταῦτ’ ὢν ἀνθρώπων, οὐδὲ τῶν λυσιτελούντως ἑαυτοῖς.	I am perfectly aware—I am not blind to the fact—that I am not one of those favored by nature in these respects, nor of those who are an advantage to themselves.
οὕτως ἐξ ἅπαντος οἱ τῆς θεοσεβείας ἐχθροὶ τὸ δοκεῖν ἠνυκέναι περὶ πολλοῦ ἐτίθεντο.	so great store ffid the enemies of ess set on seemingly by any means to have omplished their purpose.
ἀλλὰ μὰ τοὺς θεούς, ἐγὼ μὲν οὐθὲν ἂν ἔχοιμί σοι εἰπεῖν, ὦ Σώκρατες, οὕτως·	Well, by the gods, I could not answer your question, Socrates, offhand.
ἐκπίπτει δὲ πλειστάκις ἔσω, ἀτὰρ καὶ ἔξω καὶ ὄπισθεν.	It is most frequently dislocated inward, but also outward and backward.
καὶ μὴν περὶ λόγου γε ὁ αὐτὸς λόγος, εἴπερ ἐξ ὀνομάτων καὶ ῥημάτων σύγκειται, μηδὲν ἱκανῶς βεβαίως εἶναι βέβαιον·	Moreover, the same account holds good of the Definition also, that, inasmuch as it is compounded of names and verbs, it is in no case fixed with sufficient firmness.
τοῦ τοιούτου δ᾽ ἄτακτα καὶ ἄπειρα τὰ αἴτια.	clearly none of the traditional sciences concerns itself with the accidental
πᾶς γὰρ ἰατρὸς καὶ πᾶς ἔντεχνος δημιουργὸς παντὸς μὲν ἕνεκα πάντα ἐργάζεται, πρὸς τὸ κοινῇ συντεῖνον βέλτιστον μέρος μὴν ἕνεκα ὅλου καὶ οὐχ ὅλον μέρους ἕνεκα ἀπεργάζεται·	For every physician and every trained craftsman works always for the sake of a Whole, and strives after what is best in general, and he produces a part for the sake of a whole, and not a whole for the sake of a part
ὅθεν ἔμοιγε καὶ θαυμάζειν ἔπεισι τοὺς τὴν ἀθεότητα φάσκοντας ἀσέβειαν εἶναι, μὴ φάσκοντας δὲ τὴν δεισιδαιμονίαν.	Hence it occurs to me to wonder at those who say that atheism is impiety, and do not say the same of superstition.
κατὰ γὰρ πόλιν ἑκάστην, ὅσαι τοῖς αὐτοῖς χρῶνται περὶ τὴν δίαιταν, ἦν τούτων ἐπιμελόμενος καὶ κατὰ τὸ τῶν ἀφικνουμένων πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔθος πάντ' αὐτοῖς παρεσκευάζετο, ἵνα τῷ συνήθει τρόπῳ τῆς διαίτης εὐωχούμενοι μᾶλλον ἥδωνται καὶ πρὸς μηδὲν ὡς ἀλλοτρίως ἔχοντες δυσχεραίνωσιν.	He took care that people from any city who followed a distinctive lifestyle should have everything prepared for them according to the visitor's custom, so that, being feasted according to their customary lifestyle, they would be better pleased and not distressed by having to cope with anything to which they were naturally averse.
φίλιππόν τε τῆς συμμαχίας ἀμειβόμενοι, τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῷ Δημήτριον, ὁμηρεύοντα ἔτι παρὰ σφίσιν, ἔπεμψαν.	To Philip, in return for his services as an ally, they sent his son Demetrius, who was still a hostage in their hands.
Εἰπέ μοι ποίας σπορᾶς καὶ ποίου γένους ὑπάρχεις.	Tell me of what seed and of what race thou art.
ἐν οἷς αὐτὸν μέν φησιν ἐξ Ἑλλήνων μετατεθεῖσθαι, τὸν δ’ Ἀμμώνιον ἐκ βίου τοῦ κατὰ θεοσέβειαν ἐπὶ τὸν ἐθνικὸν τρόπον ἐκπεσεῖν.	where he says that Origen came over from the Greeks, and that Ammonius lapsed from a godly life into paganism.
οὐ δυνήσῃ φαγεῖν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσίν σου τὸ ἐπιδέκατον τοῦ σίτου σου καὶ τοῦ οἴνου σου καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου σου, τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν βοῶν σου, καὶ πάσας εὐχὰς ὅσας ἂν εὔξησθε καὶ τὰς ὁμολογίας ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν χειρῶν σου·	In your cities you shall not be able to eat the tithe of your grain and of your wine and of your oil, the firstborn of your cattle and any votive offerings that you may have vowed and your agreements and the first fruits your hands.
πολλὰ γὰρ καὶ ἐν τοῖς καθ’ ἕκαστα τυγχάνει τῆς προσηκούσης διαίτης, ὅσα γεωγραφικά·	There are, however, many particulars relating to Geography, which we shall bring under discussion
ἐκεῖνος ἄνω μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἀναβιώσας εὐφρανθήσεται εἰς τὸν ἀλύπητον αἰῶνα.	he shall live again with the fathers above, and rejoice to an eternity wherein is no sorrow.
δεῖ μὴν ἁμῶς γέ πως, καὶ ταῦτα οὐ φαύλους ἀλλ’ ὅτι μάλιστα ἄκρους.	Yet somehow or other they must be there—and men, too, of no mean quality, but of the highest quality possible.
αὐτὸ γὰρ τοῦτο τεκμήριον οὐκ ἐλάχιστόν ἐστι τοῦ ψευδῆ τὴν διαμαρτυρίαν γεγενῆσθαι, τὸ περὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ πράγματος μὴ τὸν αὐτὸν ἀμφισβητεῖν.	This very thing is the strongest proof of the falsehood of the affidavit—that it is not the same person who makes the claim about the same matter.
ὁ δ' Ἰωνάθης φήσας ἑτοίμως ἔχειν ἀποθνήσκειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν καὶ νομισθεὶς κατὰ μηδὲν εἶναι χείρων τἀδελφοῦ στρατηγὸς ἀποδείκνυται τῶν Ἰουδαίων.	When Jonathan declared that he was ready to die for them and was seen as no less than his brother, he was appointed general of the Jews.
εἰ δέ τινες ταῦτα ἐκπονήσαντες πρίν τινα καρπὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν κομίσασθαι περιεῖδον αὑτοὺς γήρᾳ ἀδυνάτους γενομένους, ὅμοιον ἔμοιγε δοκοῦσι πεπονθέναι οἷον εἴ τις γεωργὸς ἀγαθὸς προθυμηθεὶς γενέσθαι καὶ εὖ σπείρων καὶ εὖ φυτεύων, ὁπότε καρποῦσθαι ταῦτα δέοι, ἐῴη τὸν καρπὸν ἀσυγκόμιστον εἰς τὴν γῆν πάλιν καταρρεῖν.	But when men go through all this toil and then allow themselves to become old and feeble before they reap any fruit of their labours, they seem to me at least to be like a man who, anxious to become a good farmer, should sow and plant well but, when harvest time came, should permit his crop to fall back again to the ground ungathered.
καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης, καλῶς, ἔφη, ἐποίησας προειπών·	You have done well to tell me in advance, said Astyages
πόλεις δ’ ἐπὶ μὲν τῇ θαλάττῃ μετὰ τὴν Σινόεσσαν Λίτερνον, ὅπου τὸ μνῆμα τὸ Σκιπίωνος τοῦ πρώτου προσαγορευθέντος Ἀφρικανοῦ·	The maritime cities [of Campania], after Sinuessa, are Liternum, where is the sepulchral monument of the first of the two Scipios, surnamed Africanus
ἡμᾶς δὲ τοὺς περὶ τοῦ παντὸς λόγους ποιεῖσθαί πῃ μέλλοντας, ᾗ γέγονεν ἢ καὶ ἀγενές ἐστιν, εἰ μὴ παντάπασι παραλλάττομεν, ἀνάγκη θεούς τε καὶ θεὰς ἐπικαλουμένους εὔχεσθαι πάντα κατὰ νοῦν ἐκείνοις μὲν μάλιστα, ἑπομένως δὲ ἡμῖν εἰπεῖν.	we therefore who are purposing to deliver a discourse concerning the Universe, how it was created or haply is uncreate, must needs invoke Gods and Goddesses (if so be that we are not utterly demented), praying that all we say may be approved by them in the first place, and secondly by ourselves.
οὔτε γὰρ παῖδες ἡμῖν ἦσαν οὔτ’ ἄλλοι συγγενεῖς, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνος καὶ γένει προσήκων ἐγγυτάτω καὶ τῇ χρείᾳ πάντων ἦν οἰκειότατος·	for we had no children or other relatives, but he was a next-of-kin and most closely bound to us by ties of affection
καὶ νὴ Δί᾽ ἢν ἴδῃ γέ που γεγραμμένον υἱὸν Πυριλάμπους ἐν θύρᾳ Δῆμον καλόν, ἰὼν παρέγραψε πλησίον " κημὸς καλός. " τὸν ἀλεκτρυόνα δ᾽, ὃς ᾖδ᾽ ἀφ᾽ ἑσπέρας, ἔφη ὄψ᾽ ἐξεγείρειν αὐτὸν ἀναπεπεισμένον, παρὰ τῶν ὑπευθύνων ἔχοντα χρήματα. εὐθὺς δ᾽ ἀπὸ δορπηστοῦ κέκραγεν ἐμβάδας, κἄπειτ᾽ ἐκεῖσ᾽ ἐλθὼν προκαθεύδει πρῲ πάνυ, ὥσπερ λεπὰς προσεχόμενος τῷ κίονι. ὑπὸ δυσκολίας δ᾽ ἅπασι τιμῶν τὴν μακρὰν ὥσπερ μέλιττ᾽ ἢ βομβυλιὸς εἰσέρχεται ὑπὸ τοῖς ὄνυξι κηρὸν ἀναπεπλασμένος.	if he sees scribbled on some doorway, " how charming is demos, the son of pyrilampes! " he will write beneath it, " how charming is cemos! " his cock crowed one evening; said he, " he has had money from the accused to awaken me too late. as soon as he rises from supper he bawls for his shoes and away he rushes down there before dawn to sleep beforehand, glued fast to the column like an oyster. he is a merciless judge, never failing to draw the
ὅθεν ὁ Οὐρίατθος οὐ δοκιμάζων αὐτῷ συμπλέκεσθαι διὰ τὴν ὀλιγότητα, κατὰ μέν τινα φάραγγα ἀφανῆ τὸ πλέον τοῦ στρατοῦ περιέπεμψεν ἀπιέναι, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν αὐτὸς ἐκτάξας ἐπὶ λοφου δόξαν παρεῖχε πολεμήσοντος.	Viriathus deeming it unwise to engage in battle, on account of the smallness of his army, ordered the greater part of it to retreat through a hidden defile, while he drew up the remainder on a hill as though he intended to fight.
ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οἶμαι κἂν καταλεύσαντας αὐτοὺς ταῖς ἑαυτῶν χερσὶν καθαροὺς ἔσεσθαι νομίζειν.	I conceive that they would account even those who should stone them to death with their own hands to be free of all bloodguiltiness.
Ἀριστοφάνης Δαιδάλῳ · καὶ ταῦτ’ ἔχοντα πουλύπους καὶ σηπίας.	Aristophanes, in his Dædalus, says— When then I had this polypus (πουλύπους) and cuttle-fish.
Ἐτεοκλέους μὲν οὕνεκ’ ἂν κλῄσας στόμα χρησμοὺς ἐπέσχον· σοὶ δ’, ἐπεὶ χρῄζεις μαθεῖν, λέξω.	For Eteocles I would have closed my lips and refrained from all response, but to you I will speak, since it is your wish to learn.
ἀμφιβόλως δ’ εἴρηται τὸ παρὰ τῷ Ξενοφῶντι ἐν πρώτῳ Παιδείας .	But the word is used in an ambiguous sense by Xenophon, in the first book of his Cyropædia.
τινὲς δὲ ἀπὸ Ἐφύρας τῆς Θεσπρωτίδος ἀπογόνους Ἀντίφου καὶ Φειδίππου, τῶν Θετταλοῦ τοῦ Ἡρακλέους, ἐπελθόντας ἀπὸ Θετταλοῦ τοῦ ἑαυτῶν προγόνου τὴν χώραν ὀνομάσαι.	But, according to some writers, it was the descendants of Antiphus and Pheidippus, sons of Thettalus, descended from Hercules, who invaded the country from Ephyra in Thesprotia, and called it after the name of Thettalus their progenitor.
ἀνὰ μέσον γὰρ Θήρας καὶ Θηρασίας ἐκπεσοῦσαι φλόγες ἐκ τοῦ πελάγους ἐφ’ ἡμέρας τέτταρας, ὥστε πᾶσαν ζεῖν καὶ φλέγεσθαι τὴν θάλατταν, ἀνεφύσησαν κατ’ ὀλίγον ἐξαιρομένην ὡς ἂν ὀργανικῶς συντιθεμένην ἐκ μύδρων νῆσον ἐπέχουσαν δώδεκα σταδίων τὴν περίμετρον.	For midway between Thera and Therasia flames rushed forth from the sea for the space of four days causing the whole of it to boil and be all on fire and after a little an island twelve stadia in circumference, composed of the burning mass, was thrown up, as if raised by machinery.
ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἄζυμα ἔδεσθε, ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς πρώτης ἀφανιεῖτε ζύμην ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ὑμῶν· πᾶς ὃς ἂν φάγῃ ζύμην, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς πρώτης ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς ἑβδόμης.	Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and so from the first day you will remove leaven from your houses. Every one who eats leaven, that person will be utterly destroyed from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.
οὐ γὰρ τὰ ἐκ τῶν βιβλίων τοσοῦτόν με ὠφελεῖν ὑπελάμβανον δάον τὰ παρὰ ζώσης φωνῆς καὶ μενούσης. ” Ἔνθα καὶ ἐπιστῆσαι ἄξιον δὶς καθαρθμιοῦντι αὐτῷ τὸ Ἰωάννου ὄνομα, ὧν τὸν μὲν πρότερον Πέτρῳ καὶ Ἰακώβῳ καὶ Ματθαίῳ καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς ἀποστόλοις συγκαταλέγει, σαφῶς δηλῶν τὸν εὐαγγελιστήν, τὸν δ’ ἕτερον Ἰωάννην, διαστείλας τὸν λόγον, ἑτέροις παρὰ τὸν τῶν ἀποστόλων ἀριθμὸν κατατάσσει, προτάξας αὐτοῦ τὸν Ἀριστίωνα, σαφῶς τε αὐτὸν πρεσβύτερον ὀνομάζει·	For I did not suppose that information from books would help me so much as the word of a living and surviving voice.” It is here worth nothing that he twiee counts the name of John, and reckons the first John with Ρeter and James and Matthew and the other Αpostles, clearly the the evangelist, but by changing his statement Ρlaces the seeond with the others outside the number of the Αpostles, putting Αristion Before him and clearly calling him a presbyter.
κυβερνήτης δὲ νοήσας αὐτίκα οἷς ἑτάροισιν ἐκέκλετο φώνησέν τε·	Then the helmsman understood all and cried out at once to his fellows and said
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο διενοήθη μὴ μόνον ἐν αὑτῷ ποτ’ ἂν γενέσθαι ταύτην τὴν διάνοιαν, ἣν αὐτὸς ὑπὸ τῶν ὀρθῶν λόγων ἔσχεν, ἐγγιγνομένην δὲ αὐτὴν καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις ὁρῶν κατενόει, πολλοῖς μὲν οὔ, γιγνομένην δ’ οὖν ἔν τισιν, ὧν καὶ Διονύσιον ἡγήσατο ἕνα γενέσθαι τάχ’ ἂν συλλαμβανόντων θεῶν, γενομένου δ’ αὖ τοῦ τοιούτου τόν τε αὐτοῦ βίον καὶ τὸν τῶν ἄλλων Συρακουσίων ἀμήχανον ἂν μακαριότητι συμβῆναι γενόμενον.	After this event, he came to the belief that this belief, which he himself had acquired through right instruction, would not always be confined to himself and in fact he saw it being implanted in others also— not in many, it is true, but yet implanted in some and of these he thought that Dionysius (with Heaven’s help) might become one, and that, if he did become a man of this mind, both his own life and that of all the rest of the Syracusans would, in consequence, be a life of immeasurable felicity.
ἐγὼ δὲ ᾐσχυνόμην μετ αὐτῶν μένειν.	But I was ashamed to stay with them.
καὶ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ εἰσεφόρησαν ὡς ἐδύναντο πλεῖστα, καὶ ἀναζεύξαντες ἐπορεύοντο.	Then, after putting into his house as large a quantity of supplies as they could, they broke camp and set out upon the march.
ἐμπεπτώκαμεν εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους, τί μᾶλλον, εἶπεν, ἢ εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐκεῖνοι;	We have fallen into our enemies’ hands! Why any more, said he, than they into ours?
γελοῖον γὰρ ἂν εἴη εἰ ἄνευ ἔργων οἰκεῖα ὀνόματα διὰ τῶν στομάτων μόνον φθέγγοιντο.	for it would be absurd for them merely to pronounce with their lips the names of kinship without the deeds.
ἆρ’ οὖν τῷ δοκεῖ συμφέρειν τῇ πόλει τοιοῦτος νόμος ὃς δικαστηρίου γνώσεως αὐτὸς κυριώτερος ἔσται, καὶ τὰς ὑπὸ τῶν ὀμωμοκότων γνώσεις τοῖς ἀνωμότοις προστάξει λύειν;	Can anyone see any public advantage in a law that is to override the decisions of a court of justice, and that requires unsworn persons to cancel the judgements of sworn juries ?
Ἄγκος δὲ Μάρκιος προσλαβὼν τὸ Καίλιον ὄρος καὶ τὸ Ἀβεντῖνον ὄρος καὶ τὸ μεταξὺ τούτων πεδίον, διηρτημένα καὶ ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν προτετειχισμένων, προσέθηκεν ἀναγκαίως·	Ancus Marcius, who added Mount Clius and the Aventine Mount with the intermediate plain, separated as these places were both from each other and from what had been formerly fortified, was compelled to do this of necessity
οἱ δὲ τῶν ὀρῶν ἐπιλαβόμενοι παραχρῆμα μὲν διέφυγον, ὕστερον δὲ πέμψαντες ἱκετηρίαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ κατήχθησαν, ἀδείας καὶ φιλανθρωπίας τυχόντες.	The others gained the mountains, and, for the time, escaped. Afterwards, however, they sent a petition to him, and were restored to their city, and received immunity and humane treatment.
μὰ Δί’, ἔφη, τοῦτο μέντοι ἐγὼ οὐκ οἶδα.	No, indeed, the other replied, I certainly do not know that.
καὶ γὰρ ταῦτα εὐθεώρητα ὁμοίως.	There are a number of other arguments of the same kind, which are equally easy to discern.
καὶ ὁ Κῦρος εἶπε· πρῶτον μὲν νὴ Δία πειρῶμαι μηδέποτε ὑπερπίμπλασθαι·	In the first place, by Zeus, said Cyrus, I try never to eat too much, for that is oppressive
τὸ δ’ αὐτὸ συμβαίνει καὶ πρὸς ἄρχοντας ἐν πόλεσι χρηστοὺς καὶ γείτονας καὶ κηδεστάς·	And the same happens also to most men, with respect to good magistrates in the commonwealth, to their neighbors, and to their kindred
διόπερ ὁ μὲν Ἡσίοδός φησιν ἐν τῇ Ἀσπίδι · θεαὶ δ’ ἐξῆρχον ἀοιδῆς Μοῦσαι Πιερίδες, καὶ ὁ Ἀρχίλοχος ·	On which account Hesiod also says in his Shield of Hercules— The holy goddesses, the Muses nine, Preluded (ἐξῆρχον) with a sacred melody.
ἐγὼ δ’ ἀδικεῖν μὲν οὐδένα τῶν δανειζόντων οἴομαι, μισεῖσθαι μέντοι τινὰς ἂν εἰκότως ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, οἳ τέχνην τὸ πρᾶγμα πεποιημένοι μήτε συγγνώμης μήτ’ ἄλλου μηδενός εἰσιν ἀλλ’ ἢ τοῦ πλείονος. διὰ γὰρ τὸ καὶ δεδανεῖσθαι πολλάκις, μὴ μόνον αὐτὸς τούτῳ δανεῖσαι, οὐδ’ ἐγὼ τούτους ἀγνοῶ, οὐδὲ φιλῶ, οὐ μέντοι γ’ ἀποστερῶ μὰ Δία, οὐδὲ συκοφαντῶ.	I, for my part, do not regard a money-lender as a wrongdoer, although certain of the class may justly be detested by you, seeing that they make a trade of it, and have no thought of pity or of anything else, except gain. Since I have myself often borrowed money, and not merely lent it to the plaintiff, I know these people well and I do not like them, either but, by Zeus, I do not defraud them, nor bring malicious charges against them.
τοῦ σὺ πάτερ, Διόνυσε, φιλοστεφάνοισιν ἀρέσκων ἀνδράσιν, εὐθύμων συμποσίων πρύτανι, χαῖρε.	Hail! then, O Bacchus, president of feasts, Dear to all men who love the wreathed flowers
καὶ σὺ δή μοι Χαιρεφῶν γυναικὶ ̣ κλητεύειν ἐοικὼς ̣ θαψίνῃ, Ἰνοῖ κρεμαμένῃ πρὸς ποδῶν Εὐριπίδου.	as for you, chaerephon, can you be witness to this woman, who looks as pale and tragic as ino when she throws herself from her rock... at the feet of euripides? the baker's wife and chaerephon depart.
ἐθεώρουν ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελος ἀπεστάλη ἐν ἰσχύι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,	I was observing in my sleep and behold, a messenger was sent forth with authority from heaven.
ἐλθέτω αὐτοῖς παγὶς ἣν οὐ γινώσκουσιν, καὶ ἡ θήρα ἣν ἔκρυψαν συλλαβέτω αὐτούς, καὶ ἐν τῇ παγίδι πεσοῦνται ἐν αὐτῇ.	Let the trap of which they do not know come to them; and the snare, which they hid, let it capture them, and in the trap, they will fall with it.
ὅσῳ γὰρ πλείω παρακρουόμενοι πλεονεκτοῦσιν, τοσούτῳ πλειόνων ὀφείλειν ἡγοῦνται δίκην δοῦναι·	For the more gains they make by deception, the greater is the number of offences for which they think they are due to be punished.
οἱ δὲ εἰς ταύτην εἰσελθόντες καὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον εἰς ἀπόστασιν ἔχοντες ἡγεμόνα αὐτῶν λεγόμενόν τινα τῶν Ἡλιοπολιτῶν ἱερέων Ὀσάρσηφον ἐστήσαντο καὶ τούτῳ πειθαρχήσοντες ἐν πᾶσιν ὡρκωμότησαν.	But when these men were gotten into it, and found the place fit for a revolt, they appointed themselves a ruler out of the priests of Hellopolis, whose name was Osarsiph, and they took their oaths that they would be obedient to him in all things.
’ πότερον ἀπὸ τῶν μαγείρων τοὔνομα διαφθαρέν, ὥσπερ ἄλλα πολλά, τῇ συνηθείᾳ κεκράτηκε καὶ γὰρ τὸ κάππα πρὸς τὸ γάμμα συγγένειαν ἔχει παρ’ αὐτοῖς ὀψὲ γὰρ ἐχρήσαντο τῷ γάμμα Καρβιλίου Σπορίου προσεξευρόντος·	Is this word corrupted from mageiroi (cooks) and has it prevailed, as many others have, by force of habit? For c and g have a close relationship in Latin, and it was only after many years that they made use of g, which Spurius Carvilius introduced.
σοῦ δ’ ἂν ἡδέως ἀκούσαιμι τὸ οὐ χαλεπὸν τοῦτο. ἀκούοις ἄν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ.	and I would gladly hear from you this thing that is not hard. Listen, said I.
ἀλλὰ μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς οὐκ ἔγωγε αὐτοὺς διώξω, οὐδ’ ἐρεῖ οὐδεὶς ὡς ἐγὼ ἕως μὲν ἂν παρῇ τις χρῶμαι, ἐπειδὰν δὲ ἀπιέναι βούληται, συλλαβὼν καὶ αὐτοὺς κακῶς ποιῶ καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἀποσυλῶ.	But for my part, I swear by the gods that I shall not pursue them, nor shall anyone say about me that I use a man so long as he is with me and then, when he wants to leave me, seize him and maltreat him and despoil him of his possessions.
σκευῶν μὲν γὰρ βάρος ἀμφὶ τὰ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα ἦν ζεύγει·	for the load of baggage was about twenty-five talents to the yoke
ἀλλὰ καὶ χρυσὸν ἐζήτει καὶ ἄργυρον, εἴ τις εἴη κεκρυμμένος ὑπ’ αὐτῆς, τὰ μὲν ὡς ἀπολῶν τὰ δ’ ὡς ἕξων διὰ παντὸς ἐν τάξει γυναικός.	he asked for gold and silver, if any had been hidden away by her, at one time threatening to kill her, at another promising to keep her for all time in the position of a wife.
καὶ ᾠδὰς ἐκέλευον ᾄδειν καὶ χορείας χορεύειν ἀγεννεῖς καὶ καταγελάστους, ἀπέχεσθαι δὲ τῶν ἐλευθέρων.	They also ordered them to sing songs and dance dances that were low and ridiculous, but to let the nobler kind alone.
ἦν δέ τις Ἀθηνοφάνης Ἀθηναῖος τῶν περὶ ἄλειμμα καὶ λουτρὸν εἰωθότων τὸ σῶμα θεραπεύειν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τὴν διάνοιαν ἐμμελῶς ἀπάγειν ἐπὶ τὸ ῥᾴθυμον.	Now, there was a certain Athenophanes, an Athenian, one of those who were accustomed to minister to the person of the king when he bathed and anointed himself, and to furnish suitable diversion for his thoughts.
οὐ γὰρ ἐνδώσειν αὐτοὺς εἰς ἐσχάτην συγγνώμην ἐφ’ οἷς ἔδρασαν ἐλπίσαντας·	but chiefly because of their consciousness of what they had done, since they would not yield, as not so much as hoping for pardon at the last for those their enormities.
διὸ δὴ καὶ στρατηγοῦντος αὐτοῦ, καὶ πρὸς Καίσαρα μετ’ ὀργῆς εἰπόντος ὡς χρήσεται τῇ ἰδίᾳ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐξουσίᾳ, γελάσας ὁ Καῖσαρ, ὀρθῶς, ἔφη, τὴν ἀρχὴν ἰδίαν νομίζεις·	And so it happened that, during his praetorship, when he angrily told Caesar that he would use his own authority against him, Caesar laughed and said
ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἰσχύσῃ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ τὸ ἱκανὸν εἰς τὸ πρόβατον, οἴσει περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ ἧς ἥμαρτεν, δύο τρυγόνας ἢ δύο νοσσοὺς περιστερῶν Κυρίῳ, ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἕνα εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα.	But if ⌊he is not wealthy enough⌋ for a sheep, he will bring concerning his sin that he committed two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the Lord, one for his sin offering and one for a whole burnt offering.
οἴει τι σπανιώτερον εἶναι ἢ σφόδρα μέγαν ἢ σφόδρα σμικρὸν ἐξευρεῖν ἄνθρωπον ἢ κύνα ἢ ἄλλο ὁτιοῦν; ἢ αὖ ταχὺν ἢ βραδὺν ἢ αἰσχρὸν ἢ καλὸν ἢ λευκὸν ἢ μέλανα;	Do you think there is anything more unusual than to find a very large or a very small man, or dog, or other creature, or again, one that is very quick or slow, very ugly or beautiful, very black or white?
ταῦτα τοίνυν εἴρηται ἐκείνων ἕνεκα.	What has now been said bears on the objects previously stated.
τεταγμένων γε μὴν οὕτω χρή, ὥσπερ καὶ τοῖς φυλάρχοις προαγορεύεται ἡ χώρα ὑπὸ τοῦ ἱππάρχου ἐν ᾗ ἑκάστῳ ἐλατέον, οὕτω καὶ τοῖς δεκαδάρχοις παρηγγέλθαι ὑπὸ τῶν φυλάρχων ὅπῃ πορευτέον ἑκάστῳ.	Let us assume that this formation has been adopted every file-leader must know his position in the line of march by word passed along by the colonel, just as every colonel is informed by the commander of his proper place in the charge.
διὸ καὶ γνώμην εἶχεν ὁ Κάτων, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς συνήθεις ἔλεγεν, οὐ χρηστὰς μὲν ἐλπίδας ἔχειν ὑπὲρ τοῦ πολέμου δι’ ἀπειρίαν καί θρασύτητα τῶν ἡγεμόνων, εἰ δ’ οὖν εὐτυχία τις γένοιτο καί καταλυθείη Καῖσαρ, οὐ μενεῖν ἐν Ῥώμῃ, φεύξεσθαι δὲ τὴν χαλεπότητα καί πικρίαν τοῦ Σκηπίωνος, ἤδη τότε δεινὰς καί ὑπερηφάνους ποιουμένου κατὰ πολλῶν ἀπειλάς.	Therefore Cato made up his mind, and said to his intimate friends, that there were no good hopes for the war owing to the inexperience and rashness of the commanders but that if, then, by any good fortune, Caesar should be overthrown, he himself would not remain in Rome, but would fly from the harshness and cruelty of Scipio, who was even then making extravagant and dreadful threats against many.
ἡ γὰρ εὐπραξία τέλος, ὥστε καὶ πρᾶξίς τις.	for the end is to do well, and therefore is a certain form of action.
ἀλλ’ ὅρα μὴ καὶ τοῦτο διὰ τὴν σελήνην φοροῦσι.	But consider whether they do not wear it for the moon’s sake.
πάντες δ’ οἱ λεχθέντες ποταμοὶ συμβάλλουσιν εἰς ἕνα τὸν Ἰνδόν, ὕστατος δ’ ὁ Ὕπανις·	All the rivers which have been mentioned (the last of which is the Hypanis) unite in one, the Indus.
ὕψωσας τὴν δεξιὰν τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ, εὔφρανας πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ·	You lifted high the right hand of his enemies. You delighted all his enemies.
καὶ θρήνων μὲν αἰτίας ἐπαλλήλους αἱ συμφοραὶ προσέφερον, τὰς δ’ οἰμωγὰς ἐνέκλειεν ἡ κατάπληξις αὐτῶν, φιμούμενοι δὲ τά γε πάθη τῷ φόβῳ μεμυκόσι τοῖς στεναγμοῖς ἐβασανίζοντο.	nor was there ever any occasion for them to leave off their lamentations, because their calamities came perpetually one upon another, although the deep consternation they were in prevented their outward wailing but being constrained by their fear to conceal their inward passions, they were inwardly tormented, without daring to open their lips in groans.
τὸν δὲ τῆς τοῦ Ἰακώβου τελευτῆς τρόπον ἤδη μὲν πρότερον αἱ παρατεθεῖσαι τοῦ Κλήμεντος φωναὶ δεδηλώκασιν, ἀπὸ τοῦ πτερυγίου βεβλῆσθαι ξύλῳ τε τὴν πρὸς θάνατον πεπλῆχθαι αὐτὸν ἱστορηκότος. ἀκριβέστατά γε μὴν τὰ κατ’ αὐτὸν ὁ Ἡγήσιππος, ἐπὶ τῆς πρώτης τῶν ἀποστόλων γενόμενος διαδοχῆς, ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ αὐτοῦ ὑπομνήματι τοῦτον λέγων ἱστορεῖ τὸν τρόπον “ δια“ δὲ τὴν ἐκκλησίαν μετὰ τῶν ἀποστόλων ὁ “ἀδελφὸς τοῦ κυρίου Ἰάκωβος , ὁ ὀνομασθεὶς ὑπὸ “πάντων δίκαιος ἀπὸ τῶν τοῦ κυρίου χρόνων μέχρι “ καὶ ἡμῶν·	The manner of James's death has been Shown by the words of Clement already quoted, narrating that he was thrown from the battlement and beaten to death with a club, but Hegesippus, who belongs to the generation after the Apostles, gives the most aceurate aeeount of him Speaking as follows in his fifth book “ The charge of the Church passed to James the brother of the Lord, together with the Αpostles.
ἐνταῦθα δ’ ἐστὶ τό τε τῶν Μουσῶν ἱερὸν καὶ ἡ Ἵππου κρήνη καὶ τὸ τῶν Λειβηθρίδων νυμφῶν ἄντρον·	There are, the fane of the Muses, the Horse-fountain Hippocrene, and the grottoes of the nymphs, the Leibethrides.
τέταρτος ἀνδριαντοποιός, πέμπτος καὶ ἕκτος ζωγράφοι·	the third a sophist of Stratonicea, a Carian by descent the fourth a sculptor
Οὐέττιος μὲν Σκάτων Σέξστον Ἰούλιον τρεψάμενός τε καὶ δισχιλίους κτείνας ἐπὶ Αἰσερνίαν ἤλασε ῥωμαΐζουσαν·	Vettius Cato defeated Sextus Julius, killed 2000 of his men, and marched against æsernia, which adhered to Rome.
διὰ τί τῶν λεγομένων Φιτιαλέων, Ἑλληνιστὶ δ’ οἷον εἰρηνοποιῶν καὶ σπονδοφόρων, ὁ καλούμενος πάτερ πατρᾶτος ἐνομίζετο μέγιστος;	Why, among those called Fetiales, or, as we should say in Greek, peace-makers or treaty-bringers, was he who was called pater patratus considered the chief?
ξένων πρὸς ἄλλων ἑστίαν πορεύσομαι.	I will seek some other friendly hearth.
οὗτος γὰρ τὰς καπυρωτέρας ᾠδὰς ἀσπάζεται μᾶλλον τῶν ἐσπουδασμένων·	For he prefers lascivious songs to dignified ones
καίτοι κρίσεις μὲν ὀρθὰς πᾶσιν ἐνυπάρχειν ἀνθρώποις νομίζομεν ἡ γὰρ φύσις ἀγωγός ἐστιν ἀφ’ ἑαυτῆς πρὸς τὸ καλόν·	And yet we believe that all men are endowed with the capacity to form right judgements. For Nature of herself is prone to lead men toward the Good.
καὶ θήσω τὰς πόλεις ὑμῶν ἐρήμους, καὶ ἐξερημώσω τὰ ἅγια ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὀσφρανθῶ τῆς ὀσμῆς τῶν θυσιῶν ὑμῶν·	And I will turn your cities into desolate places and devastate your holy things, and I will not smell of the scent of your offerings.
καὶ μέντοι γε τὸν Ἀναξαγόραν αὐτὸν λέγουσιν ἀσχολουμένου Περικλέους ἀμελούμενον κεῖσθαι συγκεκαλυμμένον ἤδη γηραιὸν ἀποκαρτεροῦντα· προσπεσόντος δὲ τῷ Περικλεῖ τοῦ πράγματος ἐκπλαγέντα θεῖν εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ δεῖσθαι πᾶσαν δέησιν, ὀλοφυρόμενον οὐκ ἐκεῖνον, ἀλλ’ ἑαυτόν, εἰ τοιοῦτον ἀπολεῖ τῆς πολιτείας σύμβουλον.	And, besides, they say that Anaxagoras himself, at a time when Pericles was absorbed in business, lay on his couch all neglected, in his old age, starving himself to death, his head already muffled for departure, and that when the matter came to the ears of Pericles, he was struck with dismay, and ran at once to the poor man, and besought him most fervently to live, bewailing not so much that great teacher’s lot as his own, were he now to be bereft of such a counsellor in the conduct of the state.
κατηγορούντων δὲ αὐτοῦ τῶν φυγάδων ὁ Δημήτριος οὐκ ἐπίστευσεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ παρακαλέσαντος αὐτόν, ὅπως ὑπὲρ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἁπάσης καὶ τῶν τριῶν τοπαρχιῶν Σαμαρείας καὶ Ἰόππης καὶ Γαλιλαίας τριακόσια τελῇ τάλαντα, δίδωσιν καὶ περὶ πάντων ἐπιστολάς, αἳ περιεῖχον τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον·	And when the Jewish deserters accused him, Demetrius was so far from giving credit to them, that when he petitioned him that he would demand no more than three hundred talents for the tribute of all Judea, and the three toparchies of Samaria, and Perea, and Galilee, he complied with the proposal, and gave him a letter confirming all those grants
Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὁ δῆμος τῶν λόγων τούτων, εἶπαν Τίνα χάριν ἀποδώσομεν Σίμωνι καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ;	When the people heard these words, they said, “What favor will we return to Simon and his sons?
καὶ νῦν πίστευσον, καὶ ζήσεις εἰς ἅπαντας αἰῶνας.	And now believe, and thou shall live unto all ages.
ἀσπασάμενος οὖν τὴν Κορνηλίαν προαποθρηνοῦσαν αὐτὸν τὸ τέλος, καὶ δύο ἑκατοντάρχας προεμβῆναι κελεύσας καὶ τῶν ἀπελευθέρων ἕνα Φίλιππον καὶ θεράποντα Σκύθην ὄνομα, δεξιουμένων αὐτὸν ἤδη τῶν περὶ τὸν Ἀχιλλᾶν ἐκ τῆς ἁλιάδος, μεταστραφεὶς πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὸν υἱὸν εἶπε Σοφοκλέους ἰαμβεῖα·	Accordingly, after embracing Cornelia, who was bewailing his approaching death, he ordered two centurions to go into the boat before him, besides Philip, one of his freedmen, and a servant named Scythes, and while Achillas was already stretching out his hand to him from the boat, turned towards his wife and son and repeated the verses of Sophocles
Τοῦτο δὲ ὅλον γέγονεν ἵνα πληρωθῇ τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπὸ κυρίου διὰ τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος·	This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:
ἐξένιζε δ’ αὐτοὺς βασιλικῶς, καὶ τὸν τῆς πρεσβείας ἡγούμενον Φαβρίκιον πυνθανόμενος ἐν τῇ πόλει μέγα δύνασθαι καὶ δεινῶς πένεσθαι καθωμίλει, λέγων, εἰ πράξειεν αὐτῷ τὰς διαλύσεις, ὑποστράτηγον καὶ κοινωνὸν τῶν παρόντων ἀγαθῶν ἀπάξειν ἐς Ἤπειρον.	Otherwise he treated them in a kingly way. Perceiving that Fabricius, the chief of the embassy, had great influence in the city, and also that he was a very poor man, he approached him and said that if he would bring about a treaty of peace, he (Pyrrhus) would take him to Epirus, and make him his chief officer and the sharer of all his possessions
Οὐεσπασιανὸς δ' οὕτως οὐχ ὑπέμεινεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀναχθῆναι τὸν βασιλέα, τῆς παλαιᾶς ἀξιῶν φιλίας μᾶλλον αἰδῶ λαβεῖν ἢ διὰ τὴν τοῦ πολέμου πρόφασιν ἀπαραίτητον ὀργὴν διαφυλάττειν.	But Vespasian could not bear to have a king brought to him in that manner, preferring to recall their former friendship than show implacable anger on account of the war.
λαβὼν γὰρ δι’ ἀποδείξεως μέν, ὅτι ὁ διὰ Πηλουσίου παράλληλος τοῦ διὰ Βαβυλῶνος πλείοσιν ἢ δισχιλίοις καὶ πεντακοσίοις σταδίοις νοτιώτερός ἐστι, κατ’ Ἐρατοσθένη δὲ ὡς οἴεται, διότι τοῦ διὰ Βαβυλῶνος ὁ διὰ τῆς Θαψάκου ἀρκτικώτερος τετρακισχιλίοις ὀκτακοσίοις, συμπίπτειν φησὶ πλείους τῶν ὀκτακισχιλίων.	In proof of this he advances that the parallel of Pelusium is south of that of Babylon by more than 2500 stadia, and that according to Eratosthenes (as he supposes) the latitude of Thapsacus is above 4800 stadia north of that of Babylon from which Hipparchus tells us it results that [between Thapsacus and Pelusium] there are more than 8000 stadia.
καὶ ὁ Φίλιππος, ἄφετε αὐτόν, εἶπεν, ἀληθῶς γὰρ εὔνους ὢν καὶ φίλος ἐλάνθανεν.	And Philip said, Let him go free, for it had escaped me that he is a truly loyal friend.
ἰδὼν γὰρ αὐτὸν γνώσεται ὅτι ἔστ᾽ ἐκείνου τοῦ πονηροῦ κόμματος.	he would only need to see you to appraise you at your true value....
Τηλέμαχον δὲ σὺ πέμψον ἐπισταμένως, δύνασαι γάρ,	But you send Telemachus skillfully, for you are able,
καὶ οὐ συνβασταχθήσεται χρυσίῳ Σωφείρ, ἐν ὄνυχι τιμίῳ καὶ σαπφείρῳ·	And it shall not be compared to the gold of Ophir, in costly onyx and sapphire.
ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, Μαίης ἐρικυδέος υἱὲ καὶ Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο, θεῶν ἐριούνιε δαῖμον·	But I will tell you another thing, Son of all-glorious Maia and Zeus who holds the aegis, luck-bringing genius of the gods.
τοιγαροῦν τῷ μείζονι μάντει πρόσεχε, τῷ Πυθίῳ, ὃς ἐξέβαλε τοῦ ναοῦ τὸν οὐ βοηθήσαντα ἀναιρουμένῳ τῷ φίλῳ.	Attend, therefore, to the greater diviner, the Pythian God, who once cast out of the temple him who neglected to save his friend.
δικαίως δ’ ἂν ἐκεῖνός γε μακαρίζοιτο ὃς εὐθὺς μὲν ἐκ παιδὸς ἐρασθεὶς τοῦ εὐκλεὴς γενέσθαι ἔτυχε τούτου μάλιστα τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτόν·	Justly may the man be counted blessed who was in love with glory from early youth and won more of it than any man of his age
μάλιστα δ’ ἠνώχλησαν αὐτὸν Σαλασσοί τε καὶ Ἰάποδες οἱ πέραν Ἄλπεων καὶ Σεγεστανοὶ καὶ Δαλμάται καὶ Δαισιτιᾶται καὶ Παίονες, ὄντες ἑκὰς τοῖς Σαλασσοῖς, οἳ κορυφὰς οἰκοῦσι τῶν Ἄλπεων, ὄρη δύσβατα, καὶ στενὴ δίοδός ἐστιν ἐπ’ αὐτὰ καὶ δυσχερής·	Those who gave him the most trouble were the Salassi, the transalpine Iapydes, the Segestani, the Dalmatians, the Dæsitiatæ, and the Pannonians, far distant from the Salassi, who occupy the higher Alpine mountains, difficult of access, the paths being narrow and hard to climb.
τούτου γὰρ ἡ φύσις κυρία, τοῦ δύνασθαι δὲ καὶ ἰσχύειν ἕτερα. ταύτην τοίνυν παρ’ ἐμοὶ μεμενηκυῖαν εὑρήσεθ’ ἁπλῶς.	That virtue depends on his natural disposition ability and success depend upon other considerations.
ἀπώλοντο δὲ τῶν μὲν Ἀθηναίων νῆες πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἐκτὸς ὀλίγων τῶν πρὸς τὴν γῆν προσενεχθέντων, τῶν δὲ Πελοποννησίων Λακωνικαὶ μὲν ἐννέα, πασῶν οὐσῶν δέκα, τῶν δ’ ἄλλων συμμάχων πλείους ἢ ἑξήκοντα.	The loss on the Athenian side was twenty-five ships, crews and all, with the exception of a few men who were brought to shore, and on the Peloponnesian side nine Laconian ships, out of a total of ten, and more than sixty ships of the allies.
ταῦτά τοι δέομαι ὑμῶν, οὔτε τὸ ὑμέτερον εὐσεβὲς παριεὶς οὔτε ἐμαυτὸν ἀποστερῶν τὸ δίκαιον· ἐν δὲ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ ὅρκῳ καὶ ἡ ἐμὴ σωτηρία ἔνεστι.	That is my request and in making it I am not forgetting your duty as godfearing men or depriving myself of my rights, as my life is bound up with your oath.
Λιβύης τ’ ἐρήμους ἀξένους τ’ ἐπιδρομὰς πέπλευκα πάσας·	I have sailed to Libya’s deserts and all its inhospitable landing-places
τίμα ταῖς μὲν ἀρχαῖς τῶν φίλων τοὺς οἰκειοτάτους, ταῖς δ’ ἀληθείαις αὐταῖς τοὺς εὐνουστάτους.	Honor with office those of your friends who are nearest of kin, but honor in very truth those who are the most loyal.
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἀναίρεσιν οἱ μὲν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἀπέπλευσαν, οἱ δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Κλεαρίδου τὰ περὶ τὴν Ἀμφίπολιν καθίσταντο.	After the dead were taken up, the Athenians went home by sea and Clearidas and those with him stayed to settle the estate of Amphipolis.
τὸ γὰρ πρὸς ἄνδρα θνητὸν καὶ διὰ καιρούς τινας ἰσχύοντα γράφοντας εἰρήνην ἀθάνατον συνθέσθαι τὴν κατὰ τῆς πόλεως αἰσχύνην, καὶ ἀποστερῆσαι μὴ μόνον τῶν ἄλλων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν παρὰ τῆς τύχης εὐεργεσιῶν τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τοσαύτῃ περιουσίᾳ χρήσασθαι πονηρίας ὥστε μὴ μόνον τοὺς ὄντας Ἀθηναίους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ὕστερόν ποτε μέλλοντας ἔσεσθαι πάντας ἠδικηκέναι, πῶς οὐχὶ πάνδεινόν ἐστι;	To turn their treaty of peace with a mortal man, a mere potentate of occasion, into a covenant of immortal ignominy for the commonwealth to strip their city of all she had, even of the largess of her good fortune in the veriest extravagance of malice to heap injuries not only on the Athenians of today but upon all who shall hereafter be Athenians,—is not that an appalling iniquity?
Περὶ δὲ δυνάμιων χυμῶν, αὐτέων τε ἕκαστος ὅ τι δύναται ποιέειν τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐσκέφθαι, καὶ πρότερον εἴρηται, καὶ τὰς ξυγγενείας ὡς ἔχουσι πρὸς ἀλλήλους.	and many others besides, all which you ought to be acquainted with, and their differences so that knowing the causes of each, you may make the more accurate observations. And, as has been formerly stated, one ought to be acquainted with the powers of juices, and what action each of them has upon man, and their alliances towards one another.
ἐρχομένῳ δὲ ἐκ Πλαταίας ἔσοδος ἐς τὰς Θήβας κατὰ πύλας ἐστὶν Ἠλέκτρας, καὶ ταύτῃ Καπανέα τὸν Ἱππόνου βιαιοτέρας ποιούμενον πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος τὰς προσβολὰς βληθῆναι κεραυνῷ λέγουσι.	The entry into Thebes from Plataea is by the Electran gate. At this, so they say, Capaneus, the son of Hipponous, was struck by lightning as he was making a more furious attack upon the fortifications.
οὐδέ γε ὅπως ἄφρων ἔσται ἡ ψυχή, ἐπειδὰν τοῦ ἄφρονος σώματος δίχα γένηται, οὐδὲ τοῦτο πέπεισμαι·	Neither have I been able to convince myself of this—that the soul will want intelligence just when it is separated from this unintelligent body
φέροντες αὐτοῦ σμικρὰ λείψαν’ ἐν βραχεῖ τεύχει θανόντος, ὡς ὁρᾷς, κομίζομεν.	We come bearing his scanty remains in a small urn, as you see.
καὶ ταῦτα τοῦ Μάρδου προλέγοντος οὐδὲν ἧττον ἐκβιαζόμενοι τοὺς ἀνείργοντας ἔπινον.	Of this too the Mardian had warned them, but none the less the soldiers forced aside those who tried to turn them back, and drank.
λίθου μὲν εἴργασται, σχῆμα δὲ περιφερές ἐστιν αὐτῷ, κορυφὴ δὲ οὐκ ἐς ἄγαν ὀξὺ ἀνηγμένη·	It is made of stone its shape is round, rising to a rather blunt apex
πῶς γὰρ φέρεις, ὅς γ᾽ αὐτὸς ὑφ᾽ ἑτέρου φέρει;	how can you carry, for god's sake, when you yourself are carried by another?
ἐγὼ δ’ ἀποδέχομαι μὲν ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους τοὺς καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν ἡμᾶς ὠφελεῖν δυναμένους, οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καλλίστους ἡγοῦμαι καὶ βασιλικωτάτους καὶ μάλιστα πρέποντας ἐμοὶ τοὺς περὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων καὶ τῶν πολιτειῶν παραινοῦντας, καὶ τούτων αὐτῶν ὅσοι διδάσκουσι τούς τε δυναστεύοντας ὡς δεῖ τῷ πλήθει χρῆσθαι, καὶ τοὺς ἰδιώτας ὡς χρὴ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας διακεῖσθαι·	I, myself, welcome all forms of discourse which are capable of benefiting us even in a small degree however, I regard those as the best and most worthy of a king, and most appropriate to me, which give directions on good morals and good government and especially those which teach how men in power should deal with the people, and how the rank and file should be disposed to their rulers.
ἆρ’ ἐπὶ τὰ δεινά, ἡγουμένους δεινὰ εἶναι, ἢ ἐπὶ τὰ μή;	Dreadful things, in the belief that they are dreadful, or towards what is not dreadful?
ὁ δὲ Θεόδοτος, ὢν τὸ γένος Αἰτωλὸς καὶ μεγάλας παρεσχημένος τῇ Πτολεμαίου βασιλείᾳ χρείας, καθάπερ ἐπάνω προεῖπον, ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις οὐχ οἷον χάριτος ἠξιωμένος, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ βίῳ κεκινδυνευκὼς καθ’ οὓς καιροὺς Ἀντίοχος ἐποιεῖτο τὴν ἐπὶ Μόλωνα στρατείαν, τότε κατεγνωκὼς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ διηπιστηκὼς τοῖς περὶ τὴν αὐλήν, καταλαβόμενος διὰ μὲν αὑτοῦ Πτολεμαΐδα, διὰ δὲ Παναιτώλου Τύρον, ἐκάλει τὸν Ἀντίοχον μετὰ σπουδῆς.	This Theodotus was an Aetolian who, as I have already narrated, had rendered important services to Ptolemy's kingdom for which, far from being reckoned deserving of gratitude, he had been in imminent danger of his life, just about the time of the expedition of Antiochus against Molon. Thereupon conceiving a contempt for Ptolemy, and a distrust of his courtiers, he seized upon Ptolemais with his own hands, and upon Tyre by the agency of Panaetolus, and made haste to invite Antiochus.
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔσται τί ἦν εἶναι τοῦ ἑνὸς τὸ δὲ τὸ ἕν, ὥστε καὶ ἐπ’ ἐκείνων ὁ αὐτὸς ἔσται λόγος.	for the essence of "one" and "the one" will both exist so that in that case too the same principle will apply.
παντὶ οὖν ὀνόματι τὸ πρώτως ὑποτεταγμένον ἐναργές ἐστι·	Thus the object primarily denoted by every term is then plain and clear.
ταύτην ἐπαινεῖν πάντοθεν πληθύνομαι, τρανῶς Ἀτρείδην εἰδέναι κυροῦνθ’ ὅπως.	—I am supported on all sides to approve this course—that we get clear assurance how it stands with Atreus’ son.
ξεῖνος Ἀταρνείτης τις ἀνήρετο Πιττακὸν οὕτω τὸν Μυτιληναῖον, παῖδα τὸν Ὑρραδίου·	A stranger of Atarneus thus inquired of Pittacus, the son of Hyrrhadius
ὑβρισταὶ μὲν εὐτυχοῦντες ἀμφότεροι, καὶ πρὸς τρυφὰς ἀνειμένοι καὶ ἀπολαύσεις.	Both were insolent in prosperity, and abandoned themselves to luxury and enjoyment.
καὶ προαγαγὼν ὑπὸ τὸ τεῖχος ἔστησεν ἀτρεμεῖν, ὑπερορώντων αὐτοὺς ἐς πολὺ τῶν πολεμίων ὡς ὀλίγους τε καὶ οὐ τολμῶντας ἐς χεῖρας ἐλθεῖν.	The enemy derided him for a long time on account of the smallness of his force and because he did not dare to fight, but he fell upon them while they were taking their dinner, threw them into confusion, and put their advance guard to flight.
αὐτῶν μὲν εὐψύχως τῆς πόλεως ἐξορμησάντων καὶ γενναίως ἀγωνισαμένων, τοῦ δὲ Νικάνδρου καθυστερήσαντος, εἴτε καταπλαγέντος τὸν κίνδυνον εἴτε καὶ ἀναγκαῖα νομίσαντος τὰ ἐν οἷς διέτριβε πράγμασιν, ἡττήθησαν τῆς ἐπιβολῆς.	They accordingly made the sally with great courage and fought gallantly but either from fear of the danger, or because he conceived that what he was engaged upon at the time could not be neglected, Nicander failed to come up to time, and accordingly the attempt failed. . .
ἐν τούτῳ δ’ ὁ Γύλιππος τῶν ἐν τῷ Πλημμυρίῳ Ἀθηναίων πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν ἐπικαταβάντων καὶ τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ τὴν γνώμην προσεχόντων φθάνει προσπεσὼν ἅμα τῇ ἕῳ αἰφνιδίως τοῖς τείχεσι, καὶ αἱρεῖ τὸ μέγιστον πρῶτον, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐλάσσω δύο, οὐχ ὑπομεινάντων τῶν φυλάκων, ὡς εἶδον τὸ μέγιστον ῥᾳδίως ληφθέν.	In the meantime, Gylippus (the Athenians in Plemmyrium being now come down to the water side, and having their minds busied upon the fight of the galleys) betimes in the morning and on a sudden assaulted the fortifications before they could come back again to defend them, and possessed first the greatest and afterwards the two lesser for they that watched in these, when they saw the greatest so easily taken, durst stay no longer.
ὅτι δὲ ἐκεχώριστο τὰ τῆς ὑπουργίας, πεμμάτων μὲν προνοουσῶν τῶν δημιουργῶν, ὀψαρτυτικῆς δὲ τῶν μαγείρων, Ἀντιφάνης διεσάφησεν ἐν Χρυσίδι οὕτως · τέτταρες δ’ αὐλητρίδες ἔχουσι μισθὸν καὶ μάγειροι δώδεκα καὶ δημιουργοὶ μέλιτος αἰτοῦσαι σκάφας.	But that all these different duties were formerly separated, when the demiurgi, as they called them, attended to the sweetmeats, and the cooks to the regular cookery, Antiphanes shows us plainly enough, in his Chrysis, where he says— Four female flute-players do have their wages, Twelve cooks, and just as many sweetmeat-makers, Asking for plates for honey.
ἐνέθηκε δὲ χερσὶν ἅρπην καρχαρόδοντα· δόλον δ’ ὑπεθήκατο πάντα.	and vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot.
ἀρετὴ δὲ τίς τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἢ κακοῦ κακία, οὐ διείπομεν, νῦν δὲ λεκτέον.	but we did not define what the goodness of the one and the badness of the other was. That we must now do.
καρδία φρονίμου κτᾶται αἴσθησιν, ὦτα δὲ σοφῶν ζητεῖ ἔννοιαν.	The heart of the prudent acquires perception, and the ears of the wise seek insight.
ἄγ’ εἴπ’ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς αὖθις, ἦ σὺ φὴς ἄγειν τόνδ’ ἄνδρ’ Ἀχαιοῖς δεῦρο σύμμαχον λαβών;	Come, tell me from the first once more—do you really say that you brought Ajax here to the Greeks as an ally personally recruited by you?
ἴτ’, ἔφη, ὑμεῖς, ὦ Ἡριππίδα, καὶ διδάσκετε αὐτὸν βουληθῆναι ἅπερ ἡμεῖς.	Herippidas, do you men all go and persuade him to desire the same things that we do.
οὔ τ᾽ ἄρ ὅ γ᾽ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται οὐ δ᾽ ἑκατόμβης,  ἀλλ᾽ ἕνεκ᾽ ἀρητῆρος ὃν ἠτίμησ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνων,  οὐ δ᾽ ἀπέλυσε θύγατρα καὶ οὐκ ἀπεδέξατ᾽ ἄποινα,  τοὔνεκ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἄλγε᾽ ἔδωκεν ἑκηβόλος ἠδ᾽ ἔτι δώσει:	It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault, nor because of a hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured, and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom. For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them.
εἰ δὲ μὴ ῥᾴδιον ἀπαλλάξαι παντάπασι τῆς ψυχῆς τὴν κακίαν, ὅσα γοῦν ἐπανθεῖ μάλιστα καὶ προπίπτει τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων ἀφαιρῶν καὶ κολούων.	and if it is not easy wholly to banish evil from the soul, at any rate remove and repress those faults which are most flourishing and conspicuous.
ὡς δὲ τριῶν ἔτι πλέθρων ἐν μέσῳ ὄντων, ἀντεξέδραμον ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀγησιλάου φάλαγγος ὧν Ἡριππίδας ἐξενάγει καὶ σὺν αὐτοῖς Ἴωνες καὶ Αἰολεῖς καὶ Ἑλλησπόντιοι, καὶ πάντες οὗτοι τῶν συνεκδραμόντων τε ἐγένοντο καὶ εἰς δόρυ ἀφικόμενοι ἔτρεψαν τὸ καθ’ αὑτούς.	When, however, the distance between the armies was still about three plethra, the troops whom Herippidas commanded, and with them the Ionians, Aeolians, and Hellespontines, ran forth in their turn from the phalanx of Agesilaus, and the whole mass joined in the charge and, when they came within spear thrust, put to flight the force in their front.
καὶ πάντα τοίνυν ταῦτα οὕτως ἡδέα μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ὡς μᾶλλον μὲν ἥδεσθαι ποιῶν ἕκαστα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἂν εὐξαίμην, ἧττον δέ· οὕτω μοι δοκεῖ ἔνια αὐτῶν ἡδίω εἶναι τοῦ συμφέροντος.	In a word, all these items appeal to me as being so conducive to enjoyment that I could not pray for greater pleasure in performing any one of them, but could pray rather for less—so much more pleasurable do I regard some of them than is good for one.
τοῖνδ’ ἑλοῦ δυοῖν πότμοιν τὸν ἕτερον·	Choose one of these two destinies
ὅτι οὐκ ἔσον “ταί ταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ. ” τοιαῦται τοῦ ὡς ἀληθῶς φιλοσόφου τε ὁμοῦ καὶ φιλοθέου μάρτυρος αἶ φωναὶ, ἃς πρὸ τῆς τελευταίας ἀποφάσεως ὑπὸ τὴν δεσμωτικὴν ἔθ’ ὑπάρχων τάξιν τοῖς κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ παροικίαν ἀδελφοῖς ἐπεστάλκει, ἄμα μὲν τὰ ἐν οἶς ἦν ἀνατιθέμενος, ἅμα δὲ καὶ παρορμῶν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ ἀπρὶξ ἔχεσθαι καὶ μετ’ αὐτὸν ὅσον οὔπω τελειωθησόμενον τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ θεοσεβείας.	‘ Thou shalt have none other gods but me.᾿ Such are the words of the martyr, true lover both οf wisdom and of God, which he sent to the brethren in his community before the final sentence, when he was still in a state of imprisonment, at one and the same time showing the conditions in which he was living, and also stirring them up to hold fast to the fear of God in Christ, even after his death who was just about to be perfeeted.
καὶ ἡ Κλυταιμνήστρα δὲ περιπαθὴς γενομένη τὴν Κασσάνδραν σὺν αὐτῷ τῷ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἀποκτείνει, ἣν εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ὁ κρείων ἐπηγάγετο, ἐν ἔθει γενόμενος βαρβαρικῶν γάμων.	And Clytæmnestra, being exceedingly indignant at a similar provocation, slays Cassandra with Agamemnon himself, whom the monarch brought with him into Greece, having given in to the fashion of barbarian marriages.
καὶ τῶν μὲν αὐτομάτων ἀγαθῶν οὐ τὸν λαβόντα αἴτιον εἶναι, τῶν δὲ παρὰ γνώμην προσπεσόντων σκυθρωπῶν παραμυθίαν τό γε προσηκόντως βεβουλεῦσθαι.	Any profit arising from chance is not merited by the one who benefits from it, and it is a comfort in the case of an unexpected setback to have taken the best advice one could to prevent it.
ἀλλ’ ὅταν θέλῃ εἶναι Ὑέτιος καὶ Ἐπικάρπιος καὶ πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε, ὁρᾷς ὅτι τούτων τῶν ἔργων καὶ τῶν προσηγοριῶν οὐ δύναται τυχεῖν, ἂν μὴ εἰς τὸ κοινὸν ὠφέλιμος ᾖ.	but when he would be styled the dispenser of rain and plenty, and the father of gods and men, you see that he cannot attain these offices and titles unless he contributes to the common good.
τὸ μὲν δὴ τῷ ὄντι ψεῦδος οὐ μόνον ὑπὸ θεῶν ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων μισεῖται.	Essential falsehood, then, is hated not only by gods but by men.
ἰοῦσι δὲ ἐκ Μεγάρων ἐς Κόρινθον ἄλλοι τέ εἰσι τάφοι καὶ αὐλητοῦ Σαμίου Τηλεφάνους· ποιῆσαι δὲ τὸν τάφον Κλεοπάτραν τὴν Φιλίππου τοῦ Ἀμύντου λέγουσι.	On the road from Megara to Corinth are graves, including that of the Samian flute-player Telephanes, said to have been made by Cleopatra, daughter of Philip, son of Amyntas.
λέγε τὸ ψήφισμα τὸ περὶ τῶν Ὀλυνθίων.	Read the decree concerning the Olynthians.
οὐ μὴν οὐδ’ ὁ οἶνος ἀπελείφθη πιθανῶν ἐπιχειρημάτων·	And as for the wine, probable solutions presently appeared
τί τεκμήριον, εἴ τίς σ’ ἔροιτο, ἢ μαρτύριόν ἐστί σοι τούτου; εἰς τοὺς φράτεράς μ’ εἰσήγαγε, φήσειας ἄν.	If one should ask you what proof you had of this or what evidence, you would say, He introduced me to the clansmen.
περιστάσης δὲ τριστιχεὶ τῆς φάλαγγος Ἰουδαῖοι μὲν ἀχανεῖς ἦσαν πρὸς τὸ ἀδόκητον τῆς ὄψεως, Πιλᾶτος δὲ κατακόψειν εἰπὼν αὐτούς, εἰ μὴ προσδέξαιντο τὰς Καίσαρος εἰκόνας, γυμνοῦν τὰ ξίφη τοῖς στρατιώταις ἔνευσεν.	so the band of soldiers stood round about the Jews in three ranks. The Jews were under the utmost consternation at that unexpected sight. Pilate also said to them that they should be cut in pieces, unless they would admit of Caesar's images, and gave intimation to the soldiers to draw their naked swords.
τί οὖν τὸ κατὰ ταύτην ὀρθῶς γιγνόμενόν ἐστιν;	And what is that which proceeds correctly by its rule?
καὶ πλεῖον ἀγαπᾷ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἰδίαν γυναῖκα μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν πατέρα καὶ τὴν μητέρα.	And a man loves his own wife much more than father or mother.
ἐπειδὰν δ’ ἐμβληθῇ εἰς τὸν φοῦρνον, ὑποπάσσεται τῷ κεράμῳ χόνδρος τις καὶ τότ’ ἐπιτίθεται ὁ ἄρτος καὶ ἕλκει χρῶμα κάλλιστον, ὅμοιον τῷ φουμώσῳ τυρῷ.	But when it is put in the oven, then some groats are spread under on a tile, and then the bread is put on it, and it gets a most beautiful colour, like cheese which has been smoked.
Ἄνεμοι δὲ πνέουσιν ἀπὸ μὲν ἰσημερινῆς ἀνατολῆς ἀπηλιώτης, ἀπὸ δὲ ἰσημερινῆς δύσεως ζέφυρος, ἀπὸ δὲ μεσημβρίας νότος, ἀπὸ δὲ ἄρκτου ἀπαρκτίας· ἀπὸ δὲ τροπῆς θερινῆς καικίας, ἑξῆς δὲ ἀπὸ ἰσημερινῆς ἀνατολῆς ἀπηλιώτης καὶ ἀπὸ χειμερινῆς εὖρος· δυσμικοὶ δὲ ἀπὸ μὲν δύσεως χειμερινῆς λίψ, καὶ ἑξῆς πάλιν ἀπὸ δύσεως ἰσημερινῆς ζέφυρος, ἀπὸ δὲ δύσεως θερινῆς ἀργέστης ἤτοι Ὀλυμπίας ὁ καὶ Ἰᾶπυξ , εἶτα νότος καὶ ἀπαρκτίας ἀντιπνέοντες ἀλλήλοις ·	The winds blow from equinoctial sunrise apeliotes, from equinoctial sunset zephyros from midday notos, from the bear aparctias, from summer solstice (sunrise) kaikias, and next, from equinoctial sunrise apeliotes, and from winter sunrise euros, and in the west, from winter sunset lips, and next again, from equinoctial sunset zephyros from summer sunset argestes or Olympias also called Iapyx, then notos and aparctias blowing opposite each other
Ὁ δὲ Ἕκτωρ ἁψάμενος τῆς τοῦ Πρωτεσιλάου νεὼς ἐπιβαίνειν ἐπειράσατο, οἱ δὲ Δαναοὶ ἀνδρείως ἀντέστησαν.	And Hector, having attempted to board the ship of Protesilaus, was repulsed by the brave Danaans.
μή τοι χλιδῇ δοκεῖτε μηδ’ αὐθαδίᾳ σιγᾶν με·	No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent.
οὔτι μάχας διέπειν Τιτήνων οὐδὲ Γιγάντων οὐδέ τι Κενταύρων, πλάσματα τῶν προτέρων, ἢ στάσιας σφεδανάς, τοῖς οὐδὲν χρηστὸν ἔνεστι, θεῶν δὲ προμηθείην αἰὲν ἔχειν ἀγαθόν.	Not raking up the old Titanic fables, Wars of the Giants, or the Lapithæ, Figments of ancient times, mere pleasing trifles, Full of no solid good but always speaking Things that may lead to right ideas of God.
Ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον ἐκδέξεται παιδίαν, καὶ οἱ ὀρθρίζοντες εὑρήσουσιν εὐδοκίαν·	The one who fears the Lord will receive discipline, and those who seek eagerly will find approval.
ἐπεὶ δ' ἐκ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων ἀπελθὼν κατὰ κώμην Βηρζηθὼ λεγομένην ἐγένετο, πέμψας συλλαμβάνει πολλοὺς τῶν αὐτομολούντων καί τινας τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ πάντας ἀποκτείνας προσέταξεν τοῖς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ πᾶσιν ὑπακούειν Ἀλκίμῳ, καὶ μετὰ στρατιᾶς τινος, ἵν' ἔχῃ τηρεῖν τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ, καταλιπὼν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Δημήτριον ὑπέστρεψεν.	When he left Jerusalem and was in the village called Berzetho, he sent out and caught many of the deserters and some of the people and killed them all, and ordered all who lived in the country to submit to Alcimus. So he left him there, with part of the army, leaving him the means to hold the land and returned to Antioch to king Demetrius.
ὃ δὲ αὐτίκα τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν δεξάμενος, βουλὴν τῶν Ἀλεξανδρέων συναγαγών τὰ μὲν πρῶτα πάντας ἠξίου φιλικὴν δοῦναι Ῥωμαίοις δεξιάν, ὡς δ’ ἀγριαίνοντας ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ συνεῖδεν, “ἀλλ’ οὐ τούτῳ γε,’’ φησίν, “ἀντιλέξειν ποθ’ ὑμᾶς οἴομαι, εἰ τοὺς περιττοὺς καὶ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς οὐδαμῆ χρησίμους, γραΐδας καὶ νήπια καὶ πρεσβύτας, ἐκδοῦναι πυλῶν ἔξω βαδίζειν ὅποι καὶ βούλοιντο, συμβουλεύσαιμι.	The moment Anatolius received the promise, he assembled a council οf the Alexandrians, and at first equested all to extend the right hand οf fellowship to the Romans. But when he pereeived that they were getting angry at the proposal, “At any rate,” said he, “I do not think you would contradict me if I were to counsel that those who were superfluous and in no wise useful to us ourselves, old women and young children and old men, should be permitted to o outside the gates whithersoever they wish.
καθότι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐταπείνουν, τοσούτῳ πλείους ἐγίνοντο, καὶ ἴσχυον σφόδρα σφόδρα· καὶ ἐβδελύσσοντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.	But, just as they humbled them, they became so much more numerous, and they became very exceedingly strong. And so the Egyptians were in dread of the children of Israel.
λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ὅτι Ἠλίας ἤδη ἦλθεν, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτὸν ἀλλ᾽ ἐποίησαν ἐν αὐτῷ ὅσα ἠθέλησαν· οὕτως καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου μέλλει πάσχειν ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν.	And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands."
τὸ γὰρ καλὸν ἐνταῦθα τὴν τιμὴν ἔχει μόνον, ἐκεῖ δὲ τὸ λυσιτελὲς καὶ ἡ χρεία μᾶλλον ἀγαπᾶται τῆς ἀρετῆς.	For in this case it is worth alone which receives honour whereas in the other, personal interests and needs are more regarded than excellence.
Γρηγορεῖτε οὖν, ὅτι οὐκ οἴδατε τὴν ἡμέραν οὐδὲ τὴν ὥραν, ἐν ᾗ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἔρχεται.	"Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
ἀλλ̓ ἐπεὶ ἐν ἰσχύϊ τέθεικεν τὴν σάρκα αὐτοῦ κύριος.	But he means that the Lord placed his flesh in strength.
κἀγὼ Ἰωάννης ὁ ἀκούων καὶ βλέπων ταῦτα· καὶ ὅτε ἤκουσα καὶ ἔβλεψα, ἔπεσα προσκυνῆσαι ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ποδῶν τοῦ ἀγγέλου τοῦ δεικνύοντός μοι ταῦτα.	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw them, I threw myself down to worship at the feet of the angel who was showing them to me.
καὶ ὁ μὲν ᾤχετο. Λύσανδρος δ’, ἐπεὶ ἦν ἡμέρα πέμπτη ἐπιπλέουσι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις, εἶπε τοῖς παρ’ αὐτοῦ ἑπομένοις, ἐπὰν κατίδωσιν αὐτοὺς ἐκβεβηκότας καὶ ἐσκεδασμένους κατὰ τὴν Χερρόνησον, ὅπερ ἐποίουν πολὺ μᾶλλον καθ’ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν, τά τε σιτία πόρρωθεν ὠνούμενοι καὶ καταφρονοῦντες δὴ τοῦ Λυσάνδρου, ὅτι οὐκ ἀντανῆγεν, ἀποπλέοντας τοὔμπαλιν παρ’ αὐτὸν ἆραι ἀσπίδα κατὰ μέσον τὸν πλοῦν.	And now Lysander, on the fifth day the Athenians sailed out against him, told his men, who followed them back, that as soon as they saw that the enemy had disembarked and had scattered up and down the Chersonese, —and the Athenians did this far more freely every day, not only because they bought their provisions at a distance, but also because they presumed to think lightly of Lysander for not putting out to meet them,—they were to sail back to him and to hoist a shield when midway in their course.
ὅταν οὖν ἡμῶν αὐτοὺς προκαλουμένων μὴ δέχωνται μηδὲ καταβαίνωσιν ἀπὸ τῶν ὀρῶν, ἀλλὰ ἀντὶ τῶν χειρῶν πιστεύωσι τοῖς κρημνοῖς, τότε μοι θαρροῦντες ὑμεῖς, ὦ ἄνδρες Ῥωμαῖοι, συναναγκάσατε αὐτοὺς αὖθις, ὥσπερ ἐχθὲς ἠναγκάσατε, αἰσχρὸν ἡγούμενοι δεδιότων ἐλασσοῦσθαι καὶ ὀκνούντων ἀπέχεσθαι καὶ τειχῶν ἄνδρες ὄντες ἀσθενέστεροι γενέσθαι.	Since, therefore, they do not accept our challenge and come down from the mountain, but trust to their rocky fastnesses instead of their arms, be valliant, O my soldiers of Rome, and force them to it again as you forced them yesterday. Let us consider it base to yield to those who are afraid of us, to keep our hands off such sluggards, or, soldiers as we are, to be unequal to the capture of their fortifications.
καὶ ὁ Σκιπίων αἰσθανόμενος ἐπενόει τὸν ἔσπλουν αὐτοῖς τοῦ λιμένος, ἐς δύσιν τε ἀφορῶντα καὶ οὐ πάνυ πόρρω τῆς γῆς ὄντα, ἀποκλεῖσαι.	When Scipio perceived this he planned to close the entrance to the harbor on the west side, not very far from the shore.
ἀλλ’ οἱ νῦν ἄνθρωποι, πρὶν καὶ ταύτας ἐκμαθεῖν τὰς αἱρέσεις καὶ τὰς ἄλλας τὰς βελτίους, κᾄπειτα χρόνῳ πολλῷ κρῖναί τε καὶ βασανίσαι τὸ καθ’ ἕκαστον αὐτῶν ἀληθές τε καὶ ψευδὲς, οἱ μὲν ἰατροὺς ἑαυτοὺς, οἱ δὲ φιλοσόφους ὀνομάζουσι, μηδὲν εἰδότες.	Now people of the present day do not begin by getting a clear comprehension of these sects, as well as of the better ones, thereafter devoting a long time to judging and testing the true and false in each of them despite their ignorance, they style themselves, some "physicians" and others "philosophers."
τοῦτο δ’ ἐστὶ τὸ τέλος τῆς γενέσεως.	the end of the process, of generation.
τάχα μεταστήσουσ’ ὕπνου τόνδ’ ἡσυχάζοντ’, ὄμμα δ’ ἐκτήξουσ’ ἐμὸν δακρύοις, ἀδελφὸν ὅταν ὁρῶ μεμηνότα.	they will soon put an end to my brother’s peaceful sleep, and cause my tears to flow when I see him in frenzy.
εἶναι τοῦ σώματος Ὀσίριδος, ἐν δὲ Μέμφει τρέφεσθαι τὸν Ἆπιν, εἴδωλον ὄντα τῆς ἐκείνου ψυχῆς, ὅπου καὶ τὸ σῶμα κεῖσθαι·	and that the Apis is fed at Memphis, because he is the image of Osiris’s soul, where also they will have it that his body is interred.
ὁ δ’, ἐπεί οἱ ταῦτα εἶχεν ἀσφαλῶς, ἐπὶ τὰς συμμαχίδας πόλεις διέθει καὶ ἠρέθιζε κἀκείνους, ὡς διὰ τούσδε μάλιστα τὴν συμφορὰν αὑτῷ γενομένην·	When he had been confirmed in this way he traversed the allied cities and stirred them up also, because it was on their account chiefly that this misfortune had happened to him.
μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐμβολὴν τῶν ὀβελίσκων πληροῦται θαλάσσης ἡ δῖνα καὶ παραγίνεται ἰχθύων πλῆθος τοσοῦτον καὶ τοιοῦτον ὥστε ἐκπλήττεσθαι τὸ ἀόρατον τοῦ πράγματος, τῷ δὲ μεγέθει τοιούτων ὥστε καὶ εὐλαβηθῆναι.	And after he has put the spits in, then the eddy becomes full of salt water, and there comes up such an enormous quantity of fish of such a description that he is amazed at the sight, and is even, as it were, alarmed at the magnitude of it.
ἔνθεν ἦν Ἀνάνηλος ἀρχιερατικοῦ γένους καὶ πάλαι κατὰ συνήθειαν Ἡρώδῃ σπουδαζόμενος. τοῦτον αὐτὸς μὲν ἐτίμησεν, ὅτε τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβεν, αὐτὸς δὲ κατέλυσεν ἐπὶ τῷ παῦσαι τὰς οἰκείας ταραχὰς παράνομα ποιῶν: οὐ γὰρ ἄλλος γέ τις ἀφῃρέθη τὴν τιμὴν ἅπαξ παραλαβών.	That was where Ananelus came from, a man of high-priestly stock and from of old a close friend of Herod, who when he came to the kingship conferred this honour on him, and now removed it again, to calm the troubles in his family, an unlawful thing since one should not deposed from the honour after taking it up.
πᾶσα μὲν γὰρ ὀνειδιζομένη χάρις ἐπαχθὴς καὶ ἄχαρις καὶ οὐκ ἀνεκτή, ταῖς δὲ τῶν κολάκων οὐχ ὕστερον ἀλλὰ πραττομέναις ἔνεστιν εὐθὺς τὸ ἐπονείδιστον καὶ δυσωποῦν.	For a kindness once upbraided loses its grace, turns a burden, and becomes intolerable. But the flatterer not only reproaches us with his services already past, but at the very instant of their performance
ἐπανελθὼν δ’ ὅμως ἔφη κολάσειν μὲν αὐτῶν οὐδένα, ἄχθεσθαι δ’, ὅτι καὶ τὸ δέκατον τέλος, ὃ προετίμησεν αἰεί, τοιαῦτα θορυβεῖ.	At length he came back and said that he would not punish any of them, but that he was grieved that even the tenth legion, to which he had always given the first place of honor, should join in such a riot.
τὴν δὲ φωνὴν ἐν τοῖς δρόμοις γυμνάζεσθαι καὶ ταῖς πρὸς τὰ σιμὰ προσβάσεσι διαλεγόμενον καὶ λόγους τινὰς ἢ στίχους ἅμα τῷ πνεύματι πυκνουμένῳ προφερόμενον εἶναι δ’ αὐτῷ μέγα κάτοπτρον οἴκοι, καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο τὰς μελέτας ἐξ ἐναντίας ἱστάμενον περαίνειν.	His voice he used to exercise by discoursing while running or going up steep places, and by reciting speeches or verses at a single breath. Moreover, he had in his house a large looking-glass, and in front of this he used to stand and go through his exercises in declamation.
αἰνέσω Κύριον ἐν ζωῇ μου, ψαλῶ τῷ θεῷ μου ἕως ὑπάρχω.	I will praise the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God as long as I exist.
ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ ποιμὴν τὸν πύργον εὐπρεπῆ ὄντα τῇ οἰκοδομῇ λίαν ἱλαρὸς ἦν:	And when the shepherd saw that the tower was beautifully built, lie was very joyful
ἐγὼ δ’ ἡγοῦμαι τοῦτον τὸν λόγον, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, κατὰ πόλλ’ ἀσύμφορον εἶναι τῇ πόλει λέγεσθαι, πρὸς δὲ καὶ οὐδὲ δίκαιον.	But in my opinion, Athenians, this argument is in many ways prejudicial to the State, besides being unjust.
διὸ δεῖ πρὸς ταῦτα ἀντιπράττειν τοὺς κηδομένους τῆς πολιτείας, νομοθετοῦντας μηδὲν εἶναι δημόσιον τῶν καταδικαζομένων καὶ φερόμενον πρὸς τὸ κοινόν, ἀλλ’ ἱερόν·	Hence those who are caring for the safety of the constitution must counteract this by enacting that nothing belonging to persons condemned at law shall be confiscated and liable to be carried to the public treasury, but that their property shall be consecrated to the service of religion
καὶ ταύτας Ἁμαδρυάδας νύμφας καλεῖσθαι καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν πολλὰ τῶν δένδρων προσαγορεύεσθαι.	and that these daughters were all called the Hamadryad Nymphs and that from them many of the trees were named.
Ὁ δὲ τέταρτος υἱὸς Δαυίδου νεανίας εὐειδὴς καὶ μέγας, ἐκ γυναικὸς αὐτῷ Αἰγίσθης γεγονὼς Ἀδωνίας δὲ προσαγορευόμενος, ἐμφερὴς ὢν Ἀψαλώμῳ τήν τε διάνοιαν αὐτὸς ὡς βασιλεύσων ἐπῆρτο καὶ πρὸς τοὺς φίλους ἔλεγεν, ὡς τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτὸν δεῖ παραλαβεῖν: κατεσκεύασε δὲ ἅρματα πολλὰ καὶ ἵππους καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας τοὺς προδρόμους.	David's fourth son was a beautiful, tall young man, born to him by his wife Haggith. He was named Adonijah and in a similar in spirit to Absalom he aspired to be king and telling his friends that he was going to take over the leadership, he provided himself with many chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him.
σῴζονται δ’ αἱ πολιτεῖαι οὐ μόνον διὰ τὸ πόρρω εἶναι τῶν διαφθειρόντων, ἀλλ’ ἐνίοτε καὶ διὰ τὸ ἐγγύς· φοβούμενοι γὰρ διὰ χειρῶν ἔχουσι μᾶλλον τὴν πολιτείαν.	And constitutions are kept secure not only through being at a distance from destroyers but sometimes also through being near them, for when they are afraid the citizens keep a closer hold on the government
ἀναστὰς δὲ Πυθόνικος ἐν τῷ δήμῳ εἶπεν " ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, ὑμεῖς μὲν στρατιὰν ἐκπέμπετε καὶ παρασκευὴν τοσαύτην, καὶ κίνδυνον ἀρεῖσθαι μέλλετε· Ἀλκιβιάδην δὲ τὸν στρατηγὸν ἀποδείξω ὑμῖν τὰ μυστήρια ποιοῦντα ἐν οἰκίᾳ μεθ᾽ ἑτέρων, καὶ ἐὰν ψηφίσησθε ἄδειαν ᾧ ἐγὼ κελεύω, θεράπων ὑμῖν ἑνὸς τῶν ἐνθάδε ἀνδρῶν ἀμύητος ὢν ἐρεῖ τὰ μυστήρια·	" countrymen, you are sending forth this mighty host in all its array upon a perilous enterprise. yet your commander, alcibiades, has been holding celebrations of the mysteries in a private house, and others with him; i will prove it. grant immunity to him whom i indicate, and a non - initiate, a slave belonging to someone here present, shall describe the mysteries to you.
πυθόμενος δὲ μάχην γεγονέναι περὶ Κόρινθον, καὶ Σπαρτιατῶν μὲν παντάπασιν ὀλίγους τεθνάναι, Κορινθίων δὲ καὶ Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συμμάχων αὐτοῖς παμπόλλους, οὐκ ὤφθη περιχαρὴς; οὐδ’ ἐπηρμένος τῇ νίκῃ, ἀλλὰ καὶ πάνυ βαρὺ στενάξας φεῦ τᾶς Ἑλλάδος ἔφη ἣ τοσούτους ὑφ’ αὑτᾶς ἀπολώλεκεν, ὅσοις ἀρκεῖ τὼς βαρβάρως νικᾶν ἅπαντας.	When he learned that a battle had been fought in the vicinity of Corinth, and that only a very few of the Spartans had fallen, but a vast number of the Corinthians and Athenians and the others on their side, he was not observed to be overjoyful or elated at the victory, but with a very deep sigh said, Hech, sirs, for Greece, wha her ane sel’ has killed sae mony men—as mony as micht pit doon a’ the barbarians.
κράτιστον δὲ ἔλεγε τοῦτον ἰατρὸν εἶναι, τὸν μὴ κατασήποντα τοὺς ἀρρωστοῦντας ἀλλὰ τάχιστα θάπτοντα.	And he was used to say, that he was the best physician, who did not let his patients rot above ground, but quickly buried them.
καὶ Συρακούσιοι μετὰ τὰ τυραννικὰ τοὺς ξένους καὶ τοὺς μισθοφόρους πολίτας ποιησάμενοι ἐστασίασαν καὶ εἰς μάχην ἦλθον·	and the Syracusans after the period of the tyrants conferred citizenship on their foreign troops and mercenaries and then faction set in and they came to battle
σημεῖον δέ· ἐκ γὰρ τοῦ Μεσσηνιακοῦ κόλπου καὶ τοῦ συνεχοῦς Ἀσιναίου λεγομένου ἀπὸ τῆς Μεσσηνιακῆς Ἀσίνης αἱ ἑπτὰ ἦσαν πόλεις, ἃς ὑπέσχετο δώσειν ὁ Ἀγαμέμνων τῷ Ἀχιλλεῖ Καρδαμύλην Ἐνόπην τε καὶ Ἱρὴν ποιήεσσαν Φηράς τε ζαθέας ἠδ’ Ἄνθειαν βαθύλειμον καλήν τ’ Αἴπειαν καὶ Πήδασον ἀμπελόεσσαν,οὐκ ἂν τάς γε μὴ προσηκούσας μήτ’ αὐτῷ μήτε τῷ ἀδελφῷ ὑποσχόμενος.	As a proof of this, in the space from the Messenian Gulf and the continuous gulf, (called the Asinan from the Messenian Asine,) were situated the seven cities which Agamemnon promised to Achilles Cardamyle, Enope, the grassy Hira, the divine Pher, Antheia with rich meadows, the beautiful peia, and Pedasus abounding with vines. He certainly would not have promised what did not belong either to himself or to his brother.
τούτων γὰρ ἁπάντων μετεῖχον, Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ καὶ μᾶλλον ὁ πρεσβύτερος:	In all these they were skilled, especially the elder of them, Alexander.
ταύτην μὲν οὖν ἀρχὴν τίθεμεν τῆς τῶν Ἠλείων παραλίας·	This promontory we consider the commencement of the coast of Eleia.
πλὴν οἱ μὲν ἐκ φρονήματος μεγάλου μετὰ γνώμης κατὰ τὸ βέλτιστον ἀπισχυρίσασθαί φασιν αὐτόν, πεῖραν ἐνδόσεως τὸ πρόσταγμα καὶ τὴν συγχώρησιν ἐξομολόγησιν ἀσθενείας ἡγούμενον·	Only, some say that he persisted in his refusal in a lofty spirit and with a clear perception of the best interests of the city, regarding the injunction laid upon it as a test of its submissiveness, and its compliance as a confession of weakness
πεῖσον οὖν σὺ τὸν ὄχλον περὶ Ἰησοῦ μὴ “πλανᾶσθαι. καὶ γὰρ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ πάντες πειθό “μεθά σοι.	cso do you persuade the crowd not to err concerning Jesus, for the whole people and we all obey you.
Δοκοὺς μεγάλας ἐπὶ μῆκος προσεχεῖς ἀλλήλαις κατὰ τὴν τομὴν συνέθεσαν. Δύο δὲ ἦσαν τούτων στίχοι παράλληλοι τοσοῦτον διεστῶτες ὅσον εἶναι πλάτος τείχους, καὶ μέσον ἀμφοῖν τὸν χοῦν ἐνεφόρουν.	They laid great beams of wood lengthways, close together and joined at the ends, in two parallel rows a wall's width apart and filled the space between those rows with earth.
καὶ τρία λαβὼν αὐτὰ ὄντα συνεκεράσατο εἰς μίαν πάντα ἰδέαν, τὴν θατέρου φύσιν δύσμικτον οὖσαν δε ἀνιμαε προξρεατιονε ἰν τιμαεο. εἰς ταὐτὸ συναρμόττων βίᾳ·	Then taking all three, he blended them into one form, forcibly adapting to the Same the nature of the Other, not readily condescending to a mixture.
Ἐρατοσθένης · ὀπταλέα κρέα ἐκ τέφρης ἐπάσαντο τά τ’ ἀγρώσσοντες ἕλοντο.	and Eratosthenes— They roasted their game in the ashes and ate it, (ἐπάσαντο) at least they all did who could get it.
Οἱ δὲ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην κατοικοῦντες ὡς ἐπύθοντο τὴν τῶν Τιβεριέων ἀπιστίαν, σφόδρα παρωξύνθησαν. Ἁρπάσαντες οὖν τὰ ὅπλα παρεκάλουν σφᾶς ἄγειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς· θέλειν γὰρ ἔφασκον ὑπὲρ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ δίκας λαβεῖν παρ᾽ αὐτῶν.	The people of that city, hearing of the treachery of the Tiberians, were highly indignant. So they took up arms and asked me to lead an attack on them, wishing to avenge their general.
ἐὰν μὲν οὖν ἐν τοῖς φύλαξιν ᾖ τὸ κακόν, εὐθέως δῆλός ἐστιν ὁ τὴν ἐφοδείαν ἔχων ἐπιμαρτυράμενος τοὺς σύνεγγυς·	If the fault is with the men on guard, the patrol clears himself by producing the witnesses whom he took with him
πάντα γὰρ ἐξωθεῖται τὰ τοιαῦτα τῷ θερμῷ, χαράσσοντι καὶ ἀναστομοῦντι τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν.	For all such excrements are thrust out by the heat, which opens and makes passages through the skin
τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος “τί γὰρ αὐτὸν ἐβλάπτομεν;	And when Pheroras said, Wherein have we done him any harm?

Μάριος δὲ καὶ Ὄστια εἷλε καὶ διήρπαζε, καὶ Κίννας ἐπιπέμψας Ἀρίμινον κατέλαβε, τοῦ μή τινα στρατιὰν ἐς τὴν πόλιν ἐπελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς ὑπηκόου Γαλατίας.	Marius captured Ostia and plundered it. Cinna sent a force and captured Ariminum in order to prevent an army coming to the city from the subject Gauls.
τὸν μὲν γὰρ τοῦ ἐρίφου πατέρα τὸν ἀσκὸν εἶναι, σχέτλιον δὲ ἰχθὺν τὸν καρκίνον, νυκτὸς δὲ παῖδα τὸν ὕπνον, βουφόνον δὲ καὶ Διονύσου θεράποντα τὸν πέλεκυν.	For the father of a kid he called the bellows, and the sad fish the tongs (which is called καρκῖνος, or the crab). The son of Night is sleep, and the bull-slaying servant of Bacchus is the axe.
τί δὲ ἐπειδὰν ἄλλο μηδὲν πράττῃ μηδὲ κοινωνῇ Μούσης μηδαμῇ; οὐκ εἴ τι καὶ ἐνῆν αὐτοῦ φιλομαθὲς ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ, ἅτε οὔτε μαθήματος γευόμενον οὐδενὸς οὔτε ζητήματος, οὔτε λόγου μετίσχον οὔτε τῆς ἄλλης μουσικῆς, ἀσθενές τε καὶ κωφὸν καὶ τυφλὸν γίγνεται, ἅτε οὐκ ἐγειρόμενον οὐδὲ τρεφόμενον οὐδὲ διακαθαιρομένων τῶν αἰσθήσεων αὐτοῦ;	But what if he does nothing but this and has no contact with the Muse in any way, is not the result that even if there was some principle of the love of knowledge in his soul, since it tastes of no instruction nor of any inquiry and does not participate in any discussion or any other form of culture, it becomes feeble, deaf, and blind, because it is not aroused or fed nor are its perceptions purified and quickened?
ταῦτ’ εἶπεν ὁ Κλέαρχος, εἰ δ’ ἀπιστεῖς, ὦ ἑταῖρε, καὶ τὸ βιβλίον κεκτημένος οὐ φθονήσω σοι·	This is what Clearchus wrote. And if you doubt it, my friend, I, who have got the book, will not mind lending it to you.

ληγούσης δὲ τῆς ὥρας ἐνίοτε καὶ ἡ φιλία λήγει τῷ μὲν γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν ἡδεῖα ἡ ὄψις, τῷ δ’ οὐ γίνεται ἡ θεραπείἀ·	and when the loved one's beauty fades, the friendship sometimes fades too, as the lover no longer finds pleasure in the sight of his beloved, and the loved one no longer receives the attentions of the lover
καὶ Αἰλὼν καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα αὐτῇ, καὶ Γεθερεμμὼν καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα αὐτῇ, πόλεις τέσσαρες.	and Elon and the lands marked off for it, and Gath-rimmon and the lands marked off for it—four cities.
” τοιῷδε φωτὶ πέμπε τίς ξυστήσεται, τίς ἄνδρα κομπάσαντα μὴ τρέσας μενεῖ;	Against such a man make your dispatch—who will meet him in combat, who will stand firm without trembling before his boasts?
’ παρασίτων δ’ εἶναί φησι γένη δύο Ἄλεξις ἐν Κυβερνήτῃ διὰ τούτων ·	And Alexis says that there are two kinds of parasites, in his Pilot, where we find this passage— A.
καὶ ὀφθήσεται ἡ δόξα Κυρίου, καὶ ὄψεται πᾶσα σὰρξ τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ θεοῦ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν.	and the glory of the Lord will be seen, and all flesh will see the salvation of God, for the Lord has spoken.

οὗτοι Νουκερίαν ὑπήκοον ἡμῶν ἐπὶ συνθήκῃ λαβόντες, καὶ ὀμόσαντες σὺν δύο ἱματίοις ἕκαστον ἀπολύσειν, τὴν μὲν βουλὴν αὐτῶν ἐς τὰ βαλανεῖα συνέκλεισαν καὶ ὑποκαίοντες τὰ βαλανεῖα ἀπέπνιξαν, τὸν δὲ δῆμον ἀπιόντα κατηκόντισαν.

Ἀψανοῦς δ' οὕτως ἀποθανόντος οὐδ' ὁ μετ' αὐτὸν παραλαβὼν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν Ἤλων ἐπ' ἔτη δέκα κατασχὼν αὐτὴν φυλῆς ὢν τῆς Ζαβούλης ἔπραξέ τι σπουδῆς ἄξιον.	After Ibzan died, Helon, of the tribe of Zebulon, succeeded him in the leadership and held it for ten years, and likewise did nothing of significance.
ἢ γὰρ τῷ ὑπὸ πολλῶν τῶν τυχόντων ἢ τῷ ὑπὸ τῶν ἀξίων λόγου, καὶ πάλιν τῷ ἐπὶ τίνι ἡ τιμὴ διαφέρει. μεγάλη γὰρ οὐ τῷ πλήθει τῶν τιμώντων οὐδὲ τῷ ποιῷ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ τιμίαν εἶναι·	it differs in being conferred either by many ordinary people or by persons of consideration, and again it differs in what it is conferred for,since its greatness does not depend only on the number or the quality of those who confer it, but also on its being honorable
δεῖ οὖν πολὺ μὲν τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἐπιμελεστέρους γενέσθαι τοὺς νῦν τῶν πρόσθεν, πολὺ δὲ τοὺς ἀρχομένους εὐτακτοτέρους καὶ πειθομένους μᾶλλον τοῖς ἄρχουσι νῦν ἢ πρόσθεν·	Therefore our present commanders must show themselves far more vigilant than their predecessors, and the men in the ranks must be far more orderly and more obedient to their commanders now than they used to be.

When these wrote for Antipater to be sent to Caesar for some time, Herod made no delay in sending him, along with a splendid retinue and a large amount of money and entrusted him with his testament, wherein the kingdom was bequeathed to Antipater, and Herod was named as Antipater's successor, that is, Herod the son of the high priest's daughter, Mariamne.
πῶς γὰρ ἄνευ τούτων ἀρετὴ γένοιτ’ ἄν;	Yes, for how, without these, could it be virtue?

παιδίοις γὰρ ἐοῦσιν ἔτι νηπίοις αἱ μητέρες χαλκίον τετεχνημένον ἐπ’ αὐτῷ τούτῳ διάπυρον ποιέουσαι πρὸς τὸν μαζὸν τιθέασι τὸν δεξιὸν καὶ ἐπικαίεται, ὥστε τὴν αὔξησιν φθείρεσθαι, ἐς δὲ τὸν δεξιὸν ὦμον καὶ βραχίονα πᾶσαν τὴν ἰσχὺν καὶ τὸ πλῆθος ἐκδιδόναι.	for while still of a tender age their mothers heat strongly a copper instrument constructed for this very purpose, and apply it to the right breast, which is burnt up, and its development being arrested, all the strength and fullness are determined to the right shoulder and arm.

"
διὰ τόδε καὶ μελαγχολικοὺς καὶ φυσώδεας τούσδε ἐκίκλησκον οἱ πρόσθεν·	On this account, in former days, these were called melancholics and flatulent persons.
πότερον, ὡς ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἵππῳ τὴν Τροίαν ἡλωκέναι νομίζοντες ἵππον κολάζουσιν, ἅτε δὴ καὶ γεγονότες Τρώων ἀγλαὰ τέκνα μεμιγμένα παισὶ Λατίνων·	Solution. Whether was it (as some say) that, reckoning that Troy was taken by a horse, they punish a horse, as being the Renowned Trojan race commixt with Latin boys?
αὐθαδία γὰρ τῷ φρονοῦντι μὴ καλῶς αὐτὴ καθ᾽ αὑτὴν οὐδενὸς μεῖζον σθένει.	yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish - minded mere self - will of itself avails less than anything at all.

ὁκόσαι δ’ ἂν καὶ τέκωσιν, ἀκρατέα τὰ παιδία τίκτειν καὶ νοσώδεα, ὥστε ἢ αὐτίκα ἀπόλλυσθαι, ἢ ζῶσι λεπτά τε ἐόντα καὶ ἀσθενέα καὶ νοσώδεα.	and if they do bring forth, their children are weak and sickly, so that either they die at once, or live puny, weak and sickly.

ποῦ δ’ ἂν ἠνέσχου ὑπό τινος ἐξεταζόμενος, ὅτι πονηρὰ ἔχεις δόγματα;	How would you have borne that any one should examine whether your principles were bad?
ἐὰν δὲ ἢ τὸ παράπαν μὴ διαθέμενος τελευτήσῃ τις ἢ τῆς τῶν ἐπιτρόπων αἱρέσεως ἐλλιπής, ἐπιτρόπους εἶναι τοὺς ἐγγύτατα γένει πρὸς πατρὸς καὶ μητρὸς κυρίους, δύο μὲν πρὸς πατρός, δύο δὲ πρὸς μητρός, ἕνα δ’ ἐκ τῶν τοῦ τελευτήσαντος φίλων, τούτους δ’ οἱ νομοφύλακες καθιστάντων τῷ δεομένῳ τῶν ὀρφανῶν.	but if a man dies either wholly intestate or having omitted from his will the choice of guardians, then the nearest of kin on both the father’s and the mother’s side, two from each side, together with one of the friends of the deceased, shall act as official guardians, and these the Law-wardens shall appoint in the case of each orphan that requires them.
καὶ κατεργασάμενος τὴν ἀργυρῖτιν, ἣν οἱ ἐμοὶ οἰκέται ἠργάσαντο, καὶ ἔχων τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἐκ ταύτης τῆς ἀργυρίτιδος. πάλιν ταῦτα πῶς ἔνεστ’ ἐμοὶ πεπρᾶχθαι τῷ μὴ παρόντι,καὶ περὶ ὧν Εὐέργου κατεδικάσω;	The Complaint And having reduced the silver-ore which my slaves had dug, and keeping the silver smelted from that ore. Again, how could this have been done by me when I was not here?—things, too, for which you won a judgement against Evergus?
ἢ σύ γε, Μέγιλλε καὶ Κλεινία, ἔχετον διαρθροῦντες ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ φράζειν πρὸς ἐμὲ τί ποτέ φατε εἶναι τοῦτο, καθάπερ ὑπὲρ ἄλλων ἐγὼ πρὸς ὑμᾶς συχνῶν διωριζόμην;	Can you two, Megillus and Clinias, define that object on his behalf, and tell me what you say it is, just as I, on behalf of many others, defined their objects for you?
ἐμοὶ γοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος, δοκεῖ, καὶ εἰ μηδ’ ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ πόλει εἴη τῷ κεκτημένῳ, πάντα τοῦ οἴκου εἶναι ὅσα τις κέκτηται.	Well, I think that even if the property is situated in different cities, everything a man possesses is part of his estate.
γίγνου πρὸς τοὺς πλησιάζοντας ὁμιλητικός, ἀλλὰ μὴ σεμνός·	Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty
καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι ἀπῶσται ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἀπώλετο ἡ ὑπόστασις αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄλλον ἐκ τῶν σκύμνων αὐτῆς, λέοντα ἔταξεν αὐτόν.	And she saw that he was thrust aside from her; her hope was destroyed, and she took another one of her cubs; she appointed him a lion.
Πάλιν οὖν ἡμεῖς μεταβῶμεν ἐφ’ ἑτέραν ἀδολεσχίαν.	Let us pass on, then, again to another piece of nonsense
καὶ συνήγαγεν πάντα τὰ βρώματα τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν ἐν οἷς ἦν ἡ εὐθηνία ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔθηκεν τὰ βρώματα ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν· βρώματα τῶν πεδίων τῆς πόλεως τῶν κύκλῳ αὐτῆς Ὢν ἔθηκεν ἐν αὐτῇ.	And he collected all the provisions of the seven years in which there was abundance in the land of Egypt, and he put the provisions in the cities, provisions from the fields of the city that were around it, from which he put in it.
οὐδὲν δὲ εἰπόντων, καὶ μὴν ἐγώ, ἔφη, τούτου μαθητής εἰμι·	to which they replied that they had not. Well, he continued, I am a pupil of Anaxagoras
τὸ θερμὸν δὴ κατὰ φύσιν εἰς τὴν αὑτοῦ χώραν ἔξω πρὸς τὸ συγγενὲς ὁμολογητέον ἰέναι·	Now we must agree that heat, by Nature’s law, goes out into its own region to its kindred substance
κακοῦ γὰρ οὐκέτ’ ἦν ὑπέρτερος.	for he could no longer master the pain.
” Ταῦτα Μωυσέος εἰπόντος παύεται καὶ τῆς ταραχῆς τὸ πλῆθος καὶ τῆς εἰς Μωυσῆν ὑποψίας, ἐπένευσαν δὲ τοῖς εἰρημένοις·	WHEN Moses had said this, the multitude left off the turbulent behavior they had indulged, and the suspicion they had of Moses, and commended what he had said
ἀλλὰ τῆς ὁλκῆς μὴ παρούσης τὸ μῆκος ὅλον ἴσον ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις συμπτώμασι διαφυλάττεται.	But there being no traction, the whole length remains equal in such cases.
ἡμᾶς δ’ ἡ ὄρεξις ζητεῖν διδάσκει καὶ διώκειν τὸ ἐκλεῖπον τῆς κράσεως.	But as for us men, our appetites prompt us on to the chase and pursuance of whatsoever is wanting to our natural temperament.
Φίλιππος δ’ ἐκ Μακεδονίας ἐκίνει μετὰ τῆς δυνάμεως, ἔχων Μακεδόνων φαλαγγίτας μὲν μυρίους, πελταστὰς δὲ πεντακισχιλίους, ἅμα δὲ τούτοις ἱππεῖς ὀκτακοσίους.	and Philip, finally, was starting from Macedonia with an army consisting of ten thousand heavy-armed soldiers of the phalanx, five thousand light-armed, and eight hundred cavalry.
τί μοι ζῆν δῆτα κέρδιον, φίλοι, κακῶς κλύοντι καὶ κακῶς πεπραγότι;	What profit, then, my friends, for me to live, in fame and fortune ruined.
ἐπεὶ δ’ οὖν εἰσήχθη πρὸς βασιλέα καὶ προσκυνήσας ἔστη σιωπῇ, προστάξαντος τῷ ἑρμηνεῖ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐρωτῆσαι, τίς ἐστι, καὶ τοῦ ἑρμηνέως ἐρωτήσαντος, εἶπεν·	That may or may not be so. But when he was led into the presence of the King and had made him obeisance, and was standing in silence, the King ordered the interpreter to ask him who he was, and, on the interpreter’s asking, he said
οὔτε γὰρ ἔχειν παρ’ αὑτοῖς ἐθάρρουν αὐτὸν διὰ τὸ δεδιέναι τὸν ἀπὸ Ῥωμαίων κίνδυνον, οὔτ’ ἀναπέμπειν εἰς τὴν Ῥώμην ἐδύναντο διὰ τὴν ἀπειρίαν τῶν κατὰ θάλατταν ἔργων, ἅτε μεσόγαιοι τελέως ὑπάρχοντες.	For they neither dared to retain him in their town for fear of Rome, nor had the power of sending him to Rome, because of their ignorance of the sea, being an entirely inland folk.
πῶς οὖν ἀκρόπολις καταλύεται;	How then is an acropolis (a stronghold or fortress, the seat of tyranny) demolished?
Ἰησοῦς δὲ τῆς Χαναναίας στρατεύσας εἰς τὴν ὑπώρειον καὶ μαθὼν οὐ πόρρω τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων τοὺς Γεβεωνίτας κατῳκημένους καὶ τοῦ γένους ὄντας τῶν Χαναναίων, μεταπεμψάμενος αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐν τέλει τῆς ἀπάτης αὐτοῖς ἐνεκάλει.	When Joshua led his army to the region at the foot of the mountains in this part of Canaan, he learned that the Gibeonites lived not far from Jerusalem and that they were of Canaanite stock, so he sent for their officers and rebuked them for their deceitfulness.
συχνὰ μέν μοι προστάττεις, ὅμως δέ, εἴπερ σοι κεχαρισμένον ἔσται, ἐθέλω.	You are imposing a good many tasks upon me however, if it will give you pleasure, I am willing.
Ζῇ Κύριος, λέγουσιν· διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐν ψεύδεσιν ὀμνύουσιν;	“As the Lord lives,” they say. ⌊Therefore⌋, are they not swearing in lies?
ταῦτα δὲ ἐξειργάζετο ἐπὶ τὰς θήρας ἐξάγων καὶ τιμῶν τοὺς κρατίστους ἕκαστα·	And, as a means of accomplishing this, he took them out to hunt and rewarded those who were in each particular most efficient.
οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἄστροις λόγοι καὶ εἴδη καὶ ἀπορροαὶ τοῦ θεοῦ μένουσι, τὰ δὲ τοῖς παθητικοῖς διεσπαρμένα, γῇ καὶ θαλάττῃ καὶ φυτοῖς καὶ ζῴοις, διαλυόμενα καὶ φθειρόμενα καὶ θαπτόμενα, πολλάκις αὖθις ἐκλάμπει καὶ ἀναφαίνεται ταῖς γενέσεσι.	The relations and forms and effluxes of the God abide in the heavens and in the stars but those things that are distributed in susceptible elements, earth and sea and plants and animals, suffer dissolution and destruction and burial, and oftentimes again shine forth and appear again in their generations.
οὐδ’ ἄλλως ἐγγὺς ἦν οὐδέν, ἐπεὶ καὶ αὐτῷ μόλις ἐκ μακροῦ σφόδρα ἐπιμόχθως ἐφέρετο ὀλίγη.	Nor could any be found in the neighborhood, for it was with the greatest difficulty that he could procure a scant supply for himself from a long distance.
ἐπιδεῖν δὲ ἀγαθῶς οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρός ἐστι τὰ τοιαῦτα·	It is not everybody who can apply the bandage properly in such cases
τὴν οἵ γ’ εὐσεβέεσσιν ἀγάλμασιν ἱλάσκοντο γραπτοῖς τε ζῴοισι μύροισί τε δαιδαλεόδμοις σμύρνης τ’ ἀκρήτου θυσίαις λιβάνου τε θυώδους, ξανθῶν τε σπονδὰς μελίτων ῥίπτοντες ἐς οὖδας.	Her they propitiate and duly worship With pious images, with beauteous figures Skilfully carved with fragrant incenses, And holy offerings of unmix'd myrrh, And sweetly smelling frankincense and many. .
ὑπὲρ δὲ ταύτης ἡ Ἄβυδος, ἐν ᾗ τὸ Μεμνόνιον βασίλειον θαυμαστῶς κατεσκευασμένον ὁλόλιθον τῇ αὐτῇ κατασκευῇ ᾗπερ τὸν λαβύρινθον ἔφαμεν, οὐ πολλαπλοῦν δέ·	Above this city is Abydos, where is the palace of Memnon, constructed in a singular manner, entirely of stone, and after the plan of the Labyrinth, which we have described, but not composed of many parts.
ἐς δύναμιν δὲ κἢν οἶνος γλυκὺς, ὁκοῖον αἷμα ἔῃ, ἐς τὴν αὐτοῦ γένναν.	for to impart strength, sweet wine is like blood, which also it forms.
αἱ δὲ οἰκίαι αἱ ἐν ἐπαύλεσιν, αἷς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐταῖς τεῖχος κύκλῳ, πρὸς τὸν ἀγρὸν τῆς γῆς λογισθήτωσαν· λυτρωταὶ διὰ παντὸς ἔσονται, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀφέσει ἐξελεύσονται.	But the houses that are in unwalled villages, for which there is not among them a wall all around, along beside the fields of the country, let them be counted. They will be redeemable at any time, and during the time of remission they will be available.
ὁ δ’ ἐκεῖνον μὲν παρεκάλει ὡς τοῦ Διὸς αὐτὸν ἐξεγείροντος καὶ βοηθοῦντος, οἷς δ’ ἐπίστευε τῶν πολιτῶν ἔφρασεν ὅσον οὔπω τὴν δίκην αἰωρουμένην ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς ἐμπεσεῖσθαι τῷ τυράννῳ.	The seer encouraged him to believe that Zeus was rousing him and aiding him, but, on the other hand, told those citizens in whom he trusted that judgement was hovering over the despot’s head, and was all but ready to fall on him.
σκοπῶμεν δὴ διὰ τί ποτε.	Let us, then, consider the reason for this.
οὑτοσὶ δὲ Χαιρέστρατος τηλικοῦτος ὢν τετριηράρχηκε, κεχορήγηκε δὲ τραγῳδοῖς, γεγυμνασιάρχηκε δὲ λαμπάδι·	Chaerestratus here, young as he is, has been trierarch he has been choregus in the tragic competitions he has been gymnasiarch at the torch-races.
ἔχοντα χρὴ τόξα καὶ ἰοδόκον φαρέτρην στείχειν ποτὶ φῶτα κακόν. πιστὸν γὰρ οὐδὲν γλῶσσα διὰ στόματος λαλεῖ διχόθυμον ἔχουσα κραδίῃ νόημα.	With bow and well-stored quiver We must march against our foe, Words of his tongue can no man trust, For in his heart there is a deceitful thought.
ῥεῦμα γὰρ ἄν τις ὕδατος φερομένου μᾶλλον διανοηθείη σχήματα καὶ τύπους καὶ εἴδη διαφυλάττον, ἢ πνεῦμα φερόμενον ἑν τοῖς ἀτμοῖς καὶ ὑγρότησιν, ἑτέρῳ δ’ ἔξωθεν ἐνδελεχῶς οἷον ἀργῷ καὶ ἀλλοτρίῳ πνεύματι κιρνάμενον.	For one may more easily imagine that a stream of running water can retain figures, impressions, and images, than that a spirit can be carried in vapors and humors, and continually mingled with another idle and strange breath from without.
τί γὰρ εἰ ἠπίστησάν τινες; μὴ ἡ ἀπιστία αὐτῶν τὴν πίστιν τοῦ θεοῦ καταργήσει;	What then? If some did not believe, does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?
καταθεωμένοις γάρ, ἔφη, αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀσθενὴς ἐδόκει εἶναι ἡ φάλαγξ·	For, the man went on, your lines looked weak to those who observed them from the walls.
καὶ γὰρ ἐν ταῖς διαθήκαις καὶ φανερῶς αὐτὸς ἦν ἤδη διάδοχος·	for he was already publicly put into his father's will as his successor.
ἐξ ἀρχῆς δέ με βλάψειν ἑλόμενος καὶ νῦν ἔβλαψας.	You began by injuring me and you continue to do so.
καί μοι λέγε ταῦτα τὰ ψηφίσματα τὰ ἀποπεφευγότα, ὑπὸ τούτου δ’ οὐδὲ γραφέντα.	Please read the decrees which were then by that acquittal validated, and which Aeschines never even arraigned.
καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους δὲ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς τὸν πύργον, τοὺς τὰς ῥάβδους τὰς χλωρὰς ἐπιδεδωκότας καὶ παραφυάδας ἐχούσας, καρπὸν δὲ μὴ ἐχούσας τὰς παραφυάδας, δοὺς αὐτοῖς σφραγῖδας.	and sent them away into the tower. And he sent also the others into the tower who gave up their sticks green and with buds but the buds without fruit and he gave them seals.
καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν ἐκεῖθεν πάντας τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου Κυρίου καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ συνέκοψεν πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ ἃ ἐποίησεν Σαλωμὼν βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ναῷ Κυρίου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου.	And he carried out from that place all the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the house of the king, and he cut up in pieces all the golden vessels that Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the house of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.
ὅθεν οὔτ’ ἀρνουμένους δεῖ πικρῶς ἐξελέγχειν οὔτε κωλύειν ἀπολογουμένους, ἀλλὰ καὶ προφάσεις εὐσχήμονας ἁμωσγέπως συνεκπορίζειν καὶ τῆς χείρονος αἰτίας ἀφισταμένοις αὐτοὺς ἐνδιδόναι μετριωτέραν, ὡς ὁ Ἕκτωρ δαιμόνι’, οὐ μὲν καλὰ χόλον τόνδ’ ἔνθεο θυμῷ πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφόν, ὡς οὐκ ἀπόδρασιν οὐδὲ δειλίαν οὖσαν ἀλλ’ ὀργὴν τὴν ἐκ τῆς μάχης ἀναχώρησιν αὐτοῦ.	And therefore we ought not to deal roughly with him upon his denial of the matter of fact, nor hinder him from making his just vindication but we should rather handsomely help him out in his apology and mollify the matter. As Hector to his brother Paris, Unhappy man, by passion overruled suggesting that he did not quit the field, in his encounter with Menelaus, out of cowardice, but mere anger and indignation.
ἑρμηνεύεται δὲ Ἑλλάδι φωνῇ οἰνοποιός.	which name, as interpreted in Greek, means Winemaker.
εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ καὶ τότε ἀπιστοῦντες ὤκνουν ἑκατέρῳ τὸ πιστὸν νέμειν, καί τινες ὑπόκρισιν ἀμφοῖν τὰ γιγνόμενα διέβαλλον εἶναι, συνθεμένων μὲν ἄρτι ἐν ἱερῷ, μηχανωμένων δὲ ταῦτα ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς.	There were some who still doubted, and hesitated to put faith in either of them. Some accused them both of making false pretences, believing that they had come to an agreement in the temple, and that these were plots devised against their enemies.
οὐκ ἄν, εἴ γε, φάναι, οἷον ἡμέρα μία καὶ ἡ αὐτὴ οὖσα πολλαχοῦ ἅμα ἐστὶ καὶ οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον αὐτὴ αὑτῆς χωρίς ἐστιν, εἰ οὕτω καὶ ἕκαστον τῶν εἰδῶν ἓν ἐν πᾶσιν ἅμα ταὐτὸν εἴη.	No, he replied, for it might be like day, which is one and the same, is in many places at once, and yet is not separated from itself so each idea, though one and the same, might be in all its participants at once.
οὗτος κατὰ τὰς καλουμένας φορκούλας Καυδίνας ἔστι δὲ τόπος στενώτατος ἐνεδρευθεὶς τρεῖς ἀπέβαλε λεγεῶνας καὶ αὐτὸς καιρίως τρωθεὶς ἔπεσε.	He was ambushed at a place called the Caudine Forks (it is a very narrow pass) and lost three legions, and himself fell mortally wounded.
καὶ γὰρ ἐκείνους ἤλαυνεν οὐ τοῖς σώμασι πολεμῶν, ἀλλὰ τοὺς βίους αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς τρόπους δεδιώς, μὴ συναναχρωννύμενοι τοῖς πολίταις τρυφῆς καὶ μαλακίας καὶ πλεονεξίας ἐντέκωσι ζῆλον·	these, indeed, he sought to drive away, not because he was hostile to their persons, but because he feared lest their lives and manners should contaminate the citizens, and breed in them a love of luxury, effeminacy, and greed
οἵτινες ἀπηλγηκότες ἑαυτοὺς παρέδωκαν τῇ ἀσελγείᾳ εἰς ἐργασίαν ἀκαθαρσίας πάσης ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ.¶	Because they are callous, they have given themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
τί δ’ ὅσα φανερὰ γῆς τε καὶ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῶν περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα;	And how about the visible things of earth and heaven and the like?
οὐ γὰρ δὴ λέληθέ γ’ αὐτοὺς οὐδὲν τούτων·	For you may be sure they are not ignorant of these facts
καί σφισιν ἡ Πυθία καθ’ αὑτοὺς μὲν πειρωμένοις ἐς Φιγαλίαν κατελθεῖν οὐχ ὁρᾶν ἔφη κάθοδον, εἰ δὲ λογάδας ἑκατὸν ἐξ Ὀρεσθασίου προσλάβοιεν, τοὺς μὲν ἀποθανεῖσθαι παρὰ τὴν μάχην, Φιγαλεῦσι δὲ ἔσεσθαι δι’ αὐτῶν κάθοδον.	The Pythian priestess said that if they made the attempt by themselves she saw no return for them but if they took with them one hundred picked men from Oresthasium, these would die in the battle, but through them the Phigalians would be restored to their city.
κἂν ἅπαξ ψηφίσησθε, τὸν Δία τὸν Δωδωναῖον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους θεούς, οἳ πολλὰς καὶ καλὰς κἀγαθὰς καὶ ἀληθεῖς ὑμῖν μαντείας ἀνῃρήκασιν, ἡγεμόνας ποιησάμενοι καὶ παρακαλέσαντες, καὶ κατὰ τῶν νικητηρίων ἅπασιν αὐτοῖς εὐξάμενοι, μετὰ τῆς ἀγαθῆς τύχης ἐλευθεροῦτε τοὺς Ἕλληνας.	and once you have passed a decree, adopt as your leaders Zeus of Dodona and the rest of the gods, who have uttered in your interest many splendid, encouraging and true oracles, and summon them to your aid and after you have prayed to all of them for success with a vow of the fruits of victory, with good fortune attending you, proceed to liberate the Greeks.
τὰς γὰρ ὑμῶν οἰκίας ἐρέψομεν πρὸς αἰετόν·	you shall see them homing with you, building their nests in your money - bags and laying coins.
ἄλλον δ’ αἶνον ἔχω ματροπόλει τᾷδε κράτιστον δῶρον τοῦ μεγάλου δαίμονος, εἰπεῖν, χθονὸς αὔχημα μέγιστον, εὔιππον, εὔπωλον, εὐθάλασσον.	And I have more praise for this city our mother, the gift of a great divinity, a glory most great the might of horses, the might of colts, and the might of the sea.
οὐκοῦν τὰ τούτων νόμιμα κατὰ φύσιν καλά, κρειττόνων γε ὄντων;	And so their ordinances are by nature fair, since they are superior who made them?
τῆς δ' ἐργασίας οὕτω συναπτούσης εἰς ἄκρον τὸν λόφον ἀπεργασάμενος αὐτοῦ τὴν κορυφὴν καὶ τὰ κοῖλα τῶν περὶ τὸ τεῖχος ἐμπλήσας ἰσόπεδον τοῖς κατὰ τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν τὴν ἄνω καὶ λεῖον ἐποίησεν.	When this work reached the top of the hill, he joined the whole outer surface into one and filled up the hollow places near the wall and smoothly levelled its upper surface.
ἦν δὲ ἡ μὲν θήλεια ἵππος, καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀποπηδῶντες ἐπὶ τῷ ἐσχάτῳ δρόμῳ συνέθεον ταῖς ἵπποις εἰλημμένοι τῶν χαλινῶν, καθὰ καὶ ἐς ἐμὲ ἔτι οἱ ἀναβάται καλούμενοι· διάφορα δὲ τοῖς ἀναβάταις ἐς τῆς κάλπης τὸν δρόμον τά τε σημεῖά ἐστι καὶ ἄρσενές σφισιν ὄντες οἱ ἵπποι.	The trotting-race was for mares, and in the last part of the course the riders jumped off and ran beside the mares, holding on to the bridle, just as at the present day those do who are called “mounters.” The mounters, however, differ from the riders in the trotting-race by having different badges, and by riding horses instead of mares.
πῶς οὖν οἱ ἀγαθοὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἡμῖν φίλοι ἔσονται τὴν ἀρχήν, οἳ μήτε ἀπόντες ποθεινοὶ ἀλλήλοις ἱκανοὶ γὰρ ἑαυτοῖς καὶ χωρὶς ὄντες μήτε παρόντες χρείαν αὑτῶν ἔχουσιν;	So how can we say that the good will be friends to the good at all, when neither in absence do they long for one another—for they are sufficient for themselves even when apart—nor in presence have they need of one another?
οὐκ ἄρα φωνὴν ἐπίστευεν ἀπόρρητον ᾧ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀπολείπειν ἔμελλεν;	This was not, surely, because he would not entrust a secret to the man to whom he intended to leave his kingdom?
οὐκοῦν ἀνδρεῖοι μὲν πάντες οὗτοί εἰσιν, ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν ἐν ἡδοναῖς, οἱ δ’ ἐν λύπαις, οἱ δ’ ἐν ἐπιθυμίαις, οἱ δ’ ἐν φόβοις τὴν ἀνδρείαν κέκτηνται· οἱ δέ γ’ οἶμαι δειλίαν ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῖς τούτοις.	Then all these are courageous, only some have acquired courage in pleasures, some in pains, some in desires and some in fears, while others, I conceive, have acquired cowardice in these same things.
οὐ γὰρ φύσει ἑκάστῳ πεφυκέναι ὄνομα οὐδὲν οὐδενί, ἀλλὰ νόμῳ καὶ ἔθει τῶν ἐθισάντων τε καὶ καλούντων.	for I think no name belongs to any particular thing by nature, but only by the habit and custom of those who employ it and who established the usage.
μισθοῦσι δὲ τὰ μισθώματα πάντα, καὶ τὰ μέταλλα πωλοῦσι καὶ τὰ τέλη μετὰ τοῦ ταμίου τῶν στρατιωτικῶν καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ τὸ θεωρικὸν ᾑρημένων ἐναντίον τῆς βουλῆς, καὶ κυροῦσιν ὅτῳ ἂν ἡ βουλὴ χειροτονήσῃ, καὶ τὰ πραθέντα μέταλλα, τά τ᾽ ἐργάσιμα τὰ εἰς τρία ἔτη πεπραμένα, καὶ τὰ συγκεχωρημένα τὰ εἰς.	they farm out all public contracts and sell the mines and the taxes, with the co - operation of the treasurer of military funds and those elected to superintend the spectacle fund, in the presence of the council, and ratify the purchase for the person for whom the council votes, and the mines sold and the workings that have been sold for three years and the concessions sold for...
οὕτω γάρ ὑπέρθυρον καὶ ὑπερῷον καλεῖν ἡμᾶς, τὸν δὲ ποιητὴν καὶ κρέ’ ὑπέρτερα τὰ ἔξω τοῦ ἱερείου, ὥσπερ ἔγκατα τὰ ἐντός.	thus we call the lintel of a door ὑπέρθυρον, and the upper part of the house ὑπερῷον and the poet calls the outward parts of the victim the upper-flesh, as he calls the entrails the inner-flesh.
εἰ δὲ ταῖς ἡδοναῖς, μή ποτ’ οὐ λέγουσι τὸ αἴτιον, ἂν ὦσιν αἳ μὲν ἀμιγεῖς αἳ δὲ μικταί.	If on the other hand b they judge by the nature of the pleasures themselves, I am afraid they do not state the right ground for their conclusion, if it be true that there are two kinds of pleasures, unmixed as well as mixed.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν Πορεύου, ἀνάστρεφε εἰς τὴν ὁδόν σου, καὶ ἥξεις εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἐρήμου Δαμασκοῦ· καὶ ἥξεις καὶ χρίσεις τὸν Ἁζαὴλ εἰς βασιλέα τῆς Συρίας·	The Lord said to him, “Go! Return on your way. You will come on the way of the desert of Damascus, and you shall be present, and you shall anoint Hazael as king of Aram.
μᾶλλον γὰρ ἂν ἄξιος οὗτος ἔδοξεν εἶναι τῆς ὑποθέσεως.	for the present discourse would then appear more worthy of its theme.
Γάιος Καῖσαρ αὐτοκράτωρ δικτάτωρ τὸ τέταρτον ὕπατός τε τὸ πέμπτον δικτάτωρ ἀποδεδειγμένος διὰ βίου λόγους ἐποιήσατο περὶ τῶν δικαίων τῶν Ὑρκανοῦ τοῦ Ἀλεξάνδρου ἀρχιερέως Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἐθνάρχου τοιούτους·	"Caius Cqesar, imperator, dictator the fourth time, and consul the fifth time, declared to be perpetual dictator, made this speech concerning the rights and privileges of Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews.
καὶ ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσητε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου ἐργάσασθαι τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος,	But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord to serve the king of Babylon,
Ὠρώπιοι δὲ καὶ ὠφελείας σφίσιν οὐ γενομένης τῆς παρὰ Ἀχαιῶν, ὅμως ὑπὸ Μεναλκίδα τὰ χρήματα ἐξεπράχθησαν·	Though the Oropians had received no help from the Achaeans, nevertheless Menalcidas extorted the money from them.
τὰ δὲ ἐξ ἀρχῆς αὐτῇ Ζυποίτης ἐγένετο οἰκιστής, Θρᾷξ γένος εἰκάζοντί γε ἀπὸ τοῦ ὀνόματος.	before him it was called Astacus, and its first founder was Zypoetes, a Thracian by birth to judge from his name.
μᾶλλον γοῦν ὥρμων ἐπὶ τοὺς Ῥωμαίους ὡς καὶ Ἰώσηπον ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀμυνούμενοι.	they therefore resolved to fall on the Romans the more vehemently, as resolving to be revenged on him in revenging themselves on the Romans.
ἴσχε στόμ’, ὡς μὴ μέγα λέγων μεῖζον πάθῃς.	Hush! lest your presumption add to your sufferings.
δεῖ δὲ τοὺς βουλομένους μὴ μάτην φλυαρεῖν ἀλλὰ προὔργου τι ποιεῖν καὶ τοὺς οἰομένους ἀγαθόν τι κοινὸν εὑρηκέναι τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἐᾶν πανηγυρίζειν, αὐτοὺς δ’ ὧν εἰσηγοῦνται ποιήσασθαί τινα προστάτην τῶν καὶ λέγειν καὶ πράττειν δυναμένων καὶ δόξαν μεγάλην ἐχόντων, εἴπερ μέλλουσί τινες προσέξειν αὐτοῖς τὸν νοῦν.	and, finally, that those who desire, not to chatter empty nonsense, but to further some practical purpose, and those who think they have hit upon some plan for the common good, must leave it to others to harangue at the public festivals, but must themselves win over someone to champion their cause from among men who are capable not only of speech but of action and who occupy a high position in the world—if, that is to say, they are to command any attention.
τούτου τοίνυν πταίσαντος οὐκ εἰς τὸ παρὸν μόνον τοῖς Ἑβραίοις ἐπέδωκε τὰ πράγματα, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς τὸ μέλλον ἀγαθῶν αὐτοῖς αἴτιος ἀποθανὼν ὑπῆρξε·	However, his fall did not only improve the circumstances of the Hebrews for the present, but by his death he was the occasion of further good success to them
καὶ μὴν οὐδ’ ἐκεῖνό γ’ ἔστιν εἰπεῖν, ὅτι νὴ Δί’ εἰκότως ἐφενακίσθητε καὶ παρεκρούσθητε.	Again, it cannot possibly be alleged that it was natural that you should be hoodwinked and misled.
πάνυ δὴ μεγάλην ἐλπίδα εἶχον, ὡς τῇ παρὰ τοῦ Δάμωνος σοφίᾳ αὐτὴν ἀνευρήσεις.	indeed I had very great hopes that the wisdom you derived from Damon would avail you for the discovery.
καὶ προεπέμφθησαν οἱ πολλοὶ σποράδες ἐπὶ τὸν Πολυγνώτου πύργον, ἐκεῖ κελευσθέντες περιμεῖναι.	And most of them were sent on ahead in small bands to the tower of Polygnotus, with orders to wait there.
καὶ Ῥωμαῖοι τοὺς ἐκ Νουκερίας ἐκπεσόντας ἐν Ἀτέλλῃ μετῴκιζον· ἔς τε τὴν Ἀννίβου ἔτι ὑπήκοον ἐσβαλόντες, Αὐλωνίαν τε εἷλον καὶ τὴν Βρεττίων γῆν ἐπέτρεχον, καὶ Τάραντα φρουρουμένην ὑπὸ Καρθάλωνος ἐκ γῆς καὶ θαλάσσης ἐπολιόρκουν.	The Romans settled the exiles of Nuceria in Atella and then, continuing their attacks on Hannibal's allies, they took Aulonia and overran the territory of the Bruttians. They also laid siege by land and sea to Tarentum, which was under the command of Carthalo.
ἐκ δὲ πάντων τῶν προειρημένων τὸ χαραχθὲν εἰς τὸ βασιλικὸν ἡθροίσθη νόμισμα μικρῷ λεῖπον τετρακισχιλίων ταλάντων.	It was from these that the coinage bearing the king's impress was collected and struck, amounting to little less than four thousand talents.
ὁ δὲ τὸν χρυσόμαλλον κριὸν Διὶ θύει φυξίῳ, τὸ δὲ τούτου δέρας Αἰήτῃ δίδωσιν· ἐκεῖνος δὲ αὐτὸ περὶ δρῦν ἐν Ἄρεος ἄλσει καθήλωσεν.	And Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares.
μόνα τὰ βιβλία τοῦ βασιλέως φιλογραμματοῦσι τοῖς υἱέσιν ἐπέτρεψεν ἐξελέσθαι, καὶ διανέμων ἀριστεῖα τῆς μάχης Αἰλίῳ Τουβέρωνι τῷ γαμβρῷ φιάλην ἔδωκε πέντε λιτρῶν ὁλκήν.	It was only the books of the king that he allowed his sons, who were devoted to learning, to choose out for themselves, and when he was distributing rewards for valour in the battle, he gave Aelius Tubero, his son-in-law, a bowl of five pounds weight.
καὶ νῦν δεῦρο ἥκω ἀσπασόμενός τε ὑμᾶς καὶ τὴν προϋπάρχουσαν ἡμῖν συγγένειαν ἀνανεωσόμενος.	And I am now come to salute you, and to renew that affinity which is proper between us."
ἄσμενος δέ τἂν σταθμοῖς ἐν οἰκείοισι κάμψειεν γόνυ.	and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home.
καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἔρχεται ἀναβάτης συνωρίδος. καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν Πέπτωκεν πέπτωκεν Βαβυλών, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀγάλματα αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ χειροποίητα αὐτῆς συνετρίβη εἰς τὴν γῆν.	And look, he himself is coming, a rider of a pair of horses! And ⌊he answered and⌋ said, “Fallen! Fallen is Babylon; and all its statues and its handiworks have been crushed into the earth.”
ἐκ γὰρ ταύτης τῆς ὑπολήψεως ἐξήνθησεν ἡ ἀκροτάτη δόξα τῶν εἰρημένων, ἡ τῶν φασκόντων ἡρακλειτίζειν καὶ οἵαν Κρατύλος εἶχεν, ὃς τὸ τελευταῖον οὐθὲν ᾤετο δεῖν λέγειν ἀλλὰ τὸν δάκτυλον ἐκίνει μόνον, καὶ Ἡρακλείτῳ ἐπετίμα εἰπόντι ὅτι δὶς τῷ αὐτῷ ποταμῷ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐμβῆναι· αὐτὸς γὰρ ᾤετο οὐδ’ ἅπαξ.	For it was from this supposition that there blossomed forth the most extreme view of those which we have mentioned, that of the professed followers of Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus held, who ended by thinking that one need not say anything, and only moved his finger and who criticized Heraclitus for saying that one cannot enter the same river twice, for he himself held that it cannot be done even once.
ἡδέως γὰρ ἂν ἐγὼ ἀκούσαιμι. καὶ γὰρ οὔτε Φλειασίων οὐδεὶς πάνυ τι ἐπιχωριάζει τὰ νῦν Ἀθήναζε, οὔτε τις ξένος ἀφῖκται χρόνου συχνοῦ ἐκεῖθεν ὅστις ἂν ἡμῖν σαφές τι ἀγγεῖλαι οἷός τ’ ἦν περὶ τούτων, πλήν γε δὴ ὅτι φάρμακον πιὼν ἀποθάνοι· τῶν δὲ ἄλλων οὐδὲν εἶχεν φράζειν.	I should like to hear, for nowadays none of the Phliasians go to Athens at all, and no stranger has come from there for a long time, who could tell us anything definite about this matter, except that he drank poison and died, so we could learn no further details.
διόπερ ἀιδίῳ συνέχονται καὶ δυσχερεῖ πολέμῳ·	Therefore, as I say, they are burdened by a perpetual and dangerous war
τῆς δ’ ἀνελπίστου πράξεως γενόμενος αὐτόπτης διὰ λύπης ὑπερβολὴν ἑαυτὸν ἔβαλεν εἰς ποταμὸν Μῆδον, ὃς ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ Εὐφράτης μετωνομάσθη.	The following day, he was pursued by the king for punishment. Overcome by fear, he threw himself into the Xarandas river, which was named the Medos after him.
υἱοὶ Μανασσή· τῷ Μαχείρ, δῆμος ὁ Μαχειρί· καὶ Μαχεὶρ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Γαλαάδ· τῷ Γαλαάδ, δῆμος ὁ Γαλααδεί.	The sons of Manasseh: to Machir, the clan of Machirites, and Machir gave birth to Gilead; to Gilead, the clan of Gileadites.
τῆς δὲ τῶν φαλαγγιτῶν χρείας ἀδυνάτου καθεστώσης ἐκ μεταβολῆς καὶ κατ’ ἄνδρα κινδυνεύειν, οὗτος μὲν ἐπέκειτο κτείνων τοὺς ἐν ποσίν, οὐ δυναμένους αὑτοῖς βοηθεῖν, ἕως οὗ ῥίψαντες τὰ ὅπλα φεύγειν ἠναγκάσθησαν οἱ Μακεδόνες, συνεπιθεμένων αὐτοῖς ἐκ μεταβολῆς καὶ τῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐγκεκλικότων.	The nature of the phalanx is such that the men cannot face round singly and defend themselves this tribune, therefore, charged them and killed all he could get at until, being unable to defend themselves, they were forced to throw down their shields and fly whereupon the Romans in their front, who had begun to yield, faced round again and charged them too.
καὶ προσεκολλήθη Ῥοὺθ τοῖς κορασίοις Βόος συλλέγειν ἕως οὗ συνετέλεσεν τὸν θερισμὸν τῶν κριθῶν καὶ τῶν πυρῶν. καὶ ἐκάθισεν μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς αὐτῆς.	So Ruth closely followed Boaz’s young women to gather grain until the harvest of barley and wheat ended. And she dwelled with her mother-in-law.
καὶ ἐπάρας Λὼτ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἴδεν πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ὅτι πᾶσα ἦν ποτιζομένη πρὸ τοῦ καταστρέψαι τὸν θεὸν Σόδομα καὶ Γόμορρα ὡς ὁ παράδεισος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὡς ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου, ἕως ἐλθεῖν εἰς Ζόγορα.	And when Lot lifted his eyes, he saw all the country round about the Jordan that all was watered (before God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of God and like the land of Egypt until arriving at Zoar.
οὐ σ’, ὦ γεραιά, κατθανεῖν Ἀχιλλέως φάντασμ’ Ἀχαιούς, ἀλλὰ τήνδ’, ᾐτήσατο.	It is not your death, my lady, that Achilles’ ghost has demanded of the Achaeans, but hers.
Ἀριστογείτονος δὲ τοῦ συκοφάντου μετὰ τὴν καταδίκην πέμψαντος καὶ δεηθέντος ἐλθεῖν πρὸς αὐτόν, ὑπακούσας ἐβάδιζεν εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον·	Again, when Aristogeiton the public informer, who was under condemnation, sent and asked him to come to him, he obeyed the summons and set out for the prison
λαγόνα τὴν ἀριστερὰν ἔλυσε· γυμνή δ’ αἰθέρος θεάμασιν ζῶσαν γραφὴν ἔφαινε· χρῶμα δ’·	Another, as she lightly danced, display'd The fair proportions of her lefthand side, Naked-a lovely picture for the air To wanton with
τιθασὸν δὲ χῆνα καὶ περιστεράν, ἐφέστιον οἰκέτιν τὸ Σοφοκλέους, οὐχ ὡς γαλαῖ καὶ αἴλουροι τροφῆς ἕνεκα διὰ λιμόν, ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ ἡδονῇ καὶ ὄψῳ διασπῶντες καὶ κατακόπτοντες ὅσον ἐστὶ τῇ φύσει φονικὸν καὶ θηριῶδες ἔρρωσαν καὶ πρὸς οἶκτον ἀκαμπὲς ἀπειργάσαντο, τοῦ δ’ ἡμέρου τὸ πλεῖστον ἀπήμβλυναν·	The tame goose and the dove upon the hearth, as Sophocles says, were dismembered and carved for food - not that hunger compelled men as it does weasels and cats, but for pleasure and as an appetizer. Thus the brute and the natural lust to kill in man were fortified and rendered inflexible to pity, while gentleness was, for the most part, deadened.
καὶ ἐμπιστεύσας αὐτῷ ἐποίησεν καθὼς εἶπεν, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τὰς δυνάμεις, καὶ ἀπῆλθον εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα.	And trusting him, he did just as he said and sent away the soldiers, and they departed to the land of Judah.
φανερὸν δὴ ὅτι μιᾶς τε καὶ τῆς τοῦ φιλοσόφου καὶ ἡ περὶ τούτων ἐστὶ σκέψις·	It is obvious that the investigation of these axioms too pertains to one science, namely the science of the philosopher
Φιλύλλιος · οὔκ εἰμι τέττιξ οὐδὲ κοχλίας, ὦ γύναι.	With respect to Snails.—Philyllius says— I am not a grasshopper, nor a snail, O woman.
φωραθεῖσα δὲ ὡς ἐπέσχεν ἡμέρα, κατέφυγεν ἱκέτις ἐς τὸν δῆμον.	Detected in the morning, she took refuge as a suppliant with the people.
ἡμῖν δὲ ἐκ πολλῆς φροντίδος καὶ τὰ παρόντα ἐστὶ δαψιλῆ, ὡς αὐτίκα ὑμῖν ἄλλα χαρίσασθαι, καὶ ἕτερα πολλὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἀπὸ τῶν ὄπισθεν ἐθνῶν προσοδεύεται συμφερόμενα.	Thanks to abundant foresight, we have plenty for the present, so that we can give you more shortly, and there are other large sums on the road collected from the nations behind us.
ἔστι δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὸν δεισιδαίμονα εἰπεῖν ὅ τι τὸν ὕπνον οἱ θεοὶ λήθην κακῶν ἔδοσαν ἡμῖν καὶ ἀνάπαυσιν, τί τοῦτο κολαστήριον σαυτῷ ποιεῖς ἐπίμονον καὶ ὀδυνηρόν, τῆς ἀθλίας ψυχῆς εἰς ἄλλον ὕπνον ἀποδρᾶναι μὴ δυναμένης;	It might as well be said to the superstitious bigot Since the Gods have bestowed sleep on us, to the intent we may take some rest and forget our sorrows, why will you needs make it a continual irksome tormentor, when you know your poor soul hath ne’er another sleep to betake herself to?
σχῆμα μὲν βωμοῦ περιφεροῦς ἐστι, παραθέοντας δὲ κατὰ τοῦτο τοὺς ἵππους φόβος τε αὐτίκα ἰσχυρὸς ἀπ’ οὐδεμιᾶς προφάσεως φανερᾶς καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου λαμβάνει ταραχή, τά τε δὴ ἅρματα καταγνύουσιν ὡς ἐπίπαν καὶ οἱ ἡνίοχοι τιτρώσκονται·	It has the shape of a round altar, and as they run along the horses are seized, as soon as they reach this point, by a great fear without any apparent reason. The fear leads to disorder the chariots generally crash and the charioteers are injured.
λυπούμενος δὲ Θησεὺς ἐπ’ Ἀριάδνῃ καταπλέων ἐπελάθετο πετάσαι τὴν ναῦν λευκοῖς ἱστίοις. Αἰγεὺς δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως τὴν ναῦν ἰδὼν ἔχουσαν μέλαν ἱστίον, Θησέα νομίσας ἀπολλέναι ῥίψας ἑαυτὸν μετήλλαξε.	In his grief on account of Ariadne, Theseus forgot to spread white sails on his ship when he stood for port and Aegeus, seeing from the acropolis the ship with a black sail, supposed that Theseus had perished so he cast himself down and died.
καὶ οὐκ ἐταπεινώθη ἐναντίον Κυρίου ὡς ἐταπεινώθη Μανασσὴ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι υἱὸς Ἀμὼς ἐπλήθυνεν πλημμέλειαν.	He was not humbled before the Lord as his father, Manasseh, was humbled, because his son, Amon, increased offenses.
Θηβαίοις δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Ἄμμωνος τὸ ἱερὸν οἰωνοσκοπεῖόν τε Τειρεσίου καλούμενον καὶ πλησίον Τύχης ἐστὶν ἱερόν· φέρει μὲν δὴ Πλοῦτον παῖδα·	After the sanctuary of Ammon at Thebes comes what is called the bird-observatory of Teiresias, and near it is a sanctuary of Fortune, who carries the child Wealth.
Πλὴν τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην· καὶ ἰδού, πάντα καθαρὰ ὑμῖν ἐστιν.	"But rather give alms of such things as you have; then indeed all things are clean to you.
ἐπ᾽ ἐνίων δέ, ἂν πεφυκότα ἔχειν μὴ ἔχῃ βίᾳ, ἐστερῆσθαι ταῦτα λέγομεν.	but similarly they cannot explain the definition either.
οἱ δὲ Ἀλεξανδρεῖς ὥρμησαν μὲν ὡς ἀποκτενοῦντες τὸν Πτολεμαῖον, ὡς δὲ σφᾶς ἔφθασεν ἐπιβὰς νεώς, Ἀλέξανδρον ἥκοντα ἐκ Κύπρου ποιοῦνται βασιλέα.	The people of Alexandria rushed to kill Ptolemy, and when he escaped on board a ship, made Alexander, who returned from Cyprus, their king.
ἔτι δ’ ἐπὶ τοῦ βωμοῦ τὴν θυσίαν ἔχοντος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ μήπω πᾶσαν διὰ τῆς ἱερᾶς φλογὸς ἀπειληφότος προῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ στρατοπέδου ἡ τῶν πολεμίων δύναμις καὶ παρατάσσεται εἰς μάχην, ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι μὲν νίκης, ὡς ἀπειλημμένων ἐν ἀπορίᾳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων μήτε ὅπλα ἐχόντων μήτε ὡς ἐπὶ μάχῃ ἐκεῖσε ἀπηντηκότων, περιπίπτουσι δὲ οἷς οὐδ’ εἰ προύλεγέ τις ῥᾳδίως ἐπείσθησαν.	Now while the altar had the sacrifice of God upon it, and had not yet consumed it wholly by its sacred fire, the enemy's army marched out of their camp, and was put in order of battle, and this in hope that they should be conquerors, since the Jews were caught in distressed circumstances, as neither having their weapons with them, nor being assembled there in order to fight. But things so fell out, that they would hardly have been credited though they had been foretold by anybody
Ἕρνικοι δὲ πλησίον ᾤκουν τῷ τε Λανουίῳ καὶ τῇ Ἄλβᾳ καὶ αὐτῇ τῇ Ῥώμῃ·	The Hernici dwelt near to Lanuvium, Alba, and to Rome itself
καὶ χαίρειν ἐάσας τὸν ἰατρὸν ἔλαβέ τι τῶν εὐπορίστων.	and paying no regard to the physician he took something that could easily be procured.
καὶ Κορίνθιοι ἐπολέμησαν ἰδίων τινῶν διαφορῶν ἕνεκα τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις·	The Corinthians also commenced hostilities with the Athenians for private quarrels of their own
πότερα δὲ τοῦτ’ ἐποίει τὸν Ἀντίοχον ὑποπτεύων μή ποτε κρατήσας τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας βαρὺς ἔφεδρος αὐτοῖς γένηται, τοῦ πρὸς τὸν Περσέα πολέμου χρόνον λαμβάνοντος· ἤδη γὰρ τότε συνέβαινε συγκεχύσθαι τὸν περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας πόλεμον·	Did the Consul act thus because he was suspicious of Antiochus, and was afraid, if he conquered Alexandria, that he would prove a formidable second enemy to themselves, seeing that the war with Perseus was becoming protracted, and the war for Coele-Syria had already broken out?
κἂν ταύτην ἔχοντες τὴν διάνοιαν ἀκούητε τῶν μελλόντων ῥηθήσεσθαι λόγων, εὖ οἶδ’ καὶ δίκαια καὶ εὔορκα καὶ συμφέροντα ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς ψηφιεῖσθε καὶ πάσῃ τῇ πόλει.	If in this spirit you listen to the words which are about to be spoken, I am sure that your verdict will be just, faithful to your oath, and salutary alike to yourselves and to the commonwealth.
ἐμπείρους γὰρ εἶναι τῶν περὶ θεοὺς νομίμων· εἶναί τε τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἐπιστήμην θεῶν θεραπείας.	for they have acquaintance with the rites of the gods, and piety is the knowledge of how to serve the gods.
φόνων γὰρ ἀντικαταλλασσόμενοι φόνους ὁμοίως μὲν οἷς ἐλάμβανον ἀνῄρουν οὓς ἐδίδοσαν, ἀδικώτεροι δὲ περὶ τοὺς φίλους ἦσαν, οὓς ἀπεκτίννυσαν μηδὲ μισοῦντες.	For by this barter of murder for murder they put to death those whom they surrendered just as truly as those whom they seized but their injustice was greater towards their friends, whom they slew without so much as hating them.
Κύπρῳ δ’ ἐξ Ἀντιπάτρου θυγάτηρ γίνεται Κύπρος, καὶ αὐτὴν Ἀλεξᾶς ὁ Ἐλκίας γαμεῖ τοῦ Ἀλεξᾶ, καὶ αὐτῆς θυγάτηρ ἦν Κύπρος.	But the daughter of Antipater by Cypros was Cypros, whom Alexas Selcias, the son of Alexas, married they had a daughter, Cypros
σκιρτημάτων δὲ νήστισιν αἰκίαις λαβρόσυτος ἦλθον, Ἥρασ ἐπικότοισι μήδεσι δαμεῖσα.	In frenzied bounds I come, driven by torturing hunger, victim of Hera’s vengeful purpose.
ἐὰν κωλύσῃ τὸ ὕδωρ, ξηρανεῖ τὴν γῆν· ἐὰν δὲ ἐπαφῇ, ἀπώλεσεν αὐτὴν καταστρέψας.	If he should withhold the water, he will dry up the earth, and if he should let it loose, he destroys it by turning it over.
οὐδὲ γὰρ παρ’ Ἕλλησιν οἱ πρῶτοι λίθινον καὶ χαλκοῦν στήσαντες τρόπαιον εὐδοκιμοῦσιν.	Nor among the Greeks, either, do they that first erected a trophy of stone or of bronze stand in good repute.
ὡς δὲ ἀφίκοντο ἐπὶ τὸν Σπερχειόν, οἱ ἐντεῦθεν ὑποκαθήμενοι Θεσσαλοὶ καὶ οἱ Μαλιεῖς ἐνεφορήθησαν οὕτω σφῶν ὡς μηδένα οἴκαδε ἀποσωθῆναι.	But after their arrival at the Spercheius, during the rest of the retreat the Thessalians and Malians kept lying in wait for them, and so took their fill of slaughter that not a Gaul returned home in safety.
οὐ γὰρ κρατήσειν τῶν πραγμάτων, εἰ πρὸς Ἀρχελάῳ πάππῳ καὶ Φερώραν κηδεστὴν ὁ Ἀλεξάνδρου παῖς προσλάβοι.	He said he would never be able to stay in power, if Alexander's son was to have his grandfather Archelaus and Pheroras as his guardians.
ἦν δὲ τοιοῦτος μὲν Αἰγυπτίοις, Ἑβραίοις δὲ γλυκὺς καὶ πότιμος καὶ μηδὲν τοῦ κατὰ φύσιν παρηλλαγμένος. πρὸς οὖν τὸ παράδοξον ἀμηχανήσας ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ δείσας περὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων συνεχώρει τοῖς Ἑβραίοις ἀπιέναι: καὶ τοῦ κακοῦ λωφήσαντος πάλιν τὴν γνώμην μετέβαλεν οὐκ ἐπιτρέπων τὴν ἄφοδον αὐτοῖς.	It was like that to the Egyptians, but to the Hebrews it was sweet and fit to drink and no way different to normal. As in these paradoxical circumstances the king did not know what to do and was afraid on behalf of the Egyptians, he allowed the Hebrews to leave, but when the plague ceased, he changed his mind again, end would not let them go.
Ἰσραὴλ δέ, διώκων νόμον δικαιοσύνης, εἰς νόμον δικαιοσύνης οὐκ ἔφθασεν.	but Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.
τὸ δὲ στόμα τοῦ Περσικοῦ κόλπου μεῖζον διάρματος ἡμερησίου.	The passage across the mouth of the Persian Gulf does not occupy more than one day.
ἀλλὰ πέραινε μόνον μήτε δεδραμένα μήτ᾽ εἰρημένα πω πρότερον·	but do not fail to put your plans into execution immediately

ἀτὰρ ἢν Κέφαλός σοι λοιδορῆται προσφθαρείς, πῶς ἀντερεῖς πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τἠκκλησίᾳ;	but if cephalus belches forth insults against you, what answer will you give him in the assembly?
ἦν γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν χρόνοις τῆς ἀμιξίας κρίσεις εἰσενηνεγμένος Ἰουδαισμοῦ, καὶ σῶμα καὶ ψυχὴν ὑπὲρ τοῦ Ἰουδαισμοῦ παραβεβλημένος μετὰ πάσης ἐκτενίας.	For in those earlier times of purity he was hauled to trials for Judaism and risked with all zeal body and soul on behalf of Judaism.
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς Ἵνα τί ἐζωγρήσατε πᾶν θῆλυ;	And Moses said to them, “For what reason did you capture every female alive?
οὐκ αἰδεῖσθε τοὺς ἡμέρους καρποὺς αἵματι καὶ φόνῳ μιγνύοντες;	Are you not ashamed to mingle domestic crops with blood and gore?
ἐγὼ δὲ ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοὺς ἡμίσεις μὲν τῶν πεζῶν ἔχων, πάντας δὲ τοὺς ἱππέας, πορεύσομαι διὰ τοῦ πεδίου εὐθὺς πρὸς τὰ βασίλεια.	but I, at break of day, with half the infantry and all the cavalry, will proceed through the plain straight toward the capital.
αὕτη δὲ εὐρυτέρα τέ ἐστι καὶ ἡ κάθοδος εἶχεν αὕτη βασμίδας ποτὲ ἐμπεποιημένας·	The latter is the broader, and its descent had steps that were once cut into it.
παραβολὴ δὲ τὰ Σωκρατικά, οἷον εἴ τις λέγοι ὅτι οὐ δεῖ κληρωτοὺς ἄρχειν·	Comparison is illustrated by the sayings of Socrates
οὔτε φοβούμενον στῆναι πείσειας, οὔτε δυσφοροῦντα μετανοίᾳ μὴ βοῆσαι μηδὲ τῶν τριχῶν λαβέσθαι ἢ τὸν μηρὸν κροῦσαι.	nor can you persuade one that is in a fright to stand still, or one that is stung with remorse of conscience to forbear exclaiming, tearing his hair, and smiting his thigh.
ἀπάρας δὲ ἐκεῖθεν ὤρυξεν φρέαρ ἕτερον, καὶ οὐκ ἐμαχέσαντο περὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Εὐρυχωρία, λέγων Διότι νῦν ἐπλάτυνεν Κύριος ἡμῖν καὶ ηὔξησεν ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.	Separating from there, he dug up another well, and they did not fight about it, and he named its name “Open Space,” saying, “Since now the Lord has made room for us and increased us upon the land.”
σὺ δὴ Γλαῦκον χθές, ὦ Ζεύξιππε, τὸν ἰατρὸν ἀπετρίψω συμφιλοσοφεῖν ὑμῖν βουλόμενον.	And you, Zeuxippus, diverted Glaucus the physician from entering into a philosophical discourse with you yesterday.
καὶ ἄλλα δ’ ἐστὶ μέταλλα, καὶ δὴ τῆς σάνδικος καλουμένης, ἣν δὴ καὶ Ἀρμένιον καλοῦσι χρῶμα, ὅμοιον κάλχῃ.	There are other mines, and also a mine of Sandyx as it is called, to which is given the name of Armenian colour, it resembles the Calche.
φύσει δὲ οὐδὲ περὶ ἐμὲ νομίζω πονηροὺς γεγονέναι, θεοῦ δὲ βουλήσει τήν τε νῦν πραγματευομένου τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀπόλαυσιν καὶ τὴν ἐς ὕστερον, ἂν εὐμενὴς ἡμῖν παραμείνῃ.	so I believe you were not wicked by nature in what you did in my case, but that all has happened according to God's will, who has hereby procured our enjoyment of what good things we have and, if he continue in a favorable disposition, of what we hope for hereafter.
καὶ γὰρ ἐκείνων μετριαζόντων αἰσχρὸν ὁμοίως τὸ δουλεύειν.	for if they treated you with moderation, it would still be equally an unworthy thing to be in servitude.
καὶ τάδε, ὅτι, ἢν μὲν ἰσχυρῶς τὸν βραχίονα ἀνατείνῃς, οὐ δυνήσῃ τοῦ δέρματος ἀπολαβεῖν οὐδὲν τοῦ ὑπὸ τῇ μασχάλῃ, ὅ τι καὶ ἄξιον λόγου· καταναισιμοῦται γὰρ ἐν τῇ ἀνατάσει·	And this, also, it is proper to know, that if you raise the arm much, you will not be able to grasp any quantity of skin worth mentioning, for it is all taken up with the stretching
’ ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοιαῦτα εἶπε, τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων παριόντες οἱ μὲν πλεῖστοι στρατεύειν παρῄνουν καὶ τὰ ἐψηφισμένα μὴ λύειν, οἱ δέ τινες καὶ ἀντέλεγον.	Thus spake Nicias. But the most of the Athenians that spake after him were of opinion that the voyage ought to proceed, the decree already made not to be reversed yet some there were that said to the contrary.
ἡ δ’ ἐκ τῆς Ἰβηρίας εἰς τὴν Ἀλβανίαν εἰσβολὴ διὰ τῆς Καμβυσηνῆς ἀνύδρου τε καὶ τραχείας ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀλαζόνιον ποταμόν.	The entrance from Iberia into Albania is through the Cambysene, a country without water, and rocky, to the river Alazonius.
περὶ δὲ τῶν Νικολάων καλουμένων φοινίκων τοσοῦτον ὑμῖν εἰπεῖν ἔχω τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς Συρίας καταγομένων, ὅτι ταύτης τῆς προσηγορίας ἠξιώθησαν ὑπὸ τοῦ Σεβαστοῦ αὐτοκράτορος σφόδρα χαίροντος τῷ βρώματι, Νικολάου τοῦ Δαμασκηνοῦ ἑταίρου ὄντος αὐτῷ καὶ πέμποντος φοίνικας συνεχῶς.	But concerning those that are called the Nicolaan dates, which are imported from Syria, I can give you this information that they received this name from Augustus the emperor, because he was exceedingly fond of the fruit, and because Nicolaus of Damascus, who was his friend, was constantly sending him presents of it.
ἀτὰρ ἥτις εἶ γε, πόλλ᾽ ἀγαθὰ γένοιτό σοι, ὅτι μ᾽ οὐπεριεῖδες ἐπιτριβέντ᾽. ὦ Ἡράκλεις ὦ Πᾶνες ὦ Κορύβαντες ὦ Διοσκόρω, τοῦτ᾽ αὖ πολὺ τούτου τὸ κακὸν ἐξωλέστερον. ἀτὰρ τί τὸ πρᾶγμ᾽ ἔστ᾽ ἀντιβολῶ τουτί ποτε;	oh! whoever you are, may heaven bless you for having had pity on me in my dire misfortune. turns round and sees the third old woman. oh heracles! oh pan! oh corybantes! oh dioscuri! why, she is still more awful! oh! what a monster! great gods!
οἱ μὲν οὖν Πριηνεῖς, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν, ὀρθῶς ἵσταντο, φάσκοντες μηδενὶ προήσεσθαι τὰ χρήματα ζῶντος Ὀροφέρνους πλὴν αὐτῷ τῷ παραθεμένῳ·	But they acted like honest men, in my opinion, in declaring that they would deliver it to no one as long as Orophernes was alive, except to the person who deposited it with them
εἰ δὲ ἐκεῖνοι καταγνοῖεν, τότε καὶ αὐτὸς τὰ ὀνόματα ἐρεῖν ἔφασκε τῶν ἀνδρῶν.	After their condemnation, he said, he would himself disclose the names of the culprits.
οὐκοῦν ὅταν δικαίως πεισθῶσιν δικασταὶ περὶ ὧν ἰδόντι μόνον ἔστιν εἰδέναι, ἄλλως δὲ μή, ταῦτα τότε ἐξ ἀκοῆς κρίνοντες, ἀληθῆ δόξαν λαβόντες, ἄνευ ἐπιστήμης ἔκριναν, ὀρθὰ πεισθέντες, εἴπερ εὖ ἐδίκασαν;	Then when judges are justly persuaded about matters which one can know only by having seen them and in no other way, in such a case, judging of them from hearsay, having acquired a true opinion of them, they have judged without knowledge, though they are rightly persuaded, if the judgement they have passed is correct, have they not?
ἐς δὲ τοῦ ναοῦ τὸ ἐσωτάτω, παρίασί τε ἐς αὐτὸ ὀλίγοι καὶ χρυσοῦν Ἀπόλλωνος ἕτερον ἄγαλμα ἀνάκειται.	Into the innermost part of the temple there pass but few, but there is dedicated in it another image of Apollo, made of gold.
διαφέρει γὰρ τῇ ὕλῃ, ἐπεὶ διὰ τί ἄπειρα ἐγένετο ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ἕν; ὁ γὰρ νοῦς εἷς, ὥστ᾽ εἰ καὶ ἡ ὕλη μία, ἐκεῖνο ἐγένετο ἐνεργείᾳ οὗ ἡ ὕλη ἦν δυνάμει. τρία δὴ τὰ αἴτια καὶ τρεῖς αἱ ἀρχαί, δύο μὲν ἡ ἐναντίωσις, ἧς τὸ μὲν λόγος καὶ εἶδος τὸ δὲ στέρησις, τὸ δὲ τρίτον ἡ ὕλη. μετὰ ταῦτα ὅτι οὐ γίγνεται οὔτε ἡ ὕλη οὔτε τὸ εἶδος, λέγω δὲ τὰ ἔσχατα. πᾶν γὰρ μεταβάλλει τὶ καὶ ὑπό τινος καὶ εἴς τι· ὑφ᾽ οὗ μέν, τοῦ πρώτου κινοῦντος	therefore besides the contraries there is some third thing, the matter. now if change is of four kinds, in respect either of substance or of quality or of quantity or of place, and if change of substance is generation or destruction in the simple sense, and change of quantity is increase or decrease, and change of affection is alteration, and change of place is locomotion, then changes must be in each case into the corresponding contrary state. it must be the matter, then, which admits of both contraries,
οἱ δὲ περὶ φύσεως, οἷον Ἐμπεδοκλῆς ὡς εἰς γνωριμώτερον ἀνάγων λέγει ὅ τι τὸ ἕν ἐστιν·	But the physicists, e.g. Empedocles, explain what Unity is by reducing it to something, as it were, more intelligibleor it would seem that by Love Empedocles means Unity
ἢ οὕτως γε πάντων ἔσται; καὶ γὰρ τοῦ νοῆσαι καὶ βουλεύσασθαι·	Or, on that showing, will not fortune be the cause of everythingeven of thought and deliberation?
ἀφίκετο δὲ καὶ Φαρνάβαζος Ἀγησιλάῳ εἰς λόγους καὶ διωμολόγησεν, εἰ μὴ αὐτὸς πάσης τῆς στρατιᾶς στρατηγὸς κατασταθείη, ἀποστήσεσθαι βασιλέως·	And Pharnabazus too came and parleyed with Agesilaus, and made agreement with him that if he were not himself appointed the Persian general, he would revolt from the Great King.
καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ στῆναι λειτουργεῖν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς νεφέλης, ὅτι ἐνέπλησεν δόξα Κυρίου τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ.	The priests were not able to stand to perform their duties before the cloud because the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.
τὰ δ’ ἄκρα τοῖς προμαχῶσι καὶ ταῖς τύρσεσιν † ἡ περιαυτοῦ κεκόσμητο. πηχῶν δ’ ἦν τὸ πᾶν ὕψος ὡς ἐνενήκοντα, καὶ τὸ μὲν σχῆμα παρεῴκει τῷ κατὰ τὴν Φάρον ἐκπυρσεύοντι τοῖς ἐπὶ Ἀλεξανδρείας πλέουσι, τῇ περιοχῇ δὲ πολὺ μείζων ἦν·	It was also adorned with battlements and turrets, more than was the foregoing, and the entire altitude was about ninety cubits the appearance of it resembled the tower of Pharus, which exhibited a fire to such as sailed to Alexandria, but was much larger than it in compass.
ἐὰν δὲ θυσία ἀπὸ ἐσχάρας τὸ δῶρόν σου, ἐν ἐλαίῳ ποιηθήσεται.	And if it is a sacrifice from a hearth, your offering shall be prepared with olive oil.
Ῥείης ἠυκόμου θύγατερ, Δήμητερ ἄνασσα, εἰδήσεις·	“Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth
τοῦτο δέ, τῶν βρωμάτων ὅσα ἡμῖν ἀνεπιτήδειά ἐστιν καὶ λυμαίνεται τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐμπεσόντα, τούτων ἓν ἕκαστον ἢ πικρόν ἐστιν ἢ ἁλμυρὸν ἢ ὀξὺ ἢ ἄλλο τι ἄκρητόν τε καὶ ἰσχυρόν, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ταρασσόμεθα ὑπ’ αὐτῶν, ὥσπερ καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τῷ σώματι ἀποκρινομένων.	Moreover, of the foods that are unsuitable for us and hurt a man when taken, each one of them is either bitter, or salt, or acid, or something else uncompounded and strong, and for this reason we are disordered by them, just as we are by the secretions separated off in the body.
Σωσικράτης δ’ ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ τῆς Διαδοχῆς καὶ Σάτυρος ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ τῶν Βίων οὐδὲν εἶναι Διογένους φασί· τά τε τραγῳδάριά φησιν ὁ Σάτυρος Φιλίσκου εἶναι τοῦ Αἰγινήτου, γνωρίμου τοῦ Διογένους.	Sosicrates in the first book of his Successions, and Satyrus in the fourth book of his Lives, allege that Diogenes left nothing in writing, and Satyrus adds that the sorry tragedies are by his friend Philiscus, the Aeginetan.
καὶ ὡς προσέμειξαν τοῖς μετὰ τοῦ Δημοσθένους ὑστέροις τ’ οὖσι καὶ σχολαίτερον καὶ ἀτακτότερον χωροῦσιν, ὡς τῆς νυκτὸς τότε ξυνεταράχθησαν, εὐθὺς προσπεσόντες ἐμάχοντο, καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς τῶν Συρακοσίων ἐκυκλοῦντό τε ῥᾷον αὐτοὺς δίχα δὴ ὄντας καὶ ξυνῆγον ἐς ταὐτό.	When they were come up to those with Demosthenes, who were the hindmost and had marched more slowly and disorderly than the other part had done, as having been put into disorder in the night, they fell upon them and fought. And the Syracusian horsemen hemmed them in and forced them up into a narrow compass, the more easily now because they were divided from the rest.
τοιοῦτοι τότ’ ἐγένοντο οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι κολακείας θηρίου χαλεπωτάτου λύσσαν ἐμβαλούσης αὐτῶν τῇ πόλει· ἣν ὁ μὲν Πύθιος ἑστίαν τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀνεκήρυξε, πρυτανεῖον δὲ Ἑλλάδος ὁ δυσμενέστατος Θεόπομπος ὁ φήσας ἐν ἄλλοις πλήρεις εἶναι τὰς Ἀθήνας Διονυσοκολάκων καὶ ναυτῶν καὶ λωποδυτῶν, ἔτι δὲ ψευδομαρτύρων καὶ συκοφαντῶν καὶ ψευδοκλητήρων.	Such were the Athenians at that time, after flattery, that worst of wild beasts, had inspired their city with frenzy, that city which once the Pythia entitled the Hearth of Greece, and which Theopompus, who hated them, called the Prytaneum of Greece he who said in other places that Athens was full of drunken flatterers, and sailors, and pickpockets, and also of false witnesses, sycophants, and false accusers.
’ Θεόπομπός τε ἐν εἰκοστῇ πρώτῃ Φιλιππικῶν μνημονεύει αὐτῶν καὶ Δίφιλος ὁ Σίφνιος ἰατρὸς ἐν τῷ περὶ τῶν Προσφερομένων τοῖς ὑγιαίνουσι καὶ τοῖς νοσοῦσιν.	But Theopompus, in the twenty-first book of his History of Philip, mentions them, and Diphilus, the physician of Siphnus, also speaks of them, in his treatise on What may be eaten by People in Health, and by Invalids.
Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὰς ἠρημωμένας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ λέγουσιν Εἷς ἦν Ἀβραὰμ καὶ κατέσχεν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἡμεῖς πλείους ἐσμέν, ἡμῖν δέδοται ἡ γῆ εἰς κατάσχεσιν.	“Son of man, those who inhabit the deserted cities on the land of Israel will say, ‘Abraham was one person and he possessed the land, but we are more, the land has been given to us for a possession.’
ὅταν μὲν οὖν νεωστὶ κατεαγῇ, οἱ τετρωμένοι σπουδάζουσιν, οἰόμενοι μέζον τὸ κακὸν εἶναι, ἢ ὅσον ἐστίν· οἵ τε ἰητροὶ προθυμέονται δῆθεν ὀρθῶς ἰῆσθαι·	When, then, a fracture has recently taken place, the patients attach much importance to it, as supposing the mischief greater than it really is, and the physicians bestow great pains in order that it may be properly bandaged
ὅσοις διδακτὸν μηδέν, ἀλλ’ ἐν τῇ φύσει τὸ σωφρονεῖν εἴληχεν ἐς τὰ πάνθ’ ὁμῶς, τούτοις δρέπεσθαι, τοῖς κακοῖσι δ’ οὐ θέμις.	Such as know no cunning lore, yet in whose nature self-control, made perfect, hath a home, these may pluck the flowers, but not the wicked world.
Ὁ καταβάς, αὐτός ἐστιν καὶ ὁ ἀναβὰς ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν, ἵνα πληρώσῃ τὰ πάντα.	He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)
δικάζων εἰ δῶρα τις λάβοι, θάνατος ἡ ζημία.	If any judge takes bribes, his punishment is death
ἡ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῦτον πρόσβασις ἔστω μὴ διὰ βαθμίδων, ἀλλὰ προσχώσεως αὐτῷ καταπρανοῦς γενομένης.	Let the ascent to it be not by steps but by an acclivity of raised earth.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλ’ εἰ δεῖ πάντα τἄλλα παραλιπόντα συντόμως εἰπεῖν, ὑμεῖς ἔδοτε πολιτείαν Εὐαγόρᾳ τῷ Κυπρίῳ καὶ Διονυσίῳ τῷ Συρακοσίῳ καὶ τοῖς ἐκγόνοις τοῖς ἐκείνων.	However, if I may mention two instances to the exclusion of the rest, you gave your citizenship to Evagoras of Cyprus and to Dionysius of Syracuse, to them and their descendants.
περαιώσας δὲ τὸν στρατὸν εἰς Ἀσίαν ἤδη λαμπρὸν ὄντα, ναυτικὸν μὲν ἐξηρτύετο στόλον ἐν Βιθυνίᾳ καὶ περὶ Κύζικον, πεζῇ δ’ αὐτὸς ἐπιὼν καθίστατο τὰς πόλεις καὶ τοῖς δυνάσταις ἐχρημάτιζε, καὶ πρὸς Κάσσιον ἔπεμπεν εἰς Συρίαν ἀπ’ Αἰγύπτου μετακαλῶν·	He now crossed into Asia with his army, which was already a splendid one, and equipped a fleet in Bithynia and at Cyzicus, while he himself, proceeding by land, settled the affairs of the cities and gave audiences to the potentates of the country. He also sent to Cassius in Syria, recalling him from his expedition to Egypt
πρότερον δὲ ἔτι τούτων ἐσβαλόντος ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν Κασσάνδρου πλεύσας Ὀλυμπιόδωρος ἐς Αἰτωλίαν βοηθεῖν Αἰτωλοὺς ἔπεισε, καὶ τὸ συμμαχικὸν τοῦτο ἐγένετο Ἀθηναίοις αἴτιον μάλιστα διαφυγεῖν τὸν Κασσάνδρου πόλεμον.	Still earlier than this, when Cassander had invaded Attica, Olympiodorus sailed to Aetolia and induced the Aetolians to help. This allied force was the main reason why the Athenians escaped war with Cassander.
Κρατῖνος Ὥραις · ὥσπερ ὁ Περσικὸς ὥραν πᾶσαν καναχῶν ὁλόφωνος ἀλέκτωρ.	And Cratinus, in his Seasons, says— Like the Persian loud-voiced cock (ἀλέκτωρ), Who every hour sings his song.
ἐντέροισι γίγνεται μὲν φλεγμονὴ, ὀδύνην ὀλεθρίην ἐμποιοῦσα. θνήσκουσι γὰρ μυρίοι στρόφοισι καρτεροῖσι ·	AN inflammation takes place in the intestines, creating a deadly pain, for many die of intense tormina
ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ πλείους ἧκον, οὐ μόνον τὸ γεγονός, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ κατὰ μέρος διασαφοῦντες, τότε δὴ χαρᾶς ὑπερβαλλούσης ἦν ἡ πόλις πλήρης, καὶ πᾶν μὲν τέμενος ἐκοσμεῖτο, πᾶς δὲ ναὸς ἔγεμε πελάνων καὶ θυμάτων, καθόλου δ’ εἰς τοιαύτην εὐελπιστίαν παρεγένοντο καὶ θάρσος ὥστε πάντας τὸν Ἀννίβαν, ὃν μάλιστα πρότερον ἐφοβήθησαν, τότε μηδ’ ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ νομίζειν παρεῖναι.	but when still more men arrived, not only stating the fact, but giving full details, then indeed the city was filled with overpowering joy every temple-court was decked, and every shrine full of sacrificial cakes and victims and, in a word, they were raised to such a pitch of hopefulness and confidence, that every one felt sure that Hannibal, formerly the object of their chief terror, could not after that stay even in Italy.
ἐρρύη δὲ πλεῖστος ἑαυτοῦ καὶ μέγιστος τότε ὁ Εὐρώτας, χιόνων γενομένων, καὶ τὸ ῥεῦμα μᾶλλον ὑπὸ ψυχρότητος ἢ τραχύτητος ἐγένετο σκληρὸν καὶ χαλεπὸν τοῖς Θηβαίοις.	Now, the Eurotas at this time was flowing at its fullest and deepest, since snows had fallen, and its current, even more from its coldness than its violence, was very troublesome to the Thebans.
σὺ γὰρ ἐμοὶ ὧντινων μὲν καὶ ὅπως ἤκουσας μηδ’ ἂν κελεύω εἴπῃς, τοῦτο δὲ αὐτὸ ὃ λέγεις ποίησον·	Don’t tell, even if I beg you, how or from whom you heard it only do as you say
οὕτω γὰρ ἂν ὡς τὸ εἰκὸς μάλιστα δύναιτο βλάπτων τοὺς ἐναντίους μὴ βλάπτεσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν.	For in this way you have the best chance of injuring the enemy without coming to harm yourself.
εἰ γάρ τι καὶ σμικρὸν ἐθέλουσι τῶν ὄντων συγχωρεῖν ἀσώματον, ἐξαρκεῖ.	for if they are willing to admit that any existence, no matter how small, is incorporeal, that is enough.
Μωυσῆς δὲ τὴν Κορέου διαβολὴν ἐκ πολλοῦ προειδὼς καὶ τὸν λαὸν παροξυνόμενον ἰδὼν οὐκ ἔδεισεν, ἀλλὰ θαρρῶν οἷς περὶ τῶν πραγμάτων καλῶς ἐβουλεύετο καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν εἰδὼς κατὰ τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ προαίρεσιν τῆς ἱερωσύνης τυχεῖν, ἀλλ’ οὐ κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ χάριν, ἧκεν εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν.	Now although Moses had a great while ago foreseen this calumny of Corah, and had seen the people were irritated, yet was he not affrighted at it but being of good courage, because given them right advice about their affairs, and knowing that his brother had been made partaker of the priesthood at the command of God, and not by his own favor to him, he came to the assembly
ἐπεὶ τοὺς γε μοχθηρούς, ὅσῳ μᾶλλον ἐπιλαμβάνονται καὶ συμπλέκονται, καθάπερ βάτους καὶ ἀπαρίνας ὑπερβατέον ἐστί·	For as to ill-humored persons, the more they seize and take hold of us like thorns, we should endeavor to free ourselves from them or leap over them the more.
καὶ θάνε φοιτηταῖς ἄμμιγα τοῖς ἰδίοις.	Why did he fall in the midst of his disciples?
ὡς δὲ συνέδραμον πάντες εἰς τὸ προειρημένον ὄρος Ἀχάβου διαπέμψαντος, σταθεὶς αὐτῶν ὁ προφήτης Ἠλίας μεταξύ, μέχρι πότε διῃρημένους αὐτοὺς τῇ διανοίᾳ καὶ ταῖς δόξαις οὕτως βιώσειν ἔφασκε·	And as all the men whom Ahab sent for ran away to the forenamed mountain, the prophet Elijah stood in the midst of them, and said, "How long will you live thus in uncertainty of mind and opinion?"
Βορέας δι’ ἐρωτικὴν ἐπιθυμίαν Χιόνην ἁρπάσας τὴν Ἀρκτούρου θυγατέρα κατήνεγκεν εἰς τινα λόφον Νιφάντην καλούκενον καὶ ἐγέννησεν ἐκ τῆς προειρημένης υἱὸν Ὕρπακα τὸν διαδεξάμενον Ἡνιόχου τὴν βασιλείαν.	Passionate desire caused Boreas to abduct Chione, daughter of Arctouros. He carried her down to a ridge called Niphante and he fathered with the aforementioned woman a son Hyrpax who succeed to the kingdom of Heriochos.
ἡ μὲν τουτουὶ Λακρίτου πονηρία τοιαύτη ἐστίν·	Such is the rascality of this fellow, Lacritus
τῷ γὰρ ὄντι τὰς μὲν ἀλλήλων νοήσεις οἷον ὑπὸ σκότῳ διὰ φωνῆς ψηλαφῶντες γνωρίζομεν·	We, it is true, as it were groping in the dark, find out one another’s conceptions by the voice
ἧψε, μοὐδόκει, πνικτόν τι ὄψον δελφάκειον, ΓΛ.	He boil'd, it seem'd to me, some pork, from off A pig who died by suffocation. B.
ἀλλὰ τοῦτο δεῖ καταμαθεῖν τὸν μέλλοντα ὀρθῶς θεραπεύσειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους.	he who would treat patients properly must, they say, learn this.
χόνδροι δὲ οἵ τε πλυτοὶ χαρίεντες ξὺν οἴνῳ, καὶ μέλιτι ὅσον ἡδῦναι· καὶ τὸ ἐκ τουτέων Ῥόφημα καὶ οἱ ξὺν ἁπλοῖσι ζωμοῖσι.	Granulated spelt (alica) when washed, is pleasant along with wine and honey, so as to sweeten, and, in like manner, their soups, and with plain broths.
τό τε γὰρ τοῖς ἄρχουσι πείθεσθαι πᾶσιν ἐν κοινῷ κεῖται, καὶ ὃς ἂν φανῇ τοῦτο ἀπροφασίστως ποιῶν, τοῦτον ὁρῶ παρὰ Κύρου τιμῆς τυγχάνοντα·	For obedience to the officers has been enjoined equally upon us all, and whoever shows himself prompt to comply, I observe that he receives honour from Cyrus.
θεοὺς δ’, οἳ γᾶν ἔχουσιν ἀεὶ τίοιεν ἐγχωρίοις πατρῴαις δαφνηφόροις βουθύτοισι τιμαῖς.	And may they worship forever the gods who possess the land with native honors of laurel bough held aloft, and oxen slain, even as their fathers did before their time.
ὑδρίαι εἴκοσι καὶ ἕξ, ἀμφορεῖς Παναθηναικοὶ δεκαέξ, ψυκτῆρες ἑκατὸν ἑξήκοντα· τούτων ὁ μέγιστος ἦν μετρητῶν ἕξ, ὁ δὲ ἐλάχιστος δύο.	And six-and-twenty water-cans, and sixteen Panathenaic jars, and a hundred and sixty wine-coolers, the largest of which contained six measures, and the smallest contained two
Μηνᾶς δὲ ὑποκρινόμενος τότε πρῶτον ᾐσθῆσθαι Νικομήδους παρόντος, ἐς τοὺς δισχιλίους διαδραμὼν ἐδυσφόρει. προϊὼν δὲ τῷ λόγῳ, δύο, ἔφη, βασιλέοιν, τοῦ μὲν ὄντος ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τοῦ δ’ ἐπιόντος, ἀναγκαῖον ἡμῖν τὸ σφέτερον εὖ διατίθεσθαι καὶ τοῦ γενησομένου καλῶς τεκμαίρεσθαι, ὡς ἐν τῷδε τῆς ἡμετέρας σωτηρίας βεβαιουμένης, ἢν καλῶς προϊδώμεθα πότερος αὐτῶν ἐπικρατήσει.	Menas, pretending that he had then for the first time learned that Nicomedes was present, rushed to his 2000 men and exclaimed with assumed trepidation, "Since we have two kings, one at home and the other going there, we must look out for our own interests, and form a careful judgment of the future, because our safety lies in foreseeing correctly which of them will be the stronger.
τὰν δ’ ἄπληστον κακῶν μήποτ’ ἐν πόλει στάσιν τᾷδ’ ἐπεύχομαι βρέμειν. μηδὲ πιοῦσα κόνις μέλαν αἷμα πολιτᾶν δι’ ὀργὰν ποινᾶς ἀντιφόνους ἄτας ἁρπαλίσαι πόλεως.	I pray that discord, greedy for evil, may never clamor in this city, and may the dust not drink the black blood of its people and through passion cause ruinous murder for vengeance to the destruction of the state.
οὕτω μέντοι, ἔφη ὁ Ἱέρων, καὶ τῶν σίτων ὁ μὲν ἔχων παντοδαπὰ ἀεὶ οὐδὲν μετὰ πόθου αὐτῶν λαμβάνει·	Quite so, and we may add that he who has all sorts of food at all times has no stomach for any sort.
κατετάχησε γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ἀννίβας, ἐξελὼν τὴν Ζακανθαίων πόλιν.	For Hannibal anticipated their measures by the capture of Saguntum
ὁπόσαι δ᾽ ἐξαπατῶσιν παραβαίνουσί τε τοὺς ὅρκους τοὺς νενομισμένους κερδῶν οὕνεκ᾽ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ, ἢ ψηφίσματα καὶ νόμον ζητοῦσ᾽ ἀντιμεθιστάναι, τἀπόρρητά τε τοῖσιν ἐχθροῖς τοῖς ἡμετέροις λέγουσ᾽, ἢ Μήδους ἐπάγουσι γῇ κερδῶν οὕνεκ᾽ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ, ἀσεβοῦσιν ἀδικοῦσίν τε τὴν πόλιν. ἀλλ᾽ ὦ παγκρατὲς Ζεῦ ταῦτα κυρώσειας, ὥσθ᾽ ἡμῖν θεοὺς παραστατεῖν καίπερ γυναιξὶν οὔσαις. ἄκουε πᾶς.	but woe to those women who break their oaths, who speculate on the public misfortune, who seek to alter the laws and the decrees, who reveal our secrets to the foe and admit the medes into our territory so that they may devastate it! i declare them both impious and criminal. oh! almighty zeus! see to it that the gods protect us, albeit we are but women! hearken, all of you!
καὶ διὰ ταῦτ’ οὖν τῆς μὲν κακίας ἡ ὑπερβολὴ καὶ ἡ ἔλλειψις, τῆς δ’ ἀρετῆς ἡ μεσότης·	so this is another reason why excess and deficiency are a mark of vice, and observance of the mean a mark of virtue
εἰ δὲ καὶ Φίλιστος αἰτίαν δικαίαν εἴληφεν, ἐπελπίζων τὴν ἐν Συρακούσαις κάθοδον, ἀποκρύψασθαι τῶν Διονυσίου τὰ ἀνοσιώτατα, ἦ που πολλή γε Ἱερωνύμῳ συγγνώμη τὰ ἐς ἡδονὴν Ἀντιγόνου γράφειν.	If Philistus was justified in suppressing the most wicked deeds of Dionysius, because he expected his return to Syracuse, surely Hieronymus may be fully forgiven for writing to please Antigonus.
οὐκ οὖν καὶ τῷ Ἀχιλλεῖ τοῦτο αἴτιον τοῦ πενθεῖν, οὐχ ὁ τοῦ Πατρόκλου θάνατος ἄλλος γάρ τις οὐ πάσχει ταῦτα τοῦ ἑταίρου ἀποθανόντος , ἀλλ’ ὅτι ἔδοξεν αὐτῷ.	This then was the cause of Achilles’ lamentation, not the death of Patroclus for another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion but it was because he chose to do so.
ἐκείνων ἐστὶ ταῦτα.	To such persons do these things belong.
καὶ νόσων αὐτοὺς ἰδέαι πᾶσαι κατελάμβανον ἔκ τε πονηρίας τροφῶν καὶ ἀκινησίας ἔργων καὶ ὥρας ἔτους· συνεκέκλειστο γὰρ ἐς ἓν χωρίον καὶ στενὸν στρατόπεδον ὄχλος ἀνθρώπων ἐν Λιβύῃ θέρους.	They also fell sick of various diseases due to lack of food, want of exercise, and the season, for they were enclosed in one place and in a contracted camp -- a great multitude of men exposed to the heat of an African summer.
μουνοπάλης νικῶ δὶς Ὀλύμπια Πύθιά τ’ ἄνδρας, τρὶς Νεμέᾳ, τετράκις δ’ Ἰσθμῷ ἐν ἀγχιάλῳ, Χίλων Χίλωνος Πατρεύς, ὃν λαὸς Ἀχαιῶν ἐν πολέμῳ φθίμενον θάψ’ ἀρετῆς ἕνεκεν.	In wrestling only I alone conquered twice the men at Olympia and at Pytho,Thrice at Nemea, and four times at the Isthmus near the sea Chilon of Patrae, son of Chilon, whom the Achaean folkBuried for my valour when I died in battle.
οὐ καιρίου δ’ αὐτῷ τῆς πληγῆς γενομένης, ἐκέλευσε τὸν παῖδα ἐπερεῖσαι.	As the wound was not mortal he ordered a slave to drive the weapon in.
ταχὺ γὰρ ἐξανθεῖ τὸ μίλτινον, ᾧ τὰ παλαιὰ τῶν ἀγαλμάτων ἔχρωζον.	for the red pigment, with which they used to tint ancient statues, rapidly loses its freshness.
τοῦτο γὰρ περιείληφε τὰ κατὰ μέρος ζῷα.	Animal for this includes all particular animals.
ἁλίσκεται δὴ τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ ἀποθνήσκει Δομέτιος. τῶν δὲ πόλεων αἱ μὲν εὐθὺς ὑπήκουον, αἱ δὲ κατὰ κράτος ἐλήφθησαν, εἷλε δὲ καὶ τῶν βασιλέων Ἰάρφαν τὸν συμμαχήσαντα Δομετίῳ, τὴν δὲ βασιλείαν Ἰάμψᾳ παρέδωκε.	Then some of the cities submitted at once to Pompey, and others were taken by storm. King Iarbus also, the confederate of Domitius, was captured, and his kingdom given to Hiempsal.
καὶ τοῦ μὲν πατρός ἐστι κρείττων, τῶν δ’ αἰσχρῶν ἥττων·	He lords it over his own father but submits to degenerates.
ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος ἐθαύμασεν εἰ ἤδη τέθνηκεν, καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος τὸν κεντυρίωνα ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν εἰ πάλαι ἀπέθανεν.	Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time.
ἀλλὰ ξυντεκμαίρεσθαι τὰς δυνάμιας καὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸν τρόπον.	But we must estimate the powers and habits of the patient.
αὐτόθεν δὴ διανοήθητε ἢ ὑπακούειν πρίν τι βλαβῆναι, ἢ εἰ πολεμήσομεν, ὥσπερ ἔμοιγε ἄμεινον δοκεῖ εἶναι, καὶ ἐπὶ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐπὶ βραχείᾳ ὁμοίως προφάσει μὴ εἴξοντες μηδὲ ξὺν φόβῳ ἕξοντες ἃ κεκτήμεθα·	"Resolve therefore from this occasion either to yield them obedience before you receive damage, or if we must have war (which for my part I think is best), be the pretence weighty or light, not to give way nor keep what we possess in fear.
σωφροσύνη δὲ σωτηρία οὗ νυνδὴ ἐσκέμμεθα, φρονήσεως.	Σωφροσύνη (self-restraint) is σωτηρία (salvation) of φρόνησις (wisdom), which we have just been discussing.
καὶ ἐν τῇ θ δὲ τῶν ἱστοριῶν φησι· βασιλήιον δεῖπνον βασιλεὺς προτίθεται, τοῦτο δὲ παρασκευάζεται ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρῃ τῇ ἐγένετο ὁ βασιλεύς, οὔνομα δὲ τῷ δείπνῳ Περσιστὶ μὲν τυκτά, Ἑλληνιστὶ δὲ τέλειον.	And in the ninth book of his Histories, the same author tells us, The king provides a royal entertainment and this is provided once every year, on the day on which the king was born. And the name of this feast is in Persian τυκτὰ, but in Greek τέλειον
εἰκότως οὖν ἡ πυγμὴ προῆγε, δευτέραν δ’ εἶχεν ἡ πάλη τάξιν, καὶ τελευταίαν ὁ δρόμος·	And therefore it is likely that cuffing is set first, wrestling next, and racing last
ἀναλαβεῖν δὲ καὶ διαναπαῦσαι τὸν στρατὸν οὐχ ὑπῆρξεν αὐτῷ· ταχὺ γὰρ αἴσθησιν τοῖς βαρβάροις ἀφικόμενος παρέσχε, καὶ κατεφρονήθη πεζῶν μὲν ὀλίγων παντάπασιν ὄντων σὺν αὐτῷ, τὸ δ’ ἱππικὸν ἐν οὐδενὶ λόγῳ τῶν Κελτῶν τιθεμένων, κράτιστοι γὰρ ὄντες ἱππομαχεῖν καὶ μάλιστα τούτῳ διαφέρειν δοκοῦντες, τότε καὶ πλήθει πολὺ τὸν Μάρκελλον ὑπερέβαλλον.	There was no time for him to give his army rest and refreshment, for the Barbarians quickly learned of his arrival, and held in contempt the infantry with him, which were few in number all told, and, being Gauls, made no account of his cavalry. For they were most excellent fighters on horseback, and were thought to be specially superior as such, and, besides, at this time they far outnumbered Marcellus.
οὐ μανθάνεις, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, ὅτι πρῶτον τοῖς παιδίοις μύθους λέγομεν; τοῦτο δέ που ὡς τὸ ὅλον εἰπεῖν ψεῦδος, ἔνι δὲ καὶ ἀληθῆ.	Don’t you understand, I said, that we begin by telling children fables, and the fable is, taken as a whole, false, but there is truth in it also?
τούτων τότε τῶν Ἀλβησέων ἐς Ῥώμην δισχίλιοι δρόμῳ διέθεον, τοῦ κινδύνου μετασχεῖν, καὶ ἅμα ἀφικνοῦντο καὶ ὡπλίζοντο καὶ τὰς πύλας ἐφρούρουν.	Two thousand of these Albenses hastened to Rome to share the danger. As soon as they arrived they armed themselves and mounted guard at the gates.
παρὰ πάντα τὸν τοῦ βίου χρόνον καὶ ἐν λόγοις ἐπαινεθείς·	He was always accounted honest his orations were commended for the eloquence they carried in them
τὰς ἀντικειμένας ἄρα οὐκ ἐνδέχεται φάσεις καὶ ἀποφάσεις ἀληθεύειν κατὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ.	yes, but matter does not exist actually, but only potentially.
ὑπάρχει δ’ ἡ γένεσις εὐθὺς ἐξ ἐναντίων ἑκατέρᾳ τῶν μοναρχιῶν·	And these two different sorts of monarchy have their origins from directly opposite sources
πολλάκι δ’ ἀσταφίδας προχέαις τριπτῆρι λεήνας σπέρματά τ’ ἐνδάκνοντα σινήπυος.	And often 'twill be well to pound fresh raisins, And add them gently, scattering in some seeds Of biting mustard
ἔστι δ’ οὖν μετὰ τὸν Μεσσηνιακὸν κόλπον ὁ Λακωνικὸς μεταξὺ Ταινάρου καὶ Μαλεῶν, ἐκκλίνων μικρὸν ἀπὸ μεσημβρίας πρὸς ἕω·	NEXT after the Messenian is the Laconian Gulf, situated between Tnarum and Male, declining a little from the south to the east.
παραγενόμενος δ' ἐκ τῆς Μωαβίτιδος ὁ τῶν Ἰσραηλιτῶν βασιλεὺς εἰς Σαμάρειαν εἶχε σὺν αὑτῷ τὸν προφήτην Ἐλισσαῖον, οὗ τὰς πράξεις βούλομαι διελθεῖν, λαμπραὶ γάρ εἰσι καὶ ἱστορίας ἄξιαι, καθὼς ἐν ταῖς ἱεραῖς βίβλοις ἐπεγνώκαμεν.	When the king of Israel came from Moab to Samaria, he had with him Eliseus the prophet, whose acts I want to treat of in particular, for as we have found them in the sacred books they are illustrious and worthy of recording.
χαίρω γὰρ πάνυ τῷ ἀνδρὶ διά τε τὴν πολυμαθίαν καὶ τὴν τοῦ ἤθους ἐπιείκειαν.	for he is an author of whom I am very fond, on account of his great learning and his gentle good-humoured disposition.
καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἄνθρωπος καταδιώκων σε καὶ ζητῶν τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ ἔσται ψυχὴ κυρίου μου ἐνδεδεμένη ἐν δεσμῷ τῆς ζωῆς παρὰ Κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ, καὶ ψυχὴν ἐχθρῶν σου σφενδονήσεις ἐν μέσῳ τῆς σφενδόνης.	And a man might rise chasing after you and seeking your life. But the life of my master will be bound with a bound of life beside the Lord God, and the life of your enemy will be thrown in the midst of a sling.
Τοῦτο πρῶτον ἁπάντων τὴν θαυμαστὴν ὁμόνοιαν ἡμῖν ἐμπεποίηκεν· τὸ γὰρ μίαν μὲν ἔχειν καὶ τὴν αὐτὴν δόξαν περὶ θεοῦ, τῷ βίῳ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἔθεσι μηδὲν ἀλλήλων διαφέρειν, καλλίστην ἐν ἤθεσιν ἀνθρώπων συμφωνίαν ἀποτελεῖ.	Our total agreement in all our ideas about God has forged this remarkable harmony among us and our consistency in our lifestyle and practices produces among us the highest uniformity of practice that is found on earth.
περὶ οὓς τόπους ὑπὸ Ὀυεντιδίου Πάκορος διεφθάρη, ὁ πρεσβύτατος τῶν τοῦ Παρθυαίου παίδων, ἐπιστρατεύσας τῇ Συρίᾳ.	It was near these places that Pacorus, the eldest of the sons of the Parthian king, who had invaded Syria, was defeated by Ventidius, and killed.
νυνὶ μέντοι βραχύ τί μοι περὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπόκριναι· καὶ γάρ με εἰς καλὸν ὑπέμνησας.	Now, however, give me a brief answer to a question about your discourse, for you reminded me of the beautiful just at the right moment.
τίς δὲ μισεῖ τὸν ἄριστον τῶν ὑπηρετῶν τῶν ἑαυτοῦ; οὐδ’ ἀμελῶν, ὅς γε οὐδὲ τῶν μικροτάτων τινὸς ἀμελεῖ, ἀλλὰ γυμνάζων καὶ μάρτυρι πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους χρώμενος.	for who hates the most faithful of his servants?—nor that he neglects me, for he neglects not one of the smallest things but to exercise me, and make use of me as a witness to others.
Ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν καιρὸν ἀποθανόντος καὶ Ὀνίου τοῦ ἀρχιερέως τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην Ἀντίοχος δίδωσιν·	About this time, upon the death of Onias the high priest, they gave the high priesthood to Jesus his brother
καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν ἐπισιτισμὸν τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς κερατίνας αὐτῶν· καὶ τὸν πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραὴλ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἄνδρα εἰς σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς τριακοσίους ἄνδρας κατίσχυσεν. καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ Μαδιὰμ ἦσαν αὐτοῦ ὑποκάτω ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι.	And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their horns and every man of Israel he sent forth each to his tent. But he strengthened the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
καὶ ἀπὸ μὲν τῆς πρώτης αὐτοῦ κτίσεως, ἣν κατεβάλετο Σολομὼν ὁ βασιλεύς; μέχρι τῆς νῦν ἀναιρέσεως, ἣ γέγονεν ἔτει δευτέρῳ τῆς Οὐεσπασιανοῦ ἡγεμονίας, ἔτη συνάγεται χίλια ἑκατὸν τριάκοντα, πρὸς δὲ μῆνες ἑπτὰ καὶ πεντεκαίδεκα ἡμέραι·	Now the number of years that passed from its first foundation, which was laid by king Solomon, till this its destruction, which happened in the second year of the reign of Vespasian, are collected to be one thousand one hundred and thirty, besides seven months and fifteen days
Εἶτα Ἑκαταῖος δηλοῖ πάλιν, πῶς ἔχομεν πρὸς τοὺς νόμους, ὅτι πάντα πάσχειν ὑπὲρ τοῦ μὴ παραβῆναι τούτους προαιρούμεθα καὶ καλὸν εἶναι νομίζομεν.	Hecateus again tells of our regard for our laws and how we are more than ready to endure anything rather than transgress them.
συνηθροίζετο οὖν καὶ Μισδαῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν καὶ ὑπέκλινεν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖρας Σιφόρου τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου·	Misdaeus the king therefore was also gathered among the brethren, and bowed his head under the hands of Siphor the priest
διὸ τῶν μὲν αἰχμαλώτων ἀπέπεμψε τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς τοὺς ἐπιφανεστάτους, τὸν δὲ σύλλογον ὑπερθέμενος ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς Λακεδαίμονα.	For this reason he sent back to the Achaeans the most prominent men among their captives, but postponed the conference and went back home to Sparta.
ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ αὐτός γε, ἔφη, καταγελάστως ἔχω, ὦ Σώκρατες.	But indeed I myself also, he said, am in a ridiculous position, Socrates.
ἢ καὶ τόπον ἔδει τῷ θριαμβεύσαντι κλισίας τὸν ἐντιμότατον ἀποδίδοσθαι καὶ προπομπὴν μετὰ τὸ δεῖπνον;	Was it that it was necessary to give the supreme place and most honorable entertainment to the triumpher, and wait upon him home after supper
οὐκ ἀκριβοῦνται δέ, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἄγνοιαν καὶ τὸν ἐκτοπισμὸν λέγεται πάντ’ ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον ἢ τὸ τερατωδέστερον·	Either through ignorance or from its remote situation, everything relative to it is exaggerated or partakes of the wonderful.
ἴθι, γενοῦ μοι τροφὴ καὶ τοῖς στασιασταῖς ἐρινὺς καὶ τῷ βίῳ μῦθος ὁ μόνος ἐλλείπων ταῖς Ἰουδαίων συμφοραῖς.	Come on be thou my food, and be thou a fury to these seditious varlets, and a by-word to the world, which is all that is now wanting to complete the calamities of us Jews."
μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο στρατοῖς μεγάλοις οἱ στασίαρχοι πολέμου νόμῳ συνεπλέκοντο ἀλλήλοις, καὶ ἡ πατρὶς ἆθλον ἔκειτο ἐν μέσῳ.	Afterward the chiefs of factions assailed each other with great armies, according to the usage of war, and the country lay as a prize between them.
ἔνιοι δέ φασιν οὐκ ἀρκούμενον οἷς ἐλάμβανεν εἰς τὸ καθ’ ἡμέραν δεῖπνον ἀποστῆναι βασιλέως, εὐήθη λέγοντες, εἰ γὰρ ἄλλο μηδέν, ἀλλὰ ἡ μήτηρ ὑπῆρχε, χρῆσθαι καὶ λαμβάνειν ὅσα βούλοιτο τῶν αὑτῆς παρέχουσα καὶ διδοῦσα, μαρτυρεῖ δὲ τῷ πλούτῳ καὶ τὸ μισθοφορικόν πολλαχόθι διὰ τῶν φίλων καὶ ξένων αὐτῷ παρατρεφόμενον, ὡς Ξενοφῶν εἴρηκεν.	Some say that he revolted from the king because his allowance did not suffice for his daily meals, which is absurd. For had no other resource been his, still, his mother was resource enough, who gave freely from her own wealth all that he wished to take and use. And that he had wealth is proved by the mercenary troops that were maintained for him in many places by his friends and connections, as Xenophon tells us.
ὅταν οὖν τάμνῃς ἕλκος ἐν κεφαλῇ ὀστέων εἵνεκα τῆς σαρκὸς ἐψιλωμένων, θέλων εἰδέναι εἴ τι ἔχει τὸ ὀστέον κακὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ βέλεος, ἢ καὶ οὐκ ἔχει, τάμνειν χρὴ τὸ μέγεθος τὴν ὠτειλὴν, ὅση ἂν δοκέῃ ἀποχρῆναι.	When, then, you lay open a wound in the head on account of the bones having been denuded of the flesh, as wishing to ascertain whether or not the bone has received an injury from the blow, you must make an incision proportionate to the size of the wound, and as much as shall be judged necessary.
εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ δειλίας καὶ ἀνανδρίας εἵνεκα δειχθήσεται τοῦτο πεποιηκώς, μὴ παρακρουσθῆτε.	If, on the other hand, it is proved that his motive was cowardice and malingering, do not be led astray.
ἐγώ τε γὰρ δέομαι ἀναπαύσασθαι, ὑμῶν τ’ ἐνίοις ἥδιον ὡς πλείστων τοὺς αὐτοὺς λόγους ἀκούειν.	for not only am I in need of a rest, but some of you will prefer to hear the same statements from as many persons as possible.
τὸν μὲν γὰρ πατέρ’ οὐδ’ ἂν αἰτιάσαιντο λαβεῖν τέτταρσι γὰρ ἢ τρισὶ μησὶν ὕστερον ἢ διελύσατο πρὸς τούτους ἐτελεύτησεν.	As for my father, they cannot charge that he received them for he died three or four months after the settlement was made with them
ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὑπὲρ τὴν ψυχήν σου.	Thou shalt love thy neighbour more than thy own life.
ἦν δὲ τὸ μὲν τῶν ἱππικῶν πλῆθος τὸ σύμπαν τοῖς Καρχηδονίοις εἰς μυρίους, τὸ δὲ τῶν πεζῶν οὐ πολὺ πλείους τετρακισμυρίων σὺν τοῖς Κελτοῖς.	The whole strength of the Carthaginian cavalry was ten thousand, but that of their foot was not more than forty thousand, including the Celts.
ταῦτα δ’, ἔφη, ἐγὼ προθυμοῦμαι, σῶσαι ὑμᾶς βουλόμενος διά τε τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς φιλίαν πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ διὰ τὸ προξενεῖν ὑμῶν.	And I am myself eager for this, he said, out of a desire to save you, both because of my father’s friendship with you and because I am your diplomatic agent.
νῦν δράμε εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐρεῖς Ἢ εἰρήνη σοι; ἢ εἰρήνη τῷ ἀνδρί σου; ἢ εἰρήνη τῷ παιδαρίῳ; ἡ δὲ εἶπεν Εἰρήνη.	Run to meet her and say, ‘Is there peace with you? Or is there peace with your husband? Or is there peace with the boy?’ ” She said, “There is peace.”
ἐνταῦθα δὴ προκαταλαβὼν Δημοσθένης τὸ βῆμα, οὐδενὶ τῶν ἄλλων παραλιπὼν λόγον, οὐδὲν ὄφελος ἔφη τῶν χθὲς εἰρημένων εἶναι λόγων, εἰ ταῦθ’ οἱ Φιλίππου μὴ συμπεισθήσονται πρέσβεις, οὐδὲ γιγνώσκειν ἔφη τὴν εἰρήνην ἀπούσης συμμαχίας.	Then it was that Demosthenes, hastening to get possession of the platform, and leaving no other man an opportunity to speak, said that the propositions of yesterday were utterly useless unless Philip's ambassadors could be persuaded to assent to them. He further said that he could not conceive of peace without alliance.
εἰ ἄρα τις ἐννοήσειεν ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ πόλει τῶν νέων, τίνα ἂν τρόπον ἐγὼ μέγα δυναίμην καὶ μηδείς με ἀδικοῖ; αὕτη, ὡς ἔοικεν, αὐτῷ ὁδός ἐστιν, εὐθὺς ἐκ νέου ἐθίζειν αὑτὸν τοῖς αὐτοῖς χαίρειν καὶ ἄχθεσθαι τῷ δεσπότῃ, καὶ παρασκευάζειν ὅπως ὅτι μάλιστα ὅμοιος ἔσται ἐκείνῳ.	Hence if one of the young men in that city should reflect In what way can I have great power, and no one may do me wrong?—this, it would seem, is the path he must take, to accustom himself from his earliest youth to be delighted and annoyed by the same things as his master, and contrive to be as like the other as possible.
ἀποκρίνασθαι δὲ πρὸς ταῦτα τὴν ἑορτὴν ἀληθῆ λέγεις, ἀλλ’ ἐμοῦ μὴ γενομένης οὐδ’ ἂν σὺ ἦς;	The Feast-day answered after this wise Thou speakest truth but if I had not been, neither hadst thou been.
σαφὲς δ’ ἐγένετο τῷ Δαρείῳ τῶν σατραπῶν παραβληθέντων τοῖς θηρίοις, ὅτι τὸ θεῖον ἔσωσε τὸν Δανίηλον· οὐδενὸς γὰρ αὐτῶν ἐφείσαντο οἱ λέοντες, ἀλλὰ πάντας διεσπάραττον ὡσανεὶ σφόδρα λιμώττοντες καὶ τροφῆς ἐνδεεῖς.	And it appeared plain to Darius, after the princes had been cast to the wild beasts, that it was God who preserved for the lions spared none of them, but tore them all to pieces, as if they had been very hungry, and wanted food.
τῶν δὲ πόλεων ὅσαι μὲν νεώτατα ᾠκίσθησαν καὶ ἤδη πλωιμωτέρων ὄντων, περιουσίας μᾶλλον ἔχουσαι χρημάτων ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς τείχεσιν ἐκτίζοντο καὶ τοὺς ἰσθμοὺς ἀπελάμβανον ἐμπορίας τε ἕνεκα καὶ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς προσοίκους ἕκαστοι ἰσχύος·	Whom the oftener you read, the more you shall carry away yet never be dismissed without appetite. Next to him is Polybius, &c. And thus much concerning the life and history of Thucydides. Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the war of the Peloponnesians and the Athenians as they warred against each other, beginning to write as soon as the war was on foot, with expectation it should prove a great one and most worthy the relation of all that had been before it
καὶ γὰρ πολιὰ τοῦ λέγοντος καὶ πλάσμα καὶ ὀφρῦς καὶ περιαυτολογία, μάλιστα δ’ αἱ κραυγαὶ καὶ οἱ θόρυβοι καὶ τὰ πηδήματα τῶν παρόντων συνεκπλήττει τὸν ἄπειρον ἀκροατὴν καὶ νέον ὥσπερ ὑπὸ ῥεύματος παραφερόμενον.	For example, a speaker’s grey hair, his formality, his serious brow, his self-assertion, and above all the clamour and shouting of the audience as he brings them to their feet, combine to disconcert the young and inexperienced listener, who is, as it were, swept away by the current.
πρὸς δὲ τούτοις καὶ ὑπῃδεῖτο αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ συσκηνίᾳ, ὥσπερ εἰκὸς πρεσβύτερον.	besides this he also treated Agesilaus with deference in their association together in their common quarters, as one would naturally treat an elder.
ἡ δὲ πληγὴ μᾶλλον ἐφόβησεν ἢ ἔβλαψε τὸν Εὐμενῆ, δι’ ἀσθένειαν ἀμυδρὰ γενομένη.	But the blow gave Eumenes more fright than harm, since lack of strength made it feeble.
Ἅβραμος δὲ κατῴκει μὲν περὶ τὴν Ὠγύγην καλουμένην δρῦν, ἔστι δὲ τῆς Χαναναίας τὸ χωρίον οὐ πόρρω τῆς Ἑβρωνίων πόλεως, δυσφορῶν δὲ ἐπὶ γυναικὶ μὴ κυούσῃ ἱκετεύει τὸν θεὸν γονὴν αὐτῷ παιδὸς ἄρσενος παρασχεῖν.	Now Abram dwelt near the oak called Ogyges,--the place belongs to Canaan, not far from the city of Hebron. But being uneasy at his wife's barrenness, he entreated God to grant that he might have male issue
ἐπεὶ δὲ πρῶτον ἐν τοῖς ἐλαχίστοις ἡ φύσις ἑκάστου θεωρεῖται, καὶ περὶ οἰκίας ἂν ὁμοίως ἔχοι. ὥστε καθ᾽ Ἡσίοδον δέοι ἂν ὑπάρχειν οἶκον μὲν πρώτιστα γυναῖκά τε [βοῦν τ᾽ ἀροτῆρα. ] ηες. ωδ 405 τὸ μὲν γὰρ τῆς τροφῆς πρῶτον, τὸ δὲ τῶν ἐλευθέρων.	and as households are no exception to the rule that the nature of a thing is first studied in its barest and simplest form, we will follow hesiod and begin by postulating " homestead first, and a woman; a plough - ox hardy to furrow." for the steading takes precedence among our physical necessities, and the woman among our free associates.
οὐ γὰρ οἶδ’ εἴ τινες ἀνθρώπων εὐγνωμονεστέροις ἐνέτυχον πολεμίοις οὐδ’ εἴ τινες ἀβλαβέστερον ἐπάλαισαν τοῖς μεγίστοις δοκοῦσιν εἶναι συμπτώμασι Μαντινέων διὰ τὴν Ἀράτου καὶ τῶν Ἀχαιῶν εἰς αὐτοὺς φιλαν θρωπίαν.	For I believe that there never were men who met with more kindly foes, or came out of a struggle with what seemed the most dreadful disasters more scatheless, than did the Mantineans, owing to the humanity of Aratus and the Achaeans towards them.
Ταῦθ' ἅμα λέγων εἰς δάκρυα τρέπεται λέγειν τε ἄπορος ἦν. καὶ Νικόλαος ὁ Δαμασκηνός, φίλος τε ὢν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τὰ πάντα συνδιαιτώμενος ἐκείνῳ καὶ τοῖς πράγμασιν ὃν πραχθεῖεν τρόπον παρατετευχώς, δεηθέντι τῷ βασιλεῖ τὰ λοιπὰ εἰπεῖν ὁπόσα ἀποδείξεών τε καὶ ἐλέγχων ἐχόμενα ἦν.	After saying this he broke down in tears and could say no more, but at his desire Nicolaus of Damascus, his friend and constant companion who knew all about his activities, went on at the king's request to explain all the proofs and evidences of the facts.
νῦν μὲν λέγω ἀγαθόν, νῦν δὲ κακόν.	I sometimes call a thing good, at other times bad.
ἐν πολυτρόποις γὰρ ξυμφοραῖς ἐπίστανται τραφέντες·	For you know that whilst they lived, they were obnoxious to manifold calamities.
ταῦτα κινεῖ, ταῦτ’ ἐξίστησιν ἀνθρώπους αὑτῶν, ἀήθεις ὄντας τοῦ προπηλακίζεσθαι.	These are the things that provoke men and make them beside themselves, if they are unused to insult.
εἶτα Ταπόσειρις οὐκ ἐπὶ θαλάττῃ, πανήγυριν δεχομένη μεγάλην·	then Taposeiris, not that situated upon the sea here is held a great public festival.
ὁμοίως διάκονοι ἄμεμπτοι κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ τῆς δικαιοσύνης ὡς θεοῦ καὶ Χριστοῦ διάκονοι καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώπων·	Likewise must the deacons be blameless before his righteousness, as the servants of God and Christ and not of man,
ἐγκωμιαζόντων δὲ τῶν Θρᾳκῶν αὐτὸν καὶ λεγόντων ὡς οὐδεὶς ἄλλος ἔσται τοιοῦτος, ἀγνοεῖτε εἶπεν ὦ ξένοι Βρασίδας μὲν γὰρ ἦν ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός, ἁ δὲ Λακεδαίμων πολλὼς ἔχει τήνω κάρρονας.	When the Thracians praised him, and affirmed that there would never be such another man, My friends, said she, you are mistaken Brasidas indeed was a valiant man, but Lacedaemon hath many more valiant men than he.
τί δ’, ὦ γεραιέ, διάβροχον τόδ’ ὄμμ’ ἔχεις;	Why are your eyes wet, old man?
καὶ οὐδὲ τοῦτο εἰκῇ πρᾶξαι κελεύει, ἀλλ’ ἀκριβῶς τὴν βουλὴν σκεψαμένην, ὅσοι αὐτῶν ἐπὶ Φυλῇ ἐπολιορκήθησαν ὅτε Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ τριάκοντα προσέβαλλον, οὐχ ὅσοι τὴν τάξιν ἔλιπον ἐν Χαιρωνείᾳ τῶν πολεμίων ἐπιόντων.	And not even this will he allow to be done carelessly, but only after careful examination by the Senate, to determine who of them actually stood siege at Phyle when the Lacedaemonians and the Thirty made their attack, not those who deserted their post—as at Chaeroneia—in the face of the advancing enemy.
ὅρα δὲ τὸν τέκτονα οὐ λέγεις, ὅταν μοιχεύοντά τινα γνῷς ἢ λιχνεύοντα ἴδῃς, οὐδὲ ὅρα τὸν μουσικόν.	But you do not say, Look at the carpenter, when you know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you see him to be a glutton nor do you say, See the musician.
ἐχόμενα τούτων θυμιατήρια δύο κίσσινα ἐκ χρυσοῦ ἑξαπήχη καὶ βωμὸς ἀνὰ μέσον τούτων τετράγωνος χρυσοῦ.	Next to them came two incense-burners made of ivy-wood, covered with gold, and six cubits in height, and a large square golden altar in the middle of them.
τὸ δὲ μαρτύριον Αἰσχύλος.	that have escaped the danger of cattle), of which Aeschylus is witness.
ὧδε δ’ ἔχοντι καὶ χρηματίζοντι πρὸ τῶν ἐμβόλων, τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν προλελεγμένων τιμῶν ἡ βουλή, τῶν ὑπάτων ἡγουμένων, ἐν κόσμῳ τῷ πρέποντι ἑκάστῳ προσέφερον.	To him in this state and while he was transacting business in front of the rostra, the Senate, preceded by the consuls, each one in his robes of office, brought the decree awarding him the honors aforesaid.
Ἡμεῖς δέ, ἀδελφοί, ἀπορφανισθέντες ἀφ' ὑμῶν πρὸς καιρὸν ὥρας, προσώπῳ οὐ καρδίᾳ, περισσοτέρως ἐσπουδάσαμεν τὸ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν ἰδεῖν ἐν πολλῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ·	But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire.
ἐπιτρέπουσιν, ἐν Ἤλιδι δὲ καὶ κρίσις γίνεται κάλλους, καὶ τῷ πρώτῳ τὰ τῆς θεοῦ φέρειν τεύχη δίδοται, τῷ δὲ δευτέρῳ τὸν βοῦν ἄγειν, ὁ δὲ τρίτος τὰς θυηλὰς ἐπιτίθησιν.	And at Elis there is a contest as to beauty, and the conqueror has the vessels of the goddess given to him to carry and the next handsomest has the ox to lead, and the third places the sacrificial cakes on the head of the victim.
Πολύβιος δ’ ὁ Μεγαλοπολίτης ἐν τετάρτῃ καὶ τριακοστῇ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν περὶ τῆς ἐν Ἰβηρίᾳ Λυσιτανίας χώρας διαλεγόμενός φησιν ὅτι βάλανοί εἰσι κατὰ βάθος ἐν τῇ αὐτόθι θαλάττῃ πεφυτευμέναι, ὧν τὸν καρπὸν σιτουμένους τοὺς θύννους πιαίνεσθαι. διόπερ οὐκ ἂν ἁμάρτοι τις λέγων ὗς εἶναι θαλαττίους τοὺς θύννους.	. . In the sea off Lusitania acorn-bearing oaks grow, upon which the tunnies feed and fatten themselves, which may, therefore, well be called sea-hogs, as they feed like hogs on acorns.
ποιεῖ οὖν Μωϋσῆς χαλκοῦν ὄφιν καὶ τίθησιν ἐνδόξως καὶ κηρύγματι καλεῖ τὸν λαόν.	Moses therefore makes a graven serpent, and places it in honour and calls the people by a proclamation.
Δημοσθένει δὲ ὄντι ἰδιώτῃ μετὰ τὴν ἀναχώρησιν τὴν ἐξ Ἀκαρνανίας αὐτῷ δεηθέντι εἶπον χρῆσθαι ταῖς ναυσὶ ταύταις, ἢν βούληται, περὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον.	To Demosthenes also, who ever since his return out of Acarnania had lived privately, they gave authority, at his own request, to make use of the same galleys, if he thought good so to do, about Peloponnesus.
καθαρὸς Ἀθήνας ἔλθ’ ὑπ’ οἰωνῶν καλῶν.	With clean hands seek Athens, attended by good omens.
τῷ δὲ τοῦτον μὲν τὸν τρόπον οὐκ οἰομένῳ διὰ τὸ τὰς ἐνούσας δυσχερείας ὁρᾶν περὶ τὰς ἰδέας ὥστε διά γε ταῦτα μὴ ποιεῖν ἀριθμούς, ποιοῦντι δὲ ἀριθμὸν τὸν μαθηματικόν, πόθεν τε χρὴ πιστεῦσαι ὡς ἔστι τοιοῦτος ἀριθμός, καὶ τί τοῖς ἄλλοις χρήσιμος;	But as for him who does not hold this belief, because he can see the difficulties inherent in the Ideal theory (and so has not this reason for positing numbers), and yet posits mathematical number, what grounds have we for believing his statement that there is a number of this kind, and what good is this number to other things?
ἡ δὴ γραφὴ περὶ τραύματος ὧδε ἡμῖν κείσθω· ἐάν τις διανοηθεὶς τῇ βουλήσει κτεῖναί τινα φίλιον, πλὴν ὧν ὁ νόμος ἐφίησιν, τρώσῃ μέν, ἀποκτεῖναι δὲ ἀδυνατήσῃ, τὸν διανοηθέντα τε καὶ τρώσαντα οὕτως οὐκ ἄξιον ἐλεεῖν, οὐδὲ αἰδούμενον ἄλλως ἢ καθάπερ ἀποκτείναντα ὑπέχειν τὴν δίκην φόνου ἀναγκάζειν·	So let our written law concerning wounding run thus—If any man purposing of intent to kill a friendly person—save such as the law sends him against,—wounds him, but is unable to kill him, he that has thus purposed and dealt the wound does not deserve to be pitied rather he is to be regarded exactly as a slayer, and must be compelled to submit to trial for murder
ἴθι νῦν, ἐπειδὴ τοῦ αὐτοῦ φαίνεται πολλούς τε καὶ ἕνα πείθειν, ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐμμελέτησον καὶ ἐπιχείρησον ἐπιδεῖξαι ὡς τὸ δίκαιον ἐνίοτε οὐ συμφέρει.	Come now, since we see that the same man may persuade either many or one, try your unpracticed hand on me, and endeavor to show that the just is sometimes not expedient.
καὶ τῶν μὲν πλεόνων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ αἱ γνῶμαι ἔφερον, ἀδικεῖν τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἤδη καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι ἐν τάχει·	The opinions of the majority all led to the same conclusion the Athenians were open aggressors, and war must be declared at once.
προσεθίζει γὰρ εἰς τὰ ἔργα τῷ αἰσχρῷ τὸ ῥᾳδίως ὑπὸ τῶν ῥημάτων ἄγεσθαι.	For, by enduring such base names, men are insensibly customed and drawn on to base actions.
ὅτι μὲν οὖν Πλαταιεὺς εἶναι πολλοῦ δεῖ, οἶμαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ τούτων σχεδόν τι γιγνώσκειν· ὅτι δὲ οὐδ’ αὐτὸς οὗτος, ὃς ἄριστα οἶδε τὰ αὑτοῦ, ἡγήσατο δόξαι ἂν ὑμῖν Πλαταιεὺς εἶναι, ἐξ ὧν ἔραξε ῥαδίως μαθήσεσθε.	Now, that he is far from being a Plataean, I think you perceive pretty clearly from these statements and that even the man himself, who is most fully aware of his own position, did not expect you to believe that he was a Plataean, will be readily impressed on you by his own conduct.
τοιοῦτον δέ τι συμβαίνει καὶ περὶ τὰς ἐν τοῖς χειμῶσιν ἐκβολάς·	A somewhat similar case is when cargo is jettisoned in a storm
ὅσοι μὲν οὖν ἕν τε τὸ πᾶν καὶ μίαν τινὰ φύσιν ὡς ὕλην τιθέασι, καὶ ταύτην σωματικὴν καὶ μέγεθος ἔχουσαν, δῆλον ὅτι πολλαχῶς ἁμαρτάνουσιν.	All those who regard the universe as a unity, and assume as its matter some one nature, and that corporeal and extended, are clearly mistaken in many respects.
καὶ πάντα τὰ κατὰ τὴν νῆσον θαυμάζων ἦλθεν καὶ εἰς τὸ Λητῷον, νομίζων τῆς Ἀπόλλωνος μητρὸς ἄγαλμα τι θεωρήσειν ἀξιόλογον·	till, by some chance, he came to Delos and as he was admiring everything he saw in the island, he came into the temple of Latona, expecting to see some very superb statue of the mother of Apollo
τοῦ δὲ παιδὸς προσκυνήσαντος ἐπί τε τοῖς λόγοις καὶ ταῖς δωρεαῖς, καλέσας τὸν Σιβὰν τὸν πατρῷον οἶκον ἔλεγε δεδωρῆσθαι τῷ παιδὶ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Σαούλου κτῆσιν, αὐτόν τε ἐκέλευσεν ἐργαζόμενον αὐτοῦ τὴν γῆν καὶ προνοούμενον ἁπάντων τὴν πρόσοδον εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα κομίζειν, ἄγειν τε αὐτὸν καθ’ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ἐπὶ τὴν αὐτοῦ τράπεζαν αὐτὸν Σιβὰν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἦσαν δ’ οὗτοι πεντεκαίδεκα, καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀριθμὸν ὄντας εἴκοσι τῷ παιδὶ χαρίζεται Μεμφιβόσθῳ.	And when the youth had worshipped him on account of his words and gifts given to him, he called for Ziba, and told him that he had given the youth his father's house, and all Saul's estate. He also ordered that Ziba should cultivate his land, and take care of it, and bring him the profits of all to Jerusalem. Accordingly, David brought him to his table every day, and bestowed upon the youth, Ziba and his sons, who were in number fifteen, and his servants, who were in number twenty.
ἐν τούτοις λείπει τὸ ὖ στοιχεῖον, ἐπεὶ πάντες οἱ ἀρχαῖοι τῷ οὖ ἀπεχρῶντο οὐ μόνον ἐφ’ ἧς νῦν τάττεται δυνάμεως, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅτε τὴν δίφθογγον διασημαίνει διὰ τοῦ οὖ μόνου γράφουσι.	But in this passage we want the final v which ought to have ended the word. Since all the ancients used the omicron not only with the power which it has now, but also when they meant to indicate the diphthong ει they wrote it by o only.
ὑμεῖς δέ, ὅπως διδῶσι δίκην οἱ ἀδικοῦντες, τούτου γε ἕνεκα καὶ δικασταὶ ἐγένεσθε καὶ ἐκλήθητε.	and it is in order that judgement may come upon wrongdoers for their misdeeds that you are yourselves constituted and called judges.
καί τινα μίαν νύκτα καὶ κατέδαρθον ἐν Θησείῳ τῷ ἐν πόλει ἐν ὅπλοις.	And one night they watched all night long in their arms in the temple of Theseus within the city.
οὐ μὴν ἀλλ’ Ἐπαμεινώνδας τὴν αὐτοῦ δόξαν ἐν ὑστέρῳ τῆς Πελοπίδου σωτηρίας τιθέμενος, καὶ δεδοικὼς μὴ τῶν πραγμάτων ταραχθέντων ἀπογνοὺς ἑαυτὸν Ἀλέξανδρος ὥσπερ θηρίον τράπηται πρὸς ἐκεῖνον, ἐπῃωρεῖτο τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ κύκλῳ περιϊὼν, τῇ παρασκευῇ καὶ τῇ μελλήσει κατεσκεύαζε καὶ συνέστελλε τὸν τύραννον, ὡς μήτε ἀντεῖναι τὸ αὔθαδες αὐτοῦ καὶ θρασυνόμενον μήτε τὸ πικρὸν καὶ θυμοειδὲς ἐξερεθίσαι,	Epaminondas, however, less solicitous for his own glory than for the safety of Pelopidas, and fearing that if confusion reigned Alexander would get desperate and turn like a wild beast upon his prisoner, dallied with the war, and taking a roundabout course, kept the tyrant in suspense by his preparations and threatened movements, thus neither encouraging his audacity and boldness, nor rousing his malignity and passion.
οὐ γὰρ ἐς ταὐτόν ποτε οὔτ’ εἶσιν οὔτε μητρὸς ὄψεται δέμας·	for never again will he meet me or see his mother
καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ὅτι συνηθροίσθησαν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Μασσηθάθ, καὶ ἀνέβησαν σατράπαι ἀλλοφύλων ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων.	And the Philistines heard that all the children of Israel had assembled at Mizpah, and leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. And the children of Israel heard and were terrified by the presence of the Philistines.
Αὕτη ἡ ἐπίσκεψις ἣν ἐπεσκέψαντο Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες Ἰσραήλ, δώδεκα ἄνδρες· ἀνὴρ εἷς κατὰ φυλὴν μίαν, κατὰ φυλὴν οἴκων πατριᾶς ἦσαν.	This is the census, which Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel carefully recorded, twelve men. They were one man from each tribe, according to the tribe of the ancestral households.
Ὁ δὲ Τίτος οὐδ' ἂν ἐπιβάντες ἐπ' αὐτοῦ πολεμῶσιν Ἰουδαῖοι φήσας ἀντὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἀμυνεῖσθαι τὰ ἄψυχα οὐδὲ καταφλέξειν ποτὲ τηλικοῦτον ἔργον:	But Titus said that even if the Jews got up on the sanctuary and fought from there, he wished to spare those lifeless things from the flames, rather than the men themselves.
δὲ Κάτων ’ὑπονοῶν τὴν μεταβολὴν οὐκ ἤλεγχε, τῷ μέντοι Σκηπίωνι καὶ τῷ Ἰόβᾳ γράψας ἀπέχεσθαι τῆς Ἰτύκης ἀπιστίᾳ Τῶν τριακοσίων ἐξέπεμψε τοὺς γραμματοφόρους. τῶν δὲ ἱππέων οἱ διαφυγόντες ἀπὸ τῆς μάχης, ἀριθμὸς οὐκ εὐκαταφρόνητος, προσελάσαντες τῇ Ἰτύκῃ πέμπουσι πρὸς τὸν Κάτωνα τρεῖς ἄνδρας οὐ τὴν αὐτὴν γνώμην ἀπὸ πάντων ἔχοντας.	Cato suspected their change of heart, but would not tax them with it. However, he wrote to Scipio and Juba advising them to keep away from Utica, because the three hundred were not to be trusted, and sent away the letter-bearers. And now the horsemen who had escaped from the battle, in numbers quite considerable, rode up to Utica and sent three of their number to Cato.
ἑπτὰ γὰρ ἄλλος οὐδεὶς καθῆκεν Ὀλυμπίασιν ἰδιώτης οὐδὲ βασιλεύς, μόνος δὲ ἐκεῖνος.	No one else ever entered seven of these at the Olympic games—neither commoner nor king—but he alone.
οὐκοῦν ἐν μὲν οἷς εἰσηγγελλόμην, ὅτ’ ἀπεψηφίζεσθέ μου καὶ τὸ μέρος τῶν ψήφων τοῖς διώκουσιν οὐ μετεδίδοτε, τότ’ ἐψηφίζεσθε τἄριστά με πράττειν·	When, on my impeachment, you acquitted me, and did not give the prosecutors the fifth part of your votes, your verdict implied approval of my policy.
χρωμένῳ δὲ τῷ Κύλωνι ἐν Δελφοῖς ἀνεῖλεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τοῦ Διὸς τῇ μεγίστῃ ἑορτῇ καταλαβεῖν τὴν Ἀθηναίων ἀκρόπολιν.	Now this Cylon was inquiring at Delphi when he was told by the god to seize the Acropolis of Athens on the grand festival of Zeus.
Ἀσπάζεται ὑμᾶς ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι συνεκλεκτὴ καὶ Μᾶρκος ὁ υἱός μου.¶	The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you, and so does Mark, my son.
οὔτε Θεόπομπος οὔτ’ Ἔφορος οὔτε Ξενοφῶν γέγραφεν, οὔτ’ εἰκὸς ἦν οὕτως ἐντρυφῆσαι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις μετὰ φυγὴν καὶ συμφορὰς τοσαύτας κατερχόμενον, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνος καὶ δεδιὼς κατήγετο, καὶ καταχθεὶς οὐ πρότερον ἀπέβη τῆς τριήρους, πρὶν στὰς ἐπὶ τοῦ καταστρώματος ἰδεῖν Εὐρυπτόλεμόν τε τὸν ἀνεψιὸν παρόντα καὶ τῶν ἄλλων φίλων καὶ οἰκείων συχνοὺς ἐκδεχομένους καὶ παρακαλοῦντας.	But neither Theopompus, nor Ephorus, nor Xenophon mentions these things, nor is it likely that Alcibiades put on such airs for the Athenians, to whom he was returning after he had suffered exile and many great adversities. Nay, he was in actual fear as he put into the harbor, and once in, he did not leave his trireme until, as he stood on deck, he caught sight of his cousin Euryptolemus on shore, with many other friends and kinsmen, and heard their cries of welcome.
ὅταν γοῦν εἰς τοῦτο ἐμποδίζειν ἡμῖν οἱ θεοὶ δοκῶσιν, κἀκείνους λοιδοροῦμεν καὶ τὰ ἱδρύματα αὐτῶν καταστρέφομεν καὶ τοὺς ναοὺς ἐμπιπρῶμεν, ὥσπερ Ἀλέξανδρος ἐκέλευσεν ἐμπρησθῆναι τὰ Ἀσκλήπεια ἀποθανόντος τοῦ ἐρωμένου.	When then the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this, we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn their temples, as Alexander ordered the temples of Aesculapius to be burned when his dear friend died.
ἵνα τί ὑπῆρξεν χρήματα ἄφρονι; κτήσασθαι γὰρ σοφίαν ἀκάρδιος· οὐ δυνήσεται. ὃς ὑψηλὸν ποιεῖ τὸν ἑαυτοῦ οἶκον ζητεῖ συντριβήν, ὁ δὲ σκολιάζων τοῦ μαθεῖν ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς κακά.	Why does wealth exist for a fool? For a foolish person is unable to acquire wisdom. One who makes his own house high is looking for ruin, and the one who turns aside from learning will fall into evil.
εὗρον ἡρπασμένον τὸν λύχνον.	I found my lamp was stolen.
Ἔστησε δ' Ἀψάλωμος ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῇ βασιλικῇ στήλην λίθου μαρμαρίνου δύο σταδίους ἀπέχουσαν Ἱεροσολύμων, ἣν προσηγόρευσεν ἰδίαν χεῖρα λέγων, ὡς καὶ τῶν τέκνων αὐτοῦ διαφθαρέντων ἐν τῇ στήλῃ μενεῖ τὸ ὄνομα:	Absalom had erected for himself a marble pillar in the Valley of Kings, two furlongs from Jerusalem, which he named Absalom's Hand, saying that even if his children were killed, his name would remain on that pillar
καὶ ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὸν νυμφῶνα, λήμψῃ τέφραν θυμιαμάτων καὶ ἐπιθήσεις ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας καὶ τοῦ ἥπατος τοῦ ἰχθύος· καὶ καπνίσεις,	And when you enter into the bride’s chamber, you will take coals of incense and place upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish and burn them into smoke.
ἀποβὰς οὖν μετ’ ὀλίγων ἐνέτυχε παίζουσι παιδαρίοις παρὰ τὴν θάλατταν·	Therefore, going on shore a little after, he happened to meet with some children playing by the seaside
ὥστε τί χρὴ τῷ λόγῳ παρακαλεῖν ἐς προθυμίαν τε καὶ ὁμόνοιαν, οὓς ἥ τε παρασκευὴ καὶ τὰ ἔργα κοινὰ ὄντα συνάγει;	Why is it needful, then, to exhort you with words to zeal and unanimity -- you whom a common purpose and common interests have brought together?
Δικαίαρχος δἐ ὁρίζει τὴν γῆν οὐχ ὕδασιν, ἀλλὰ τομῇ εὐθείᾳ ἀκράτῳ, ἀπὸ στηλῶν διὰ Σαρδοῦς, Σικελίας, Πελοποννήσου, Ἰωνίας, Καρίας, Λυκίας, Παμφυλίας, Κιλικίας καὶ Ταύρου Ταύρου, ἑξῆς ἕως Ἰμάου ὄρους. Τῶν τοίνυν τόπων τὸ μὲν Βόρειον, τὸ δὲ Νότιον ὀνομάζει.	Dicaearchus bounds the earth not by waters but by a straight line from the Pillars through Sardinia Sicily Peloponnesus Ionia Caria Lycia Pamphylia Cilicia and Taurus on to Mt Imaus, and he calls the several regions either northern or southern.
αἱ μὲν οὖν Μυκῆναι νῦν οὐκέτ’ εἰσίν, ἔκτισε δ’ αὐτὰς Περσεύς, διεδέξατο δὲ Σθένελος, εἶτ’ Εὐρυσθεύς·	Mycen exists no longer. It was founded by Perseus. Sthenelus succeeded Perseus and Eurystheus, Sthenelus.
αὐτός μοι εἰπέ, ἐπειδὴ ἐγὼ οὐχ εὑρίσκω.	Tell me yourself, for I cannot discover them.
ἀλλὰ καὶ ζωμὸς ἡδύς ἐστι καὶ γυνὴ καλὴ ἡδύ ἐστιν.	but a soup is pleasant, and a handsome woman is pleasant.
κἀκεῖν’ εὖ οἶδ’ ὅτι τὴν ἐμὴν δεινότητα ἔστω γάρ.	I am also sure that my artfulness—well, be it so
Ὁ δὲ Ἀράβιος κόλπος, στενὸς ὢν καὶ προμήκης, ἄρχεται ἀπὸ Ἡρώων πόλεως, παρὰ τὴν Τρωγλοδυτικὴν ἕως τῆς Πτολεμαΐδος τῆς ἐπὶ θήρας, σταδίων ͵θ τὸ μῆκος· ἐντεῦθεν δὲ ἕως τῶν κατὰ Δειρὴν στενῶν πλοῦς σταδίων ͵δψʹ· τὰ δὲ κατὰ Δειρὴν στενὰ σταδίων ξʹ· ἔνθεν ἑξῆς πλοῦς παρὰ τὴν Ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν ἕως ὠκεανοῦ σταδίων ͵ε·	The Arabian Gulf, being narrow and oblong, begins from the gulf of Heroöpolis along Troglodytica to Ptolemais at the Hunts 9000 stades long, where follows a voyage of 6500 stades, the narrows at Deire of 60 stades, along the Red Sea to the ocean 5000 stades, the rest is not navigated.
Φουρνίου δ’ ἄλλον στρατὸν ἄγοντος τῷ Λευκίῳ, ὁ Καῖσαρ ἐξήπτετο τῆς οὐραγίας·	While Furnius was bringing a reënforcement to Lucius, Octavius fell upon his rear guard.
μόλις οὖν ἀνευρόντες ὅτι τοὔνομα τοῦτ’ ἦν τῇ ῥαπισθείσῃ παιδί, μεμιγμένην τινὰ καθαρμῷ θυσίαν ἀπετέλεσαν, ἣν ἐπιτελοῦσιν ἔτι καὶ νῦν δι’ ἐννέα ἐτῶν.	Accordingly, when they had discovered with some difficulty that this was the name of the child who had been struck, they performed a certain sacrificial rite combined with purification, which even now they continue to perform every eight years.
ἐντεῦθεν ἐς Ἀκραίφνιόν ἐστιν ὁδὸς τὰ πλείω πεδιάς.	From this point to Acraephnium is mainly flat.
ἐγὼ δ’ οὐδὲν τούτων ἄλογον οἶμαι ποιεῖν.	I, however, do not see anything unreasonable in this.
φόβος οὖν ἔστιν, ἐὰν μὴ κόσμιοι ὦμεν πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, ὅπως μὴ καὶ αὖθις διασχισθησόμεθα, καὶ περίιμεν ἔχοντες ὥσπερ οἱ ἐν ταῖς στήλαις καταγραφὴν ἐκτετυπωμένοι, διαπεπρισμένοι κατὰ τὰς ῥῖνας, γεγονότες ὥσπερ λίσπαι.	and we may well be afraid that if we are disorderly towards Heaven we may once more be cloven asunder and may go about in the shape of those outline-carvings on the tombs, with our noses sawn down the middle, and may thus become like tokens of split dice.
ἐγὼ γὰρ ὅτε μὲν ἱππικῇ τὸν νοῦν μόνῃ προσεῖχον, οὐδ’ ἂν τρί’ εἰπεῖν ῥήμαθ’ οἷός τ’ ἦν πρὶν ἐξαμαρτεῖν·	For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship alone, used not to be able to utter three words before I made a mistake
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἴσον ἐστὶν ἢ μὴ καλῶς ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ χυλωθῆναι τὴν τροφὴν ἢ μὴ χρηστὸν αἷμα γεννηθῆναι.	For it is not equally important whether the aliment be imperfectly chylified in the stomach or whether it fail to be turned into useful blood.
Εὔθυνος δ’ ἔχων σανδάλια καὶ σφραγῖδα καὶ μεμυρισμένος ἐλογίζετο τῶν πραγμάτων οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅ τι·	— Euthymus too was there, with sandals on, A ring upon his finger, well perfumed, Silently pondering on I know not what.
τοιούτων δὲ ὄντων Θηραμένης εἶπεν ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ ὅτι εἰ βούλονται αὐτὸν πέμψαι παρὰ Λύσανδρον, εἰδὼς ἥξει Λακεδαιμονίους πότερον ἐξανδραποδίσασθαι τὴν πόλιν βουλόμενοι ἀντέχουσι περὶ τῶν τειχῶν ἢ πίστεως ἕνεκα.	This being the condition of affairs in Athens, Theramenes said in the Assembly that if they were willing to send him to Lysander, he would find out before he came back whether the Lacedaemonians were insistent in the matter of the walls because they wished to reduce the city to slavery, or in order to obtain a guarantee of good faith.
καὶ οὗτοι ἐξελέξαντο τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν, ἃ ἡ ψυχὴ ’ἠθέλησε, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐκλέξομαι τὰ ἐμπαίγματα ‟αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἀνταποδώσω αὐτοῖς. ’ οὗτος δὲ τῇ βασιλείᾳ παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἐπιμανεὶς, καὶ τὸν βασίλειον ὑποδῦναι κόσμον ἀδυνατῶν ἀναπήρῳ τῷ σώματι, τοὺς δύο παῖδας τὰς πατρῴας ἀναδεξαμένους ἁμαρτίας προεστήσατο.	“Αnd these have Chosen their own ways and abominations, in which their soul delighteth, and I will their mockings, and their sins I will recompense them.᾿ now this man,3 in his mad desire for imperial rule of Which he was not worthy, and unable to deck his maimed body With the imperial robes, put forward his two sons, who thus received their father's sins.
ἀποψυχθέντα γὰρ, εἰς πωρωειδέα λίθον πήγνυται.	for when congealed, the water gets concreted into a sort of chalk-stones.
οὕτως αἰεί τι μύσος ἑκάστου ἔτους ἐπὶ τῆς ἀγορᾶς ἐγίγνετο·	Thus every year some new deed of abomination was committed in the forum.
ὅρκους δ᾽ ἐκεῖ καὶ πίστιν ἀλλήλοις δότε.	there at table you will pledge good behaviour and uprightness
μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα εἰσῆλθον κέρασί τε οἵοις σημαίνουσιν αὐλοῦντες καὶ σάλπιγξιν ὠμοβοείαις ῥυθμούς τε καὶ οἱονεὶ μάγαδιν σαλπίζοντες.	And after this there came in men who played on horns such as are used for giving orders with, and also on trumpets made of raw bull's-hide, in excellent tune, as if they had been playing on a magadis.
Ὁ δὲ τῶν Ἀντιοχέων δῆμος ἐπεὶ πλησίον ὄντα Τίτον ἐπυνθάνοντο, μένειν μὲν ἐντὸς τειχῶν ὑπὸ χαρᾶς οὐχ ὑπέμενον, ἔσπευδον δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν ὑπάντησιν:	When the people of Antioch were told that Titus was near they were so glad that they could not stay within their walls, but hurried out to meet him,
καὶ υἱὸς Σεχενιά· Σαμαιά. καὶ υἱὸς Σαμαιά· Χαττούς, καὶ Ἰωὴλ καὶ Μαρεὶ καὶ Νωαδειὰ καὶ Σαφάθ, ἕξ.	The son of Shecaniah: Shemaiah. And the son of Shemaiah: Hattush and Igal and Bariah and Neariah and Shaphat, six in all.
ὅσοι δ’ ἦσαν ἀπὸ τῆς βουλῆς ἢ ἄλλως ἐπιφανεῖς, μονομαχεῖν αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ θεαταῖς τοῖς Λίβυσιν ἠνάγκασε, πατέρας τε υἱοῖς καὶ ἀδελφοὺς ἀδελφοῖς, οὐδὲν ἐκλείπων ὑπεροψίας ὠμῆς.	The senators and other distinguished prisoners in his hands he compelled to fight with each other, as a spectacle for the Africans, fathers against sons, and brothers against brothers. He omitted no act of disdainful cruelty.
ὁ μέντοι πατὴρ οὐδ’ ἐντροπῆς ἄξιος ἔοικεν φαίνεσθαι τοῦ περὶ ἐκείνους ἀσεβήματος, ὃς οὔτε πίστιν ἐπιβουλῆς ἐναργῆ λαβὼν οὔτε παρασκευὴν ἐπιχειρήσεως ἐλέγχειν ἔχων ἐτόλμησεν ἀποκτεῖναι τοὺς ἐξ αὐτοῦ φύντας, ἀρίστους μὲν τὰ σώματα καὶ περιποθήτους πᾶσιν τοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, οὐκ ἀποδέοντας δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν, εἴ που θηρᾶν ἢ γυμνάζεσθαι τὰ πολέμων ἢ λέγειν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐμπεσόντων ἔδει.	yet cannot their father be thought worthy excuse, as to that horrid impiety which he was guilty of about them, while he ventured, without any certain evidence of their treacherous designs against him, and without any proofs that they had made preparations for such attempt, to kill his own sons, who were of very comely bodies, and the great darlings of other men, and no way deficient in their conduct, whether it were in hunting, or in warlike exercises, or in speaking upon occasional topics of discourse
ἵνα μή τις εἴπῃ ὅτι εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα ἐβαπτίσθητε. Καὶ ταύτῃ τῇ πεποιθήσει ἐβουλόμην πρότερον πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν, ἵνα δευτέραν χάριν σχῆτε	so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name!
Ἡδύλη δ’ ἡ τοῦ ποιητοῦ τούτου μήτηρ, Μοσχίνης δὲ θυγάτηρ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἰάμβων ποιητρίας, ἐν τῇ ἐπιγραφομένῃ Σκύλλῃ ἱστορεῖ τὸν Γλαῦκον ἐρασθέντα Σκύλλης ἐλθεῖν αὐτῆς εἰς τὸ ἄντρον ‘ἢ κόγχου δωρήματα’ φέροντα Ἐρυθραίης ἀπὸ πέτρης, ἢ τοὺς ἀλκυόνων παῖδας ἔτ’ ἀπτερύγους, τῇ νύμφῃ δύσπιστος ἀθύρματα.	But Hedyl, the mother of this poet, and daughter of Moschine of Atica, a poetess who composed Iambics, in her poem which is entitled Scylla, relates that Glaucus being in love with Scylla came to her cave— Bearing a gift of love, a mazy shell, Fresh from the Erythrean rock, and with it too The offspring, yet unfledged, of Alcyon, To win th' obdurate maid. He gave in vain.
τὸν οὖν Πύθιον, εἰ δὴ μουσικῇ θ’ ἣδεται καὶ κύκνων φωναῖς καὶ κιθάρας ψόφοις, τί θαυμαστόν ἐστι διαλεκτικῆς φιλίᾳ τοῦτ’ ἀσπάζεσθαι τοῦ λόγου τὸ μέρος καὶ ἀγαπᾶν, ᾧ μάλιστα καὶ πλείστῳ προσχρωμένους ὁρᾷ τοὺς φιλοσόφους;	If then the Pythian Apollo delights in music, and is pleased with the singing of swans and the harmony of the lute, what wonder is it that, for the sake of logic, he embraces and loves this argumentative particle, which he sees the philosophers so much and so frequently to use?
ἕτερον δὲ τὸ περὶ τῆς κατὰ τὴν ξανθὴν χολὴν διακρίσεως.	Another is that which they make about the secretion of yellow bile.
τοῖς δ’ ἔργοις ἄν τις τεκμήραιτο μάλιστα ὅτι Ἀπολλόδωρος πέπονθεν ὃ ἀντευποιεῖν ἠξίου τοὺς ἑαυτὸν εὐεργετήσαντας.	The acts of Apollodorus supply the best evidence that he has received kind treatment for which he thought fit to make return to his benefactors.
ἐπεκαλεῖτο δ’ ὁ Λυκοῦργος ἶβις ἶβις Λυκούργῳ, Χαιρεφῶντι νυκτερὶς κατῆγον δὲ τὸ γένος ἀπὸ τούτων καὶ Ἐρεχθέως τοῦ Γῆς καὶ Ἡφαίστου·	He was called the Ibis The ibis to Lycurgus, to Chaerephon the bat. His ancestors derived their pedigree from Erechtheus, the son of the Earth and of Vulcan
Γάιον δ' ἱστορεῖται παρὰ φύσιν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ εὐπροσηγορώτατον γενέσθαι κατ' ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ δεξιότητι χρώμενον ὁμιλίας πάνθ' ὁντινοῦν ἐκπλῆξαι τῶν παρατυγχανόντων.	It is also reported that on that day, contrary to his usual custom, Gaius was so very affable and good-natured in conversation, that all of those present were astonished at it.
συμφήσομεν ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι σοι ἴσως ταῦτ’, ὦ ξένε, τῇ μετὰ σοῦ κατὰ χρόνον ἂν γενομένῃ, δοξάσαι περὶ αὐτῶν εἰς αὖθις τὸ ἀληθέστατον.	We shall probably agree with you on that, my good sir, in the hope which in time you will surely give us of forming hereafter the truest opinion on these matters.
σκέψαι δὴ ἐκ ταύτης τῆς ἀπορίας ὅτι καὶ ἀνευρήσει ζητῶν μετ’ ἐμοῦ, οὐδὲν ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐρωτῶντος ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐ διδάσκοντος·	Now you should note how, as a result of this perplexity, he will go on and discover something by joint inquiry with me, while I merely ask questions and do not teach him
ὅμως δὲ τοῦ τε παρόντος κακοῦ τὸ μέγεθος ἐδίδασκεν ἀνδρίαν τινὰ καὶ πέρα τοῦ δυνατοῦ γίνεσθαι καὶ ἅμα τὰ ἀμείνω παρίστατο αὐτοῖς ἐλπίζειν· οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἄνευ θεοῦ διὰ τοσούτου σφίσιν ὑπάρξαι τὴν ἐς Πελοπόννησον κάθοδον.	Nevertheless the magnitude of the present evil caused them to display a courage beyond their strength, also they were inspired with hope for the best, since it seemed not without divine help that they had accomplished their return to Peloponnese after so long an absence.
ἡ δ’ ἔφοδος αὐτῶν ἀπὸ θερινῶν τροπῶν μέχρι μέσου χειμῶνος.	The time of their incursion is from the summer solstice to the middle of winter.
ὄνομα δὲ τούτῳ ἐστίν, ὡς οἱ ποιηταὶ λέγουσιν, κωκυτός.	And the name of this river, as the Poets say, is Cocytus.
εἰ δέ τινα ἄλλην ἡδονὴν παρέχεται, θαυμαστὸν οὐδέν. ἢ πῶς σοι φαίνεται;	But if from another point of view they yield some pleasure we must not be surprised, or what is your view of it?
Δάτις ὁ Περσῶν σατράπης μετὰ τριάκοντα μυριάδων εἰς Μαραθῶνα παραγενόμενος, πεδίον τῆς Ἀττικῆς, καὶ στρατοπεδευσάμενος πόλεμον τοῖς ἐγχωρίοις κατήγγειλεν Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τοῦ βαρβαρικοῦ πλήθους καταφρονήσαντες ἐννακισχιλίους ἔπεμψαν, στρατηγοὺς; ποιήσαντες Κυνέγειρον Πολύζηλον Καλλίμαχον Μιλτιάδην.	Datis, an eminent Persian commander, drew out three hundred thousand men to Marathon, a plain of Attica, where he encamped and declared war against the inhabitants. The Athenians made no reckoning at all of so barbarous a rabble, but sent out nine thousand men against him, under the command of Cynaegirus, Polyzelus, Callimachus, and Miltiades.
ἀλλ’ ἦ πρόθυμον οὖσαν οὐκ ἐᾷ θεὸς ξένοις ἀρήγειν τήνδε χρῄζουσιν πόλιν;	Can it be that heaven forbids this city to help strangers, when it hath the will and longing so to do?
Κορίνθιοι δὲ ἀπὸ Μακεδόνων ἐλευθερωθέντες μετέσχον αὐτίκα συνεδρίου τοῦ Ἀχαιῶν, μετασχόντες καὶ πρότερον, ὅτε Ἄρατος καὶ Σικυώνιοι φρουρὰν ἐκ τοῦ Ἀκροκορίνθου τὴν πᾶσαν ἐξήλασαν καὶ ἀπέκτειναν Περσαῖον ὑπὸ Ἀντιγόνου ταχθέντα ἐπὶ τῇ φρουρᾷ.	On being delivered from the Macedonians the Corinthians at once joined the Achaean League they had joined it on a previous occasion, when the Sicyonians under Aratus drove all the garrison out of Acrocorinth, killing Persaeus, who had been placed in command of the garrison by Antigonus.
καὶ τούτων οἵ τε ἄλλοι πάντες ἔφερον ὅτι τις ἐδύνατο ἕκαστος χρήσιμον, καὶ οἱ ὁπλῖται καὶ οἱ ἱππῆς παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς αὐτοὶ τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν σιτία ὑπὸ τοῖς ὅπλοις, οἱ μὲν ἀπορίᾳ ἀκολούθων, οἱ δὲ ἀπιστίᾳ·	All carried anything they could which might be of use, and the heavy infantry and troopers, contrary to their wont, while under arms carried their own victuals, in some cases for want of servants, in others through not trusting them
Περὶ Κλήμεντος τοῦ Ἀλεξανδρέως.	On Clement the Alexandrian.
ὅτι φωνὴ οἰκτροῦ ἠκούσθη ἐν Σειών Πῶς ἐταλαιπωρήσαμεν, κατῃσχύνθημεν σφόδρα, ὅτι ἐνκατελίπομεν τὴν γῆν καὶ ἀπερίψαμεν τὰ σκηνώματα ἡμῶν.	Because the sound of a lamentable person was heard in Zion: ‘How have we endured hardship! We have been exceedingly disgraced, because we have forsaken the land, and we have cast down our tents.’ ”
οὐκ ἐᾷ εὔχεσθαι ὑπὲρ ἑαυτῶν διὰ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι τὸ συμφέρον.	He forbids us to pray for ourselves, because we do not know what will help us.
Καὶ εἰπόντος αὐτοὶ ἕως ἔξω τῶν πυλῶν·	And they went after him until he had brought them without the gate.
τὸ δὲ Σουνίῳ καὶ Σκυλλαίῳ περιεχόμενον πέλαγος Σαρωνικόν, εἶτα Μυρτῶον καὶ Ἰκάριον ἐν ᾧ αἱ Κυκλάδες, εἶτα Καρπάθιον καὶ Παμφύλιον καὶ Αἰγύπτιον.	The Saronic sea enclosed by Sunium and Scyllaeum, then the Myrtoan and Icarian, in which are the Cyclades, then the Carpathian and Pamphylian and Egyptian.
πᾶν ὑψηλὸν ὁρᾷ, αὐτὸς δὲ βασιλεὺς πάντων τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὕδασιν.	It sees everything that is high, and it itself is king of all that is in the waters.”
ὦ τλάμων ἅγησαί μοι πούς, ἅγησαι τᾷ γηραιᾷ πρὸς τάνδ’ αὐλάν·	Oh! luckless steps, lead on, guide your aged mistress here to the tent.
οἷς ἐντυχοῦσα ἢ ὑμετέρα στερρότης δοκιμάσει ὅντινα χρὴ τρόπον τὴν προειρημένην δίκην ἐπιμελέστατα διευκρινῆσαι καὶ κατὰ τὸ δίκαιον τερματίσαι, ὁπότε μηδὲ τὴν ὑμετέραν ἐπιμέλειαν λανθάνει τοσαύτην με αἰδῶ τῇ ἐνθέαμῳ καθολικῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀπονέμειν, ὡς μηδὲν καθόλου σχίσμα ἢ διχοστασίαν ἔν τινι τόπῳ βούλεσθαί με ὑμᾶς καταλιπεῖν.	Which when your Firmness reads, he will gauge by what method the most eareful investigation can be made of the above-mentioned suit, and a just deeision arrived at since it does not escape the notice of your Carefulness that the respect which I pay to the lawful Catholic Church is so great, that it is my wish that ye should leave no schism whatsoever or division in any plaee.
ξύνεστι μὲν αὐτέοισι, ἀθρόον μὲν εἰρῆσθαι, ἅπασι πόνος καὶ ἔντασις τενόντων καὶ Ῥάχεος, καὶ μυῶν τῶν ἐν γνάθοισι καὶ θώρηκι, ἐρείδουσι γὰρ τὴν κάτω γένυν πρὸς τὴν ἄνω, ὡς μηδὲ μοχλοῖσιν ἢ σφηνὶ διὰ Ῥηϊδίως στῆσαι δύνασθα ι.	In all these varieties, then, to speak generally, there is a pain and tension of the tendons and spine, and of the muscles connected with the jaws and cheek for they fasten the lower jaw to the upper, so that it could not easily be separated even with levers or a wedge.
εἷλον δ’ οὖν οἱ ἡγεμόνες τῶν Βαβυλωνίων, οἷς ἐπίστευσε τὴν πολιορκίαν ὁ Ναβουχοδονόσορος· αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐν Ἀραβαθᾶ διέτριβε πόλει.	They were indeed only generals of the king of Babylon, to whom Nebuchadnezzar committed the care of the siege, for he abode himself in the city of Riblah.
Χαράδρα δὲ εἴκοσιν ἀπωτέρω σταδίοις ἐστὶν ὑπὲρ ὑψηλοῦ κειμένη κρημνοῦ, καὶ ὕδατος οἱ ἐνταῦθα σπανίζουσιν ἄνθρωποι, ποτὸν δέ σφισι ποταμός ἐστι Χάραδρος κατερχομένοις ὅσον τρία ἐπ’ αὐτὸν στάδια·	Charadra is twenty stades distant, situated on the top of a lofty crag. The inhabitants are badly off for water their drinking water is the river Charadrus, and they have to go down about three stades to reach it.
Ἀντίοχος δὲ περὶ τῆσδε τῆς ναυμαχίας πυθόμενος, Ἀννίβαν ἔστελλεν ἐπὶ Συρίας ἐς νεῶν ἄλλων ἐκ τε Φοινίκης καὶ Κιλικίας παρασκευήν.	When Antiochus received the news of this naval fight, he sent Hannibal to Syria to fit out another fleet from Phœnicia and Cilicia.
ὁ τῆς προσκαίρου φαντασίας ῥυσάμενός με καὶ εἰς τὴν ἀεὶ μένουσαν ὁδηγήσας με·	who didst save me from the temporal fantasy and lead me unto that which endureth always
πιθανώτατα ἐν τούτοις ὁ Ἀντιφάνης καὶ τὸν Μισγόλαν κεκωμῴδηκεν ὡς ἐσπουδακότα περὶ κιθαρῳδοὺς ὡραίους.	And it is a very clever way in which Antiphanes thus jested upon Misgolas, as devoting all his attention to beautiful harp-players and lyre-players
καὶ καθαλόμενοί τινες ἀνέῳξαν τῷ Σκιπίωνι τὰς πύλας· ὁ δ’ ἐσεπήδησε μετὰ τῆς στρατιᾶς δρόμῳ.	Some of the Romans jumped down and opened the gates to Scipio, who rushed in with his army.
ἐπεὶ μέντοι οὕτως ἤρου, ταῦτ’, ἔφη, χρὴ ποιεῖν ὅσα ὁ θεὸς ἐκέλευσεν.	However, he added, since you did put the question in that way, you must do all that the god directed.
λαμπροτάτην γὰρ δὴ σπουδὴν ἐς τοὺς ἀτυχοῦντας ὁ Πομπήιος ἐν καιρῷ τότε ἔδειξε, κήρυκάς τε περιπέμπων, οἳ πάντας ἐς αὐτὸν ἐκάλουν, καὶ τοῖς περισῴζουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐλευθέροις τε καὶ θεράπουσι προλέγων διπλάσια τῶν διδομένων τοῖς αἱροῦσι·	The latter showed the most admirable zeal in behalf of the unfortunate at this crisis, sending heralds who invited all to come to him, and offered to those who should save the proscribed, both slaves and free persons, double the rewards that had been offered for killing them.
δεσμὸς δὲ καὶ τὸ γῆρας αἵ τε νήστιδες δύαι διδάσκειν ἐξοχώταται φρενῶν ἰατρομάντεις.	But chains and old age and the pangs of fasting Stand out before all else in teaching, — prophets At souls’-cure!
οἷος δορυσσοῦς Ἀμφιάρεως, τὰ πρῶτα μὲν δόρει κρατύνων, πρῶτα δ’ οἰωνῶν ὁδοῖς·	One such is swift-speared Amphiaraus, a matchless warrior, and a matchless diviner
ταῦτ’ ἔχοντες τὰ δίκαια εἰσεληλύθαμεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἀξιοῦντες τὰ ἡμέτερα αὐτῶν ἀπολαβεῖν δι’ ὑμῶν, ἐπειδὴ παρ’ αὐτῶν τούτων οὐ δυνάμεθα.	These are the just claims with which we have come before you demanding to recover our money through your help, since we cannot get it from these men themselves.
εἶχεν γὰρ τὴν κατοίκησιν αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν πολιτείαν γεγραμμένην.	for he had all their habitations and polity down in writing."
τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς ἐπλάτυνεν ἐφ᾽ ὕδατα ἐρήμου, ἐν ἐπιθυμίαις ψυχῆς αὐτῆς ἐπνευματοφορεῖτο, παρεδόθη. τίς ἐπιστρέψει αὐτήν; πάντες οἱ ζητοῦντες αὐτὴν οὐ κοπιάσουσιν, ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτῆς εὑρήσουσιν αὐτήν.	she has spread her ways over the waters of the desert; in the lust of her soul she was borne by the wind; she was handed over. Who will return her? All who seek her will not grow weary; in her humiliation they will find her.
ἐκ δὲ τούτου προϊοῦσα καὶ νεμομένη κατὰ μικρὸν ἡ περὶ τὸ μειράκιον ἄνεσις τοὺς ἀδαμαντίνους δεσμοὺς ἐκείνους, οἷς ὁ πρεσβύτερος Διονύσιος ἔφη δεδεμένην ἀπολείπειν τὴν μοναρχίαν, ἐξέτηξε καὶ διέφθειρεν.	As a consequence, the laxity of the young king gained ground little by little, until at last those adamantine bonds with which the elder Dionysius said he had left the monarchy fastened, were melted and destroyed.
ἐκπεσὼν δὲ τῆς Βοιωτίας ἐπυνθάνετο τοῦ θεοῦ ποῦ κατοικήσει· χρησθέντος δὲ αὐτῷ κατοικεῖν ἐν ᾧπερ ἂν τόπῳ ὑπὸ ζῴων ἀγρίων ξενισθῇ, πολλὴν χώραν διελθὼν ἐνέτυχε λύκοις προβάτων μοίρας νεμομένοις·	Being banished from Boeotia, Athamas inquired of the god where he should dwell, and on receiving an oracle that he should dwell in whatever place he should be entertained by wild beasts, he traversed a great extent of country till he fell in with wolves that were devouring pieces of sheep
κατὰ λόγον γέ τοι ἄν, ἔφη, οὕτω γίγνοιτο ἥ τε θέα καὶ ἡ κρίσις.	That would be at least a systematic and consistent way of conducting the observation and the decision, he said.
ὁ δὲ Γράκχος καὶ ὁδοὺς ἔτεμνεν ἀνὰ τὴν Ἰταλίαν μακράς, πλῆθος ἐργολάβων καὶ χειροτεχνῶν ὑφ’ ἑαυτῷ ποιούμενος, ἑτοίμων ἐς ὅ τι κελεύοι, καὶ ἀποικίας ἐσηγεῖτο πολλάς.	Gracchus made long roads throughout Italy and thus put a multitude of contractors and artisans under obligations to him and made them ready to do whatever he wished. He proposed the founding of numerous colonies.
ὡς δὲ ἤχθη, μεταπεμψάμενος τὸν ἄνθρωπον, οὐ λέληθας, ἔφη, παρὰ τὸν νόμον ἀπονυκτερεύων ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ χρηστὸς ὢν πρότερον ἐλελήθεις·	When she came, he sent for the soldier and told him It is known you lie out a nights, contrary to the law
” γελάσας δ’ ὁ Πτολεμαῖος συνεχώρησεν αὐτῷ δίχα τῶν ὁμολογούντων ἔχειν τὰ τέλη.	So Ptolemy laughed at the proposal, and granted him the farming of the taxes without any sureties.
εἰ μή τις οἴεται πρὸς διαγωγὴν ζῆν τοὺς οὔρῳ λουομένους ἐν δεξαμεναῖς παλαιουμένῳ, καὶ τοὺς ὀδόντας σμηχομένους καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν, καθάπερ τοὺς Καντάβρους φασὶ καὶ τοὺς ὁμόρους αὐτοῖς.	They do not attend to ease or luxury, unless any one considers it can add to the happiness of their lives to wash themselves and their wives in stale urine kept in tanks, and to rinse their teeth with it, which they say is the custom both with the Cantabrians and their neighbours.
σωτηρίων δὲ πραγμάτων εὐάγγελον ἥκοντα πρὸς χαίρουσαν εὐεστοῖ πόλιν, πῶς κεδνὰ τοῖς κακοῖσι συμμείξω, λέγων χειμῶν᾽ Ἀχαιοῖς οὐκ ἀμήνιτον θεῶν;	how shall i mix good things with evil, telling of storm against the achaioi, urged by gods' wrath?
πρὶν δ’ ὅλον καταδῦναι τὸ σῶμα δελφίνων ὑποδραμόντων ἀναφέροιτο, μεστὸς ὢν ἀπορίας καὶ ἀγωνίας καὶ ταραχῆς τὸ πρῶτον·	but before his body sunk he found himself supported by dolphins. At first he was surprised with care and trouble
ἐνίοτε δὲ καὶ ξυλιζόμενοι ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ χόρτον καὶ ἄλλα τοιαῦτα ξυλλέγοντες πληγὰς ἐνέτεινον ἀλλήλοις· ὥστε καὶ τοῦτο ἔχθραν παρεῖχε.	Sometimes, moreover, when Greeks and barbarians were getting firewood from the same place or collecting fodder or other such things, they would come to blows with one another, and this also occasioned ill-will.
σχεδὸν δὲ καὶ περὶ τὰς ὀλιγαρχίας πῶς δεῖ φανερὸν ἐκ τούτων.	It is also fairly clear from these considerations how oligarchies ought to be organized.
ὁ γοῦν Σκιπίων ἤκουσεν ἐν Ῥώμῃ κακῶς, ὅτι φίλους ἑστιῶν ἐπὶ τῇ καθιερώσει τοῦ Ἡρακλείου τὸν συνάρχοντα Μόμμιον οὐ παρέλαβε·	Scipio therefore was ill spoken of in Rome, for that, making a feast for his friends at the dedication of a temple to Hercules, he invited not to it his colleague Mummius
ταῦτα οὖν ἐστι τὰ ἔργα τοῦ ἀγγέλου τῆς δικαιοσύνης.	These things, then, are the deeds of the angel of righteousness.
Καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ· οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν.	When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.
ἀλλὰ τούτων μὲν εἰς αὖθίς σε τιμωρήσομαι·	I will have my revenge on you for this another time
ἀλλ’ εἴ μοι ἐθελήσαις αὐτὸν ποιῆσαι εἰς λόγους ἐλθεῖν, ἴσως ἂν δυναίμην σοι ἐπιδεῖξαι ἃ χρὴ αὐτῷ διαλέγεσθαι ἀντὶ τούτων ὧν οὗτοι λέγειν τε καὶ ᾁδειν φασί σε.	but if you will agree to get him to have a talk with me, I daresay I could show you an example of the conversation you should hold with him, instead of those things that your friends say you speak and sing.
πρὸς μὲν οὖν Κράσσον τοιοῦτος.	Such, then, was his treatment of Crassus.
γενομένων δὲ παίδων ἀρρένων καὶ θηλειῶν, τροφὴν μέν που καὶ παιδείαν τὸ μετὰ ταῦτα λέγειν ὀρθότατ’ ἂν γίγνοιθ’ ἡμῖν, ἣν εἶναι μὲν ἄρρητον πάντως ἀδύνατον, λεγομένη δὲ διδαχῇ τινι καὶ νουθετήσει μᾶλλον ἢ νόμοις εἰκυῖ’ ἂν ἡμῖν φαίνοιτο.	Now that our children, of both sexes, are born, our proper course will be to deal in the next place with their nurture and education. This is a subject which it is wholly impossible to pass over but obviously it can be treated more suitably by way of precept and exhortation than by legislation.
πεποίηται δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ βωμοῦ καὶ Ἡρακλῆς ὑπὸ Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ θεῶν τῶν ἄλλων καὶ οὗτος ἀγόμενος ἐς οὐρανόν.	Wrought on the altar is also Heracles he too is being led to heaven by Athena and the other gods.
καὶ τὰ μὲν δὴ περὶ Μαντινείας οὕτω διεπέπρακτο, σοφωτέρων γενομένων ταύτῃ γε τῶν ἀνθρώπων τὸ μὴ διὰ τειχῶν ποταμὸν ποιεῖσθαι.	Thus ended the affair of the Mantineans, whereby men were made wiser in this point at least — not to let a river run through city walls.
τούτους γὰρ ἂν ἔφη οἴεσθαι μάλιστα ἂν αἰδεῖσθαι ἀλλήλους ἀπολιπεῖν, θαυμαστὰ λέγων, εἴ γε οἱ ψόγου τε ἀφροντιστεῖν καὶ ἀναισχυντεῖν πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐθιζόμενοι, οὗτοι μάλιστ’ αἰσχύνονται αἰσχρόν τι ποιεῖν.	for that of all the men in the world they would be the most ashamed to desert one another. Saying a very strange thing,—if men who are accustomed utterly to disregard all blame, and to behave with utter shamelessness to one another, would be the men above all others ashamed to do anything disgraceful.
φασὶ δέ τινες καὶ ἐν Πανιωνίῳ καὶ ἐν Κορίνθῳ καὶ ἐν Δελφοῖς συνελθεῖν αὐτούς.	Some make them meet at the Pan-Ionian festival, at Corinth, and at Delphi.
λέγω μὴν ὅτι ποιηταί τε ἡμῖν εἰσίν τινες ἐπῶν ἑξαμέτρων πάμπολλοι καὶ τριμέτρων καὶ πάντων δὴ τῶν λεγομένων μέτρων, οἱ μὲν ἐπὶ σπουδήν, οἱ δ’ ἐπὶ γέλωτα ὡρμηκότες, ἐν οἷς φασι δεῖν οἱ πολλάκις μυρίοι τοὺς ὀρθῶς παιδευομένους τῶν νέων τρέφειν καὶ διακορεῖς ποιεῖν, πολυηκόους τ’ ἐν ταῖς ἀναγνώσεσιν ποιοῦντας καὶ πολυμαθεῖς, ὅλους ποιητὰς ἐκμανθάνοντας·	I verily affirm that we have composers of verses innumerable—hexameters, trimeters, and every meter you could mention,—some of whom aim at the serious, others at the comic on whose writings, as we are told by our tens of thousands of people, we ought to rear and soak the young, if we are to give them a correct education, making them, by means of recitations, lengthy listeners and large learners, who learn off whole poets by heart.
ἀληθέστατα, ἔφην ἐγώ, λέγεις.	That is the very truth, I said.
Ὁ δὲ πλεῖστος ὄχλος ἔστρωσαν ἑαυτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ· ἄλλοι δὲ ἔκοπτον κλάδους ἀπὸ τῶν δένδρων, καὶ ἐστρώννυον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.	And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
καὶ τίς ὑμᾶς ἀναγκάσαι δύναται συγκαταθέσθαι τῷ ψευδεῖ φαινομένῳ;	Why, who can compel you to assent to what appears false?
καί μοι δοκοῦμεν τῇδε ἄν πῃ τάχιστα εὑρεῖν.	I think we can find out most quickly in this way.
ὅπερ ἐξηγούμενος δρᾶμα Δίδυμος ὅμοιά φησιν εἶναι τὰ γήθυα τοῖς λεγομένοις ἀμπελοπράσοις, τὰ δ’ αὐτὰ καὶ γηθυλλίδας λέγεσθαι.	And Didymus, interpreting that play, says that the γήθυον resembles the leek called the vine-leek, or ἀμπελόπρασον and he says that they are also called ἐπιθυλλίδες.
ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ περὶ τὰς ἐν τοῖς φυσικοῖς εἰρημένας αἰτίας τὴν ἐπιζητουμένην ἐπιστήμην θετέον·	Nor must we suppose that the science which we are seeking is concerned with the causes described in the Physics.
καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη ἃ ἐμίανεν Ἄχας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἀποστασίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἡτοιμάκαμεν καὶ ἡγνίκαμεν· ἰδού ἐστιν ἐναντίον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου Κυρίου.	and all the implements that King Ahaz tainted during his dominion in his defection. We have prepared and cleansed. Behold, it is in front of the altar of the Lord.”
εἰς τίνας ἀπίδωσιν ἐλθόντες εἰς τὰ θέατρα ἢ ὑμᾶς;	to whose example should they look when they go to the theatre except yours?
διότι φυλὴν περιμένω σφόδρα φιλονικοῦσαν λαχεῖν τιν’.	Because I think that I shall draw by lot Some most ambitious tribe
ἀλλ᾽ ἀντιβολῶ πρὸς τῶν γονάτων σ᾽ Εὐριπίδη, δός μοι ῥάκιόν τι τοῦ παλαιοῦ δράματος.	but, euripides, on my knees i beseech you, give me the tatters of some old piece
τὸν δὲ Ἀράξην κληθῆναι νομίζουσι κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα τὴν πρὸς τὸν Πηνειὸν ὑπὸ τῶν περὶ τὸν Ἄρμενον ὁμωνύμως ἐκείνῳ· καλεῖσθαι γὰρ Ἀράξην κἀκεῖνον διὰ τὸ ἀπαράξαι τὴν Ὄσσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀλύμπου ῥήξαντα τὰ Τέμπη·	It is supposed that Armenus and his companions called the Araxes by this name on account of its resemblance to the Peneius, for the Peneius had the name of Araxes from bursting through Tempe, and rending (a)pao|a/cai) Ossa from Olympus.
ἦν δὲ λόφος καρτερὸς καὶ ἑκατέρωθεν αὐτοῦ χαράδρα κρημνώδης, ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ Ἀκραῖον λέπας.	This was at a steep hill, on either side whereof was the channel of a torrent with steep and rocky banks and it is called Acraeum Lepas.
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ κακοῦργος ἐνδεδειγμένος φόνου δίκην φεύγω, ὃ οὐδεὶς πώποτ’ ἔπαθε τῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ.	First, whereas an information has been lodged against me as a malefactor, I am being tried for murder a thing which has never before happened to anyone in this country.
ὕστερον δ’ Ἀντιόχου χειρωσαμένου τὰς ἐν τῇ κοίλῃ Συρίᾳ πόλεις, ἃς ὁ Σκόπας κατεσχήκει, καὶ τὴν Σαμάρειαν, ἑκουσίως αὐτῷ προσέθεντο οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ τῇ πόλει δεξάμενοι πᾶσαν αὐτοῦ τῇ τε στρατιᾷ καὶ τοῖς ἐλέφασιν ἀφθονίαν παρέσχον καὶ τοὺς ὑπὸ Σκόπα καταλειφθέντας ἐν τῇ ἄκρᾳ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων φρουροὺς πολιορκοῦντι προθύμως συνεμάχησαν.	But afterward, when Antiochus subdued those cities of Celesyria which Scopas had gotten into his possession, and Samaria with them, the Jews, of their own accord, went over to him, and received him into the city [Jerusalem], and gave plentiful provision to all his army, and to his elephants, and readily assisted him when he besieged the garrison which was in the citadel of Jerusalem.
ὁ δὲ τούτων τε ἀπέλαυε καὶ τὴν ἀρετήν, ἥτις ἦν περὶ αὐτόν, οὐδ’ ὑπὸ τῆς μεταβολῆς ἐγκατέλιπεν, ἀλλὰ διέδειξε τὸ φρόνημα κρατεῖν τῶν ἐν τῷ βίῳ δυσκόλων δυνάμενον, οἷς ἂν παρῇ γνησίως καὶ μὴ πρὸς τὰς εὐπραγίας τὰς κατὰ καιρὸν μόνον ἡρμοσμένον.	So he enjoyed these advantages, yet did not he leave that virtue which he had before, upon such a change of his condition but he demonstrated that wisdom was able to govern the uneasy passions of life, in such as have it in reality, and do not only put it on for a show, under a present state of prosperity.
εἰ δέ που μὴ εἴη ἐπίτροπος, τὸν πρεσβύτατον ἀπὸ σκηνῆς·	but if a commissary officer should be lacking anywhere, the oldest man from that tent should come.
παρ’ οὐδενὶ δὲ τῶν πρὸ ἡμῶν εἰρημένον.	since that word is not used by any of the writers previous to our own time.
ἄλλοι δὲ ἑπτὰ στάχυες λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι ἀνεφύοντο ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν·	And another seven ears of corn, thin and blighted, were growing up close to them.
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς μέ Αὕτη ἡ ἀρὰ ἡ ἐκπορευομένη ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς· διότι πᾶς ὁ κλέπτης ἐκ τούτου ἕως θανάτου ἐκδικηθήσεται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἐπίορκος ἐκ τούτου ἐκδικηθήσεται.	And he said to me, “This is the curse, the one going out upon the face of all the land, because every thief will be punished until death from this, and everyone who swears falsely will be punished from this.
ἐλευθεριότης δὲ περὶ χρήματα εὐποιητική, ἀνελευθερία δὲ τοὐναντίον.	Liberality does good in many matters the contrary is avarice.
οὔκουν ποτ’ ἐκ τούτοιν γε μὴ σκήπτροιν ἔτι ὁδοιπορήσῃς·	So those two staffs will never again support your path.
ἢ πότεροι τοὺς ἱππέας προὔδοσαν, ὧν προδοθέντων Ὄλυνθος ἀπώλετο;	Which betrayed the cavalry, whose betrayal sealed the doom of Olynthus?
γήμας δὲ συγγενῆ τινα καὶ τρεῖς ποιησάμενος ἐξ αὐτῆς παῖδας ἤγετο ὕστερον καὶ τὴν ἐκ τῆς Ἀψαλώμου θυγατρὸς Θαμάρης Μαχάνην ὄνομα καὶ αὐτὴν οὖσαν συγγενῆ: καὶ παῖς ἐξ αὐτῆς ἄρρην αὐτῷ γίνεται, ὃν Ἀβίαν προσηγόρευσεν. τεκνοῖ δὲ καὶ ἐξ ἄλλων γυναικῶν πλειόνων, ἁπασῶν δὲ μᾶλλον ἔστερξε τὴν Μαχάνην.	Then he married one of his own clan and with her had three children and then married also another relative, the daughter of Absalom by Tamar, named Machanes and with her had a son whom he named Abias. He also had many other children by other wives, but he loved Machanes above them all.
ὅπερ ἥκιστα φαίνεσθαι πράττων ἐβούλετο.	This was the very last idea he desired should go abroad
ὥστε δῆλον ὅτι καὶ τῆς οἰκονομικῆς ἂν εἴη καὶ κτήσασθαι οἶκον καὶ χρήσασθαι αὐτῷ.	from which we infer that Housecraft also tells us first how to acquire a household and then how to conduct its affairs.
τὸ δὲ σύμπαν ἀμήτου περὶ τὴν γῆν ὑποφανέντος οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ πέντε μυριάδας ἀνθρώπων, οὓς αὐτὸς ἔθρεψεν καὶ περιεποίησεν, εἰς τὴν χώραν διέπεμψεν, καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον κακωθεῖσαν αὐτῷ τὴν βασιλείαν ὑπὸ πάσης φιλοτιμίας καὶ σπουδῆς ἀναλαβὼν οὐχ ἥκιστα καὶ τοὺς πέριξ ἐν ταῖς αὐταῖς κακοπαθείαις ὄντας ἐπεκούφισεν.	Upon the whole, when the harvest of the land was approaching, he sent no fewer than fifty thousand men, whom he had sustained, into the country by which means he both repaired the afflicted condition of his own kingdom with great generosity and diligence, and lightened the afflictions of his neighbors, who were under the same calamities
ὡς οὖν καὶ ταῦτ’ ἀληθῆ ἐστιν, ἀκούσατε αὐτοῦ τοῦ λαβόντος τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ θάψαντος αὐτήν.	To prove that these also are true facts, hear the statement of the actual person who received the money and buried her.
μιᾶς γὰρ χειρὸς ἀσθενὴς μάχη.	for ’tis feeble fighting with a single arm.
ἀλλ᾽ ἤτοι μὲν ταῦτα μεταφρασόμεσθα καὶ αὖτις,  νῦν δ᾽ ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν,  ἐν δ᾽ ἐρέτας ἐπιτηδὲς ἀγείρομεν, ἐς δ᾽ ἑκατόμβην  θείομεν, ἂν δ᾽ αὐτὴν Χρυσηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον  βήσομεν:	But these things we will consider hereafter. Let us now drag a black ship to the shining sea, and quickly gather suitable rowers into it, and place on board a hecatomb, and embark on it the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses herself.
ἅμα δὲ καὶ τοὺς μαχομένους ἀνεκαλεῖτο καὶ κατάζευξιν ἐσήμαινεν, ὡς σκιᾶς γοῦν μεταλάβοιεν οἱ στρατιῶται.	At the same time, too, he called his men back from fighting and gave the signal for pitching the tents, that the soldiers might at least enjoy the shade a little.
ἐπεὶ δὲ συμβέβηκεν εἶναι τὴν μουσικὴν τῶν ἡδέων, τὴν δ’ ἀρετὴν περὶ τὸ χαίρειν ὀρθῶς καὶ φιλεῖν καὶ μισεῖν, δεῖ δηλονότι μανθάνειν καὶ συνεθίζεσθαι μηθὲν οὕτως ὡς τὸ κρίνειν ὀρθῶς καὶ τὸ χαίρειν τοῖς ἐπιεικέσιν ἤθεσι καὶ ταῖς καλαῖς πράξεσιν·	And since it is the case that music is one of the things that give pleasure, and that virtue has to do with feeling delight and love and hatred rightly, there is obviously nothing that it is more needful to learn and become habituated to than to judge correctly and to delight in virtuous characters and noble actions
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἑώρα τὰς μὲν ὠκυμόρους τὴν ὀξύτητα τοῦ θανάτου δι’ ὀδύνης ἐπιφερούσας, τὰς δὲ πρᾳοτέρας τάχος οὐκ ἐχούσας, τῶν θηρίων ἀπεπειρᾶτο, θεωμένης αὐτῆς ἕτερον ἑτέρῳ προσφερόντων.	But when she saw that the speedy poisons enhanced the sharpness of death by the pain they caused, while the milder poisons were not quick, she made trial of venomous animals, watching with her own eyes as they were set one upon another.
τοῦτο δὲ καὶ Πλάτων εἴρηκεν ὅτι παρ’ οἷς πλεῖστοι νόμοι καὶ δίκαι παρὰ τούτοις καὶ βίοι μοχθηροί, καθάπερ καὶ παρ’ οἷς ἰατροὶ πολλοὶ καὶ νόσους εἰκὸς εἶναι πολλάς.	Plato also has observed that where there are many laws, there there will be law-suits and evil lives, in the same way as, where there are many physicians, there it is likely there is much sickness.
ᾄσσω θανόντος Καπανέως τήνδ’ ἐς πυράν.	To yonder pyre where lies dead Capaneus, I will leap down.
’ ἐστὶ δὲ φιαλῶδες ποτήριον κατὰ τὸν Παριανὸν Πολυδεύκην. ΒΟΜΒΥΛΙΟΣ, θηρίκλειον Ῥοδιακόν, οὗ περὶ τῆς ἰδέας Σωκράτης φησίν·	and it is a cup of a flat shallow shape, like a φιάλη, according to the description given of it by Pollux the Parian. There is another kind of cup called the bombylius a sort of Rhodian Thericlean cup
ἡ σοφία δήπου, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, εὐτυχία ἐστίν·	Wisdom, I replied, is presumably good fortune
παρρησίας γὰρ οὐ δεῖται πόλεμος ὅταν δὲ κατάθωμαι τὰ ὅπλα συμβάσεων γενομένων, τότε παριὼν δημαγωγήσεις, καὶ ταῦτα ἔφη, λέγω τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ δικαίων ὑφιέμενος ἐμὸς γὰρ εἰ καί σὺ καί πάντες ὅσους εἴληφα τῶν πρὸς ἐμὲ στασιασάντων.	when, however, I have come to terms and laid down my arms, then thou shalt come before the people with thy harangues. And in saying this I waive my own just rights for thou art mine, thou and all of the faction hostile to me whom I have caught.
καὶ ταῦτα πάνθ’ οὕτω διαφυλάττουσιν οὐδεπώποτ’ οὔθ’ ὑμῖν οὔτε τοῖς προγόνοις μετεμέλησεν. ἔστι γὰρ δημοκρατίας φυλακὴ τῶν μὲν ἐχθρῶν ἢ βουλευομένους ἢ μαχομένους περιεῖναι, τῶν δὲ νόμων ἢ προαιρουμένους ἢ συναναγκαζομένους ἡττᾶσθαι.	Neither you nor your ancestors ever repented of observing these rules, for it is the salvation of democracy that it overcomes its enemies either by good counsel or by arms, but submits to its laws either by free choice or under constraint
Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ἰούδα, φιλήματι τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδίδως;	But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀσωμάτους εἶναι τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ ἀμόρφους, τὰ δὲ μεμορφῶσθαι.	Moreover, the principles are incorporeal and destitute of form, while the elements have been endowed with form.
ἢ ἰητρείη ξὺν ζωμῷ τινι διαχωρητικῷ, κοχλίαι ἄκρως ἑφθοὶ, καὶ ωὐτῶν δὲ χυμὸς ἢ τελλίνης·	Or the cure is to be made with some laxative soup snails much boiled, and their gravy, or that of limpet.
ἀλλ᾽ ὅ τι νοεῖτον εἴπατον τούτου πέρι.	but tell me what you two think about him.
πάντων δὲ ἀπαγορευσάντων, καθ’ ἓν αὐτὸς ἐξελὼν ἀκόντιον ἅπαντα ῥᾳδίως συνέκλασε·	When all refused, drawing out one by one, he easily broke them
ἡ γὰρ ξηρότης ῥηγματίας ποιέει εἶναι, καὶ τοῦ ὕδατος ἡ ψυχρότης.	For their dryness, combined with the coldness of the water, makes them liable to internal lacerations.
οὔ σε βουλόμεσθα, μῆτερ, οὔτ’ ἄγαν φοβεῖν λόγοις οὔτε θαρσύνειν.	Mother, we would neither alarm you unduly by our words nor raise your hopes too high.
ἐπώκελλον γὰρ τὰ πλοῖα τετιμημένα χρημάτων, καὶ οἱ ὁπλῖται περὶ τὰς κατάρσεις τῆς νήσου ἐφύλασσον.	And the Helotes were nothing tender in putting ashore, for they ran their galleys on ground, valued at a price in money and the men of arms also watched at all the landing places of the island.
ὅλως μὲν γὰρ ἁπάντων ἀδύνατον ἀπόδειξιν εἶναι εἰς ἄπειρον γὰρ ἂν βαδίζοι, ὥστε μηδ’ οὕτως εἶναι ἀπόδειξιν, εἰ δέ τινων μὴ δεῖ ζητεῖν ἀπόδειξιν, τίνα ἀξιοῦσιν εἶναι μᾶλλον τοιαύτην ἀρχὴν οὐκ ἂν ἔχοιεν εἰπεῖν.	For it is quite impossible that everything should have a proof the process would go on to infinity, so that even so there would be no proof. If on the other hand there are some things of which no proof need be sought, they cannot say what principle they think to be more self-evident.
καὶ ἐπὶ τούτῳ πολλάκις ἐθορυβήθη.	For this also he often provoked a clamour from the audience.
λείη μὲν κράμβη, ὁτὲ δ’ ἀγριὰς ἐμπίπτουσα σπειρομένῃς πολύφυλλος ἐνήβησε πρασιῇσιν ἢ οὔλη καπυροῖσιν ὀραμνῖτις πετάλοισιν ἢ ἐπιφοινίσσουσα καὶ αὐχμηρῇσιν ὁμοίη βατραχέη κύμη δὲ κακόχροος, ἣ μὲν ἔοικε πέλμασιν οἷσι πέδιλα παλίμβολα κασσύουοσιν·	. . There is another kind, of reddish colour, Like frogs in drought some of bad colour too Do come from Cyme, like the dingy soles Which cobblers often sew on worn-out boots
ἐξέτεινας τὴν δεξιάν σου· κατέπιεν αὐτοὺς γῆ.	You stretched out your right hand, the earth devoured them.
ἰὼ ἰὼ δωμάτων ἐρειψίτοιχοι καὶ πικρὰς μοναρχίας ἰδόντες, ἤδη διήλ- λαχθε σὺν σιδάρῳ.	To their misery, indeed, they found a miserable death in the outrage done their house. Ah, you brothers who were poised to cast over the walls of your home and looked—to your sorrow—for sole rule, now you have been reconciled by the iron sword.
καὶ σχεδὸν ὡς τὸ πολὺ ταῦτά τε καὶ τὴν σώφρονα φύσιν καὶ τὴν ἀνδρείαν τὴν τῶν ἐναντίων, οἷον πολεμίαν διαλαχούσας στάσιν ἰδέας, οὔτ’ ἀλλήλαις μειγνυμένας ἐφευρίσκομεν ἐν ταῖς περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πράξεσιν, ἔτι τε τοὺς ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτὰς ἴσχοντας διαφερομένους ἀλλήλοις ὀψόμεθα ἐὰν μεταδιώκωμεν.	and almost always we find that the restraint of one class of qualities and the courage of the opposite class, like two parties arrayed in hostility to each other, do not mix with each other in the actions that are concerned with such qualities. Moreover, if we pursue the inquiry, we shall see that the men who have these qualities in their souls are at variance with one another.
“Ἐν οἷς πᾶαιν τῷ προειρημένῳ σώματι τῶν Χριατιανῶν τὴν απουδὴν δυνατώτατα παρασχεῖν ὀφείλεις, ὅπως τὸ ἡμέτερον κέλευσμα τὴν ταχίστην παραπληρωθῇ, ὅπως καὶ ἐν τούτῳ διὰ τῆς ἡμετέρας χρηστότητος πρόνοια γένηται τῆς κοινῆς καὶ δημοσίας ἡσυχίας.	“In all these things thou Shouldest use all the diligence in thy power for the above-mentioned corporation of the Christians, that this our command may be fulfilled with all speed, so that in this also, through our kindness, thought may be taken for the common and publie peace. For by this method, as we have also said before, the divine care for us, which we have already experienced in many matters, will remain stedfast1 . .
οἳ δ’ ἂν ἐν ἑκάστῃ τάξει κρατήσωσιν, ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν αὖθις θέουσι τῶν ἄθλων·	The victors in each heat run again for the prize.
πολὺ γὰρ προὐργιαίτερον ἡγεῖται εἶναι τὸ χρηματίζεσθαι ἢ τὴν ἐμὴν συγγένειαν.	for he considers that to make money is much more important than his kinship with me.
καὶ λόφον ὁ Θέρμος ἐν στενῇ διόδῳ καταλαβών, ἔκτεινε τῶν Λιβύων ἐς τετρακισχιλίους καὶ ἐζώγρησεν ἑτέρους τοσούσδε, καὶ τὴν ἀγορὰν ἧκε φέρων τῷ Σκιπίωνι.	Thermus took a position on the crest of a hill at a narrow pass, where he killed 4000 Africans, took as many more prisoners, and brought the supplies to Scipio.
οἱ πλείονες δὲ αὐτῶν τραυματίαι γυμνοὶ διεσώθησαν· καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Λυσίας αἰσχρῶς φεύγων διεσώθη.	But the majority of them escaped wounded and unarmed. And even Lysias himself escaped by fleeing shamefully.
πρόκειται δὲ τῆς ᾐόνος ταύτης ὅ τε Σαρωνικὸς κόλπος καὶ ὁ Ἐλευσινιακός, τρόπον τινὰ ὁ αὐτὸς ὤν, συνεχὴς τῷ Ἑρμιονικῷ.	In front of this coast lies the Saronic Gulf, and the Eleusiniac, which is almost the same, and continuous with the Hermionic.
καὶ ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψητε πρὸς μέ, καὶ φυλάξητε τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ ποιήσητε αὐτάς, ἐὰν ᾖ ἡ διασπορὰ ὑμῶν ἀπ᾽ ἄκρου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἐκεῖθεν συνάξω αὐτούς, καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἐξελεξάμην κατασκηνῶσαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ.	And if you return to me and keep my commands and do them, if your dispersion is to the farthest point of the heavens, from there I will gather them and lead them into the place that I chose my name to encamp there.’
πόλεος ὡς ἄρχων ἀνὴρ πᾶς, ξύνεσιν ἢν ἔχων τύχῃ.	since any man, with ordinary intelligence, can govern a state.
καὶ μὴν ἡ πολὺ θαυμαζομένη πολιτεία τοῦ τὴν Στωικῶν αἵρεσιν καταβαλομένου Ζήνωνος εἰς ἓν τοῦτο συντείνει κεφάλαιον, ἵνα μὴ κατὰ πόλεις μηδὲ κατὰ δήμους οἰκῶμεν ἰδίοις ἕκαστοι διωρισμένοι δικαίοις, ἀλλὰ πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἡγώμεθα δημότας καὶ πολίτας, εἷς δὲ βίος καὶ κόσμος, ὥσπερ ἀγέλης συννόμου νόμῳ κοινῷ συντρεφομένης.	It is true indeed that the so much admired commonwealth of Zeno, first author of the Stoic sect, aims singly at this, that neither in cities nor in towns we should live under laws distinct one from another, but that we should look upon all men in general to be our fellow-countrymen and citizens, observing one manner of living and one kind of order, like a flock feeding together with equal right in one common pasture.
ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἐάσω, ἀπ’ αὐτῶν δ’ ὧν αὐτὸς βεβίωκεν ἄρξομαι·	I will pass by those early days, and begin with his conduct of his own life
Μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον Παλαιστῖνοι τελευτήσαντα κρατοῦσι τῶν Ἰσραηλιτῶν καὶ φόρους παρ' αὐτῶν ἐλάμβανον ἐπ' ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα.	After his death, the Philistines overcame the Israelites and took tax from them for forty years
πικροὶ γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἥξετ’, ἐκτεθραμμένοι σκύμνοι λεόντων, πόλεος ἐκπορθήτορες.	For to their sorrow shall ye come like lion’s whelps in full-grown might to sack their city.
Ἀκούσασα δὲ ἡ Τερτία ταῦτα παρὰ τῆς Μυγδονίας εἶπεν·	And when Tertia heard this of Mygdonia she said
ἡ μὲν γὰρ ὑπόστασίς σου τὴν σὴν γλυκύτητα πρὸς τέκνα ἐνεφάνισεν, τῇ δὲ τοῦ προσφερομένου ἐπιθυμίᾳ ὑπηρετῶν πρὸς ὅ τις ἐβούλετο μετεκιρνᾶτο.	For your provision showed your sweetness to your children, and, serving the desire ⌊of the person taking it⌋, it was changed to what anyone wished.
ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν μετέχουσι· ὅσοι δὲ φύσει μὲν πολῖταί εἰσι, γνώμῃ δὲ χρῶνται ὡς πᾶσα γῆ πατρὶς αὐτοῖς ἐστιν ἐν ᾗ ἂν τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἔχωσιν, οὗτοι δῆλοί εἰσιν ὅτι κἂν παρέντες τὸ τῆς πόλεως κοινὸν ἀγαθὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἑαυτῶν ἴδιον κέρδος ἔλθοιεν διὰ τὸ μὴ τὴν πόλιν ἀλλὰ τὴν οὐσίαν πατρίδα ἑαυτοῖς ἡγεῖσθαι.	But those who, though citizens by birth, adopt the view that any country in which they have their business is their fatherland, are evidently men who would even abandon the public interest of their city to seek their private gain, because they regard their fortune, not the city, as their fatherland.
πολέα δ᾽ ἔσχ᾽ ἐν ἀγκάλαις νεοτρόφου τέκνου δίκαν, φαιδρωπὸς ποτὶ χεῖρα σαί - νων τε γαστρὸς ἀνάγκαις.	gentle as yet, a true child - lover, and, to men of age, a thing whereat pride warms; and oft he had it in his arms like any new - born babe, bright - faced, to hand wagging its tail, at belly's strict command.
ὡς δ' εἰς τὸ ἄδυτον αὐτὴν εἰσενεγκεῖν ἔδει, τὸ μὲν ἄλλο πλῆθος μετέστη, μόνοι δὲ κομίσαντες οἱ ἱερεῖς μεταξὺ τῶν δύο Χερουβὶμ κατέθεσαν:	when it was transferred into the Holy of Holies, the rest of the people left and only the priests carrying it set it between the two cherubims.
μεθ’ οὓς ἐπορεύετο Φιλίσκος ὁ ποιητὴς ἱερεὺς ὢν Διονύσου καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνῖται.	After them marched Philiscus the poet, being a priest of Bacchus, and with him all the artisans who were concerned in the service of Bacchus.
ᾧ καὶ δῆλον ὅτι μεγίστην εἶχεν δύναμιν ὁ ἄρχων·	this shows that the archon had very great power
σὺ δὲ πάσης κακίας εὑρετὴς γενόμενος εἰς τοὺς Ἐβραίους οὐ μὴ διαφύγῃς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ θεοῦ.	But you, having become an inventor of all kinds of wickedness against the Hebrews, you shall ⌊certainly not⌋ escape from the hands of God.
δύο γὰρ ἦσαν στρατοπεδεῖαι, μία μὲν ἣν Ἀσδρούβας εἶχε μετὰ πεζῶν τρισμυρίων καὶ τρισχιλίων ἱππέων, ἄλλη δὲ περὶ δέκα σταδίους ἀφεστῶσα ταύτης, ἡ τῶν Νομάδων, ἱππεῖς μὲν εἰς μυρίους ἔχουσα, πεζοὺς δὲ περὶ πεντακισμυρίους.	For there were two camps, one that of Hasdrubal, containing thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry and another about ten stades distant from it of the Numidians, containing ten thousand cavalry and about fifty thousand infantry.
δοκεῖ μοι, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, τὸ ὑπόλοιπον ἐν τῇ πόλει ὧν ἐσκέμμεθα, σωφροσύνης καὶ ἀνδρείας καὶ φρονήσεως, τοῦτο εἶναι, ὃ πᾶσιν ἐκείνοις τὴν δύναμιν παρέσχεν ὥστε ἐγγενέσθαι, καὶ ἐγγενομένοις γε σωτηρίαν παρέχειν, ἕωσπερ ἂν ἐνῇ.	I think that this is the remaining virtue in the state after our consideration of soberness, courage, and intelligence, a quality which made it possible for them all to grow up in the body politic and which when they have sprung up preserves them as long as it is present.
παύσω τιν᾽ ὑμῶν τῆσδ᾽ ἐγὼ τῆς ἐξόδου.	i'll put a stop to these surprise - parties.
Πρὸς ταῦτα ἀγανακτήσας Πομπήιος Ἀριστόβουλον μὲν ἐφρούρει, πρὸς δὲ τὴν πόλιν ἐλθὼν περιεσκόπει ὅπως δεῖ προσβαλεῖν, τήν τε ὀχυρότητα τῶν τειχῶν δυσμεταχείριστον ὁρῶν καὶ τὴν πρὸ τούτων φάραγγα φοβερὰν τό τε ἱερὸν ἐντὸς τῆς φάραγγος ὀχυρώτατα τετειχισμένον, ὥστε τοῦ ἄστεος ἁλισκομένου δευτέραν εἶναι καταφυγὴν τοῦτο τοῖς πολεμίοις.	Angry at this treatment, Pompey kept Aristobulus in custody. When he came to the city, he looked round to see best to attack, noting how the ramparts were so firm that it would be hard to overcome them, and the tremendous ravine before the ramparts, and that the temple on the edge of that ravine was itself surrounded with a very strong wall, so that if the city were taken, the temple would be a second place of refuge where the enemy could retreat.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν Εἰ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς πτύων ἐνέπτυσεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, οὐκ ἐντραπήσεται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας; ἀφορισθήτω ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται.	And the Lord said to Moses, “If her father had indeed spit in her face, would she not be turned out for seven days? Let her be shut out for seven days outside the encampment. And ⌊afterward⌋ she will reenter the camp.”
καὶ ὧδε τοὺς οἰκείους ἀλλήλοις τρόπους συνθεωρητέον, καὶ τὰς ἅμα συγκυρήσεις τινῶν ὅτι οὐκ ἀδύνατον γίνεσθαι.	And thus we must take in conjunction the explanations which agree with one another, and remember that the concurrence of more than one at the same time may not impossibly happen.
εἰκότως γε, ὦ Γοργία· οὐδὲν γάρ πω σαφὲς λέγω, πῶλος δὲ ὅδε νέος ἐστὶ καὶ ὀξύς.	And no wonder, Gorgias, for as yet my statement is not at all clear but Polus here is so young and fresh!
εἷς ἂν μόνος νιν τῶν ἐμῶν γνοίη φίλων.	There is only one of my friends who would recognize him.
παλίντονος γὰρ ἁρμονίη κόσμου, ὅκωσπερ λύρης καὶ τόξου· καὶ τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων καθαρὸν οὐδὲν οὐδ’ ἀμιγές.	For the harmony of the universe, like that of a lyre or a bow, is by alternatives, and in mortal affairs there is nothing pure and unmixed.
ἦν δ’ ἐπιφανὴς καὶ ἔντιμος ἡ χρεία.	and that office is very eminent and honourable.
ἔστι δὲ χωρίον, ὃ τριῶν μεταξὺ ποταμῶν κείμενον ὅμοιόν τι νήσῳ τὴν φύσιν ὑπάρχει, τοῦ μὲν Ἀρνῶνος ἀπὸ μεσημβρίας ὁρίζοντος αὐτό, Ἰοβάκου δὲ τὴν ἀρκτῴαν αὐτοῦ πλευρὰν περιγράφοντος, ὃς εἰς τὸν Ἰόρδανον ποταμὸν ἐκβάλλων ἐκείνῳ καὶ τοῦ ὀνόματος μεταδίδωσι, τὰ μέντοι γε πρὸς τῇ δύσει τοῦ χωρίου περίεισιν αὐτὴν Ἰόρδανος.	Hereupon the Hebrews took possession of their land, which is a country situate between three rivers, and naturally resembled an island the river Arnon being its southern the river Jabbok determining its northern side, which running into Jordan loses its own name, and takes the other while Jordan itself runs along by it, on its western coast.
καλεῖν δὲ τὸ ἄλσος Ἀμαθουσίους, ἐν ᾧ τὸν τάφον δεικνύουσιν, Ἀριάδνης Ἀφροδίτης.	and that they call the grove in which they show her tomb, the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite.
ὑπερειπόμενος δὲ τῷ γήρᾳ, ἄχρι τῶν ὅπλων καὶ τῶν στρατευμάτων ἄκρατος ἦν καὶ ἀρχαῖος αὐτοκράτωρ, Οὐινίῳ δὲ καὶ Λάκωνι καὶ τοῖς ἀπελευθέροις πάντα τὰ πράγματα πωλοῦσι παρέχων ἑαυτόν, οἷον Νέρων παρεῖχε τοῖς ἀπληστοτάτοις, οὐδένα ποθοῦντα τὴν ἀρχήν, οἰκτείραντας δὲ τοὺς πολλοὺς τὸν θάνατον ἀπέλιπεν.	But being gradually weighed down by his years, in arms and camps, indeed, he was an imperator of a severe and ancient type but just as Nero put himself in the hands of his most insatiate favourites, so Galba put himself in the hands of Vinius and Laco and their freedmen, and they made merchandise of everything, so that he left behind him no one who wished him still in power, but very many who were moved to pity at his death.
οὐδ’ ὁ Σκήψιος δὲ Δημήτριος εὖ, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ Ἀπολλοδώρῳ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἐνίων αἴτιος ἐκεῖνος κατέστη.	Demetrius of Skepsis is also wrong, and, in fact, the cause of some of the mistakes of Apollodorus.
ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐψηφίσαντο αὐτῷ τὴν ἄδειαν, ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τῇ Πουλυτίωνος γίγνοιτο μυστήρια·	As soon as immunity had been voted him, he stated that Mysteries had been celebrated in Pulytion's house.
Παρορμήσας οὖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐπὶ τοὺς Χαναναίους στρατιὰν ἐξάγειν, ὡς τοῦ θεοῦ συνεργοῦντος οἷς ἂν ἐπιχειρήσειε, καὶ πᾶσαν ἐπευφημήσας τὴν πληθύν, "ἐπεί, φησί, πρὸς τοὺς ἡμετέρους ἄπειμι προγόνους καὶ θεὸς τήνδε μοι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς πρὸς ἐκείνους ἀφίξεως ὥρισε,	After encouraging Joshua to lead out the army against the Canaanites, telling him that God would help him in all his undertakings and blessing the whole population, he said, "As I am going to my ancestors and God has decided that this is my day to leave them,
πεμφθεὶς γὰρ ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἐξεταστὴς τῶν ἐν Ἐρετρίᾳ ξένων, μόνος τῶν ἐξεταστῶν ὡμολόγει λαβεῖν ἀργύριον, καὶ οὐ περὶ τοῦ πράγματος ἀπελογεῖτο, ἀλλ’ εὐθὺς περὶ τοῦ τιμήματος ἱκέτευεν ὁμολογῶν ἀδικεῖν.	You will recall that you sent him as an inspector of the mercenary troops in Eretria. He and he only of the board of inspectors acknowledged that he had taken money, and made no defence against the charge, but immediately admitted his guilt, making his plea only as to the penalty.
ὃ καὶ Πλάτων ἐποίησε πρὸς τὸν Λυσίου λόγον.	and this is what Plato actually did for the discourse of Lysias.
τὴν δὲ Λᾶν οἱ Διόσκουροί ποτε ἐκ πολιορκίας ἑλεῖν ἱστοροῦνται, ἀφ’ οὗ δὴ Λαπέρσαι προσηγορεύθησαν.	With respect to Las, the Dioscuri are said to have taken it by siege formerly, whence they had the name of Lapers, (Destroyers of Las,) and Sophocles says somewhere, by the two Lapers, by Eurotas, by the gods in Argos and Sparta.
καιροὺς μέντοι τοιούσδε ἔχει·	the following are the proper occasions for administering it.
ὁ δὲ θαρρεῖν τε προτρέπεται καὶ βοηθήσειν αὐτοῖς τὸν θεὸν ἐπαγγέλλεται καὶ λαβὼν ἄρνα γαλαθηνόν, ὑπὲρ τῶν ὄχλων θύει καὶ παρακαλεῖ τὸν θεὸν ὑπερσχεῖν αὐτῶν τὴν δεξιὰν ἐν τῇ πρὸς Παλαιστίνους μάχῃ καὶ μὴ περιιδεῖν αὐτοὺς δεύτερον δυστυχήσαντας.	But he bade them raise their spirits and promised them God's help, and then taking a suckling lamb, he sacrificed it for the crowds and implored God to raise his right hand over them when they fought the Philistines and not to abandon them or let them fall into a second defeat.
ἐπεὶ γὰρ ἀπὸ Βρεντεσίου Πομπήιον διώκων ἀνήχθη πρὸ μιᾶς ἡμέρας νωνῶν Ἰανουαρίων, χειμῶνος ἐν τροπαῖς ὄντος, τὸ μὲν πέλαγος ἀσφαλῶς διεπέρασε, τῆς Τύχης τὸν καιρὸν ὑπερθεμένης·	For when he loosed from Brundisium, and embarked in pursuit of Pompey, on the fourth day of January, though it was then the latter end of winter, he passed over the sea in safety by the good conduct of Fortune, which was stronger than the rigor of the season.
ἔγραψα δὲ περὶ τούτων καὶ Κουσπίῳ Φάδῳ τῷ ’μῷ ἐπιτρόπῳ.	Now I have written about these affairs to Cuspius Fadus, my procurator.
τὸν δὲ Σπερχειὸν ἀλλάξαι τὸ ῥεῖθρον καὶ ποιῆσαι πλωτὰς τὰς ὁδούς, τὸν δὲ Βοάγριον κατ’ ἄλλης ἐνεχθῆναι φάραγγος, καὶ Ἀλόπης δὲ καὶ Κύνου καὶ Ὀποῦντος πολλὰ καταβλαβῆναι μέρη, Οἶον δὲ τὸ ὑπερκείμενον φρούριον πᾶν ἀνατραπῆναι, Ἐλατείας δὲ τοῦ τείχους καταρραγῆναι μέρος, περὶ δὲ Ἄλπωνον θεσμοφορίων ὄντων πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι παρθένους ἀναδραμούσας εἰς πύργον τῶν ἐλλιμενίων κατὰ θέαν, πεσόντος τοῦ πύργου, πεσεῖν καὶ αὐτὰς εἰς τὴν θάλατταν.	that the course of the Sperchius was changed, thus rendering navigable what formerly were highways that the Boagrius flowed through another channel that many parts of Alope, Cynus, and Opus were injured, and the castle of um, which commands the latter city, entirely overturned. That part of the wall of Elateia was thrown down
μὴ εἴπῃς Τίσομαι τὸν ἐχθρόν· ἀλλὰ ὑπόμεινον τὸν κύριον, ἵνα σοι βοηθήσῃ.	Do not say, “I will avenge myself against an enemy.” But wait for the Lord, so that he may help you.
δίκη γὰρ οὐκ ἔνεστ’ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς βροτῶν, ὅστις πρὶν ἀνδρὸς σπλάγχνον ἐκμαθεῖν σαφῶς στυγεῖ δεδορκώς, οὐδὲν ἠδικημένος.	For there is no just discernment in the eyes of men, for they, or ever they have surely learnt their neighbour’s heart, loathe him at first sight, though never wronged by him
οἱ δὲ λειπόμενοι παραμένοντες ἐπολιόρκουν τὸ χωρίον.	The force thus left stayed on and besieged the place.
Πολιτείαν μὲν οὖν τοιάνδε Μωυσῆς κατέλιπε, νόμους δ' ἔτι πρότερον τεσσαρακοστῷ ἔτει γεγραμμένους παραδίδωσι, περὶ ὧν ἐν ἑτέρᾳ γραφῇ λέξομεν.	This was the polity left us by Moses, when in the fortieth year he wrote the laws which we will discuss in another book.
ἢν δὲ μὴ, οἷσιν ἂν ἐγγυτάτω τουτέων γίγνηται. ἀπόλλυνται δὲ οὓς ἂν ὅ τε πυρετὸς μὴ ἀφῇ, ἢ δοκέων αὐτέους ἀφιέναι, αὖθις φαίνηται ἀναθερμαινόμενος, καὶ δίψαν μὲν ἔχωσι, σιτίων δὲ μὴ ἐπιθυμέωσι, καὶ ἡ κοιλίη ὑγρὴ ᾖ, καὶ τὸ πῦον χλωρὸν ἢ πελιὸν πτύῃ, ἢ φλεγματῶδες καὶ ἀφρῶδες·	Those die whom the fever does not leave, or when appearing to leave them it returns with an exacerbation when they have thirst, but no desire of food, and there are watery discharges from the bowels when the expectoration is green or livid, or pituitous and frothy
τούτων οὖν μετὰ σοῦ, ὦ δέσποτα, γεγενημένων εἰκότως ἕπομαι κἀγώ· τὴν γὰρ βασιλείαν ἔλαβες παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ.	while these, therefore, my lord and master, are with thee, it is fit that I should follow them, for thou hast received the kingdom from God.
τότε μὲν οὖν πολλὰ τοιαῦτα διελέχθη πρὸς τοὺς φίλους, τοὺς δὲ τῶν τυράννων δεσμώτας, ὅσοι κατελήφθησαν ἐν τοῖς φρουρίοις, ἀνῆκεν.	He said many such things to his friends at the time, and set free those left in prison by the tyrants.
τῶν δ’ ἀγκίστρων τοῖς μὲν στρογγύλοις, ἐπὶ κεστρέας καὶ ἀμίας χρῶνται μικροστόμους ὄντας τὸ γὰρ εὐθύτερον εὐλαβοῦνται·	moreover, that they made use of round hooks to catch mullets and tunnies, in regard they had but small mouths, for that they were afraid of a straight hook.
Καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρὼν διαιρέσει Ναδὰβ καὶ Ἀβιούδ, Ἐλεαζὰρ καὶ Ἰθαμάρ·	Now the sons of Aaron in the division: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ Ὅτι ἠπειθήσατε τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις καὶ ἠλπίσατε ἐπὶ ψεύδει, καὶ ὅτι ἐγόγγυσας καὶ πεποιθὼς ἐγένου ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ,	Because of this, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you disobeyed these words and hoped on a lie, and because you grumbled and began trusting on this word,
τί οὖν, ἔφη, οὐ πυνθάνῃ εἰ καὶ ἐκείνῳ βουλομένῳ ταῦτ’ ἐστί;	Why, then, said he, do you not find out whether this is pleasing to him also?
ὅταν δὲ μία γένηται ἐξ αὐτῶν, ἀνάγκη τὸ συμπερανθὲν ἔνθα μὲν φάναι τὴν ψυχήν, ἐν δὲ ταῖς ποιητικαῖς πράττειν εὐθύς·	Now when the two premises are combined, just as in theoretic reasoning the mind is compelled to affirm the resulting conclusion, so in the case of practical premises you are forced at once to do it.
εἰ δὲ μή, ἀλλὰ καλῶς γε ἀποθνῄσκωμεν, ὑποχείριοι δὲ μηδέποτε γενώμεθα ζῶντες τοῖς πολεμίοις.	otherwise, let us at least die a glorious death, and never fall into the hands of our enemies alive.
μένειν δ’ αὐτόθι καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ διατρίβειν ὡς οὐκ ἐν ἄλλῳ τόπῳ λησόμενον οὕτως ἠξίου.	But he desired him to stay there, and abide with him, as in a place where he might be better concealed than any where else.
ἔχειν δὲ λέγουσιν αὐτὸ τοιαύτην ἀναπνοὴν ὥστε πάντα τὸν ἐντυχόντα τῷ ζῴῳ διαφθείρειν.	And they say that it has such a breath that it destroys every one who meets it
οἱ δὲ ὕστερον ἐπιγνόντες αὐτὸν νοσοῦντα, ἐπιτίθενται τῷ στρατεύματι καὶ κτείνουσι πολλούς.	But afterwards, being apprized of his illness, they attacked the army and slew many.
ἐν ἐπιτηδείῳ οὐ νοσήσεις;	Then you will be ill in an inconvenient one.
ἀλλὰ ἄλλους πέμψον, ἂν μή τινες ἐθέλοντες ἀγαθοὶ φαίνωνται.	Send others rather, unless some good men offer themselves as volunteers.
ἐλπὶς δ’ οὐκ ἀγαθὴ κεχρημένον ἄνδρα κομίζει, ἥμενον ἐν λέσχῃ, τῷ μὴ βίος ἄρκιος εἴη.	it is not a wholesome hope that accompanies a needy man who lolls at ease while he has no sure livelihood.
μάλα γέ τοι τὸ μεγάλας ὑγιείας ἀκόρεστον τέρμα·	Especially at least, of health that’s great The term’s insatiable
γίγνεται γοῦν παντοδαπὸς οὐ μόνον κατὰ τὴν μορφήν, ἀλλὰ καὶ κατὰ τοὺς λόγους· οὕτω ποικιλόφωνός τις ἐστίν.	Accordingly he changes into nearly every sort of person, not only in form, but also in his discourse, so very varied in voice he is.
καὶ ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ γλυκανεῖ ὁ ἐχθρός, καὶ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ βουλεύσεται ἀνατρέψαι σε εἰς βόθρον· ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ δακρύσει ὁ ἐχθρός, ⸂⸆⸃ καὶ ἐὰν εὕρῃ καιρόν, οὐκ ἐμπλησθήσεται ἀφ᾽ αἵματος·	An enemy speaks sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he will determine to throw you into a pit. An enemy will shed tears with his eyes, but if he finds an opportunity, he will not be satisfied with your blood.
οὐ χωρὶς μὲν πρὸς τὴν πολιτικὴν δύναμιν, χωρὶς δ’ ἐν Ἀμφίσσῃ πρὸς τοὺς ξένους διαγωνίσασθαι, ἀθύμους δὲ τοὺς Ἕλληνας λαβεῖν τηλικαύτης πληγῆς προγεγενημένης;	Would it not have been that he might in one place fight against the city's forces, and in another, in Amphissa, against the mercenaries, and thus close his hand upon the Greeks already discouraged by so great a disaster?
ἀλλὰ τί σοι δοκεῖ ἡ ῥητορικὴ εἶναι;	But what do you consider rhetoric to be?
ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ παρ’ ἕκαστον τάγμα πάντες ἐξ ἑαυτῶν τιθέασι φυλακήν·	And in the same way each maniple and squadron posts guards of their own men.
εἰ δὲ ὀρθῶς, τί φοβῇ τοὺς ἐπιπλήξοντας οὐκ ὀρθῶς;	but if it is right, why are you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly?
ῥῆμα δέ ἐστι μέρος λόγου σημαῖνον ἀσύνθετον κατηγόρημα, ὡς ὁ Διογένης, ἤ, ὥς τινες, στοιχεῖον λόγου ἄπτωτον, σημαῖνόν τι συντακτὸν περί τινος ἢ τινῶν, οἷον Γράφω, Λέγω·	A verb is, according to Diogenes, a part of speech signifying an isolated predicate, or, as othersdefine it, an un-declined part of a sentence, signifying something that can be attached to one or more subjects, e.g. I write, I speak.
τὸν οὖν Ἀγάθωνα πολλάκις κελεύειν μεταπέμψασθαι τὸν Σωκράτη, ἓ δὲ οὐκ ἐᾶν.	and though Agathon ever and anon gave orders that they should go and fetch him, my friend would not allow it.
τίς δ’ ἥδε χώρα καὶ τίνες ναίουσί νιν;	What land is this and who are its inhabitants?
ἀντὶ μὲν γὰρ τῶν τετρακισχιλίων μυρίους αὑτοὺς ἀπήγγελλον εἶναι, κατὰ δὲ τοὺς κινδύνους ἀνυποστάτους ὑπάρχειν καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς καὶ τοῖς καθοπλισμοῖς.	for instead of four thousand, it was reported at Carthage that they were ten thousand, and that their bravery and the excellency of their arms made them irresistible in the field.
πλήθους τε ἀνθρώπων ἑπομένου κατὰ θέαν, ὡς ἧκεν ἐπὶ τὸ χωρίον, ἤρετο τὸν στρατιώτην, εἰ διὰ μελέτης αὐτῷ γεγόνοιεν αἱ σφαγαὶ ἢ εἰ πρῶτον ἔχοι τὸ ξίφος ἐκέλευε κομίζειν ᾧ Γάιον μεταχειρίσαιτο αὐτός·	a wolf] And as a great many men went along with them to see the sight, when Cherea came to the place, he asked the soldier who was to be their executioner, whether this office was what he was used to, or whether this was the first time of his using his sword in that manner, and desired him to bring him that very sword with which he himself slew Caius.
μεθεκτὰ δέ, ὅσα ἔχειν μὲν μὴ ἐνδέχεται, μετασχεῖν δὲ αὐτῶν ἐνδέχεται·	To the next belong all those which, though they cannot be exclusively possessed, can be shared with others.
καὶ πρώτους μὲν τοὺς ἐπὶ τῷ Γρίζειν γενομένους εὔχεσθαι τὰ κάλλιστα τοῖς περὶ τὴν θρησκείαν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὴν τῶν νόμων φυλακὴν σπουδάσασιν ὧν τε Μωυσῆς εἶπε μὴ παρακουσαμένοις, εὐφημεῖν δὲ τὰς ἑτέρας, καὶ τούτων πάλιν εὐχομένων τὰς προηγμένας ἐπαινεῖν·	And that first, those that were upon Mount Gerizzim should pray for the best blessings upon those who were diligent about the worship of God, and the observation of his laws, and who did not reject what Moses had said to them while the other wished them all manner of happiness also and when these last put up the like prayers, the former praised them.
προφήτας δ’ οὔτινας ματεύομεν.	but prophets none are we in scent of!
ἔτεσι δὲ οὐ πολλοῖς ὕστερον ἔκ τε Ἀθηναίων καὶ ἐκ Βοιωτίας ἀφίκοντο ἄνδρες·	A few years later there came men from Athens and from Boeotia
σκύφιον δὲ λαβὼν δέπας ἔμμετρον ὡς τριλάγυνον πί ἐπισχόμενος, τὸ ῥὰ οἱ παρέθηκε Φόλος κεράσας.	And Stesichorus cans the cup on the board of Pholus the Centaur σκύφειον δέπας, using σκύφειον as synonymous to σκυφοειδές.. And he says, when speaking of Hercules– And taking a huge scyphus-shaped cup ʽσ̔κύπφειον δέπασ̓, Holding three measures, to his lips he raised it, Full of rich wine, which Pholus wisely mix'd And gave him and at one good draught he drank it.
καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὸ τῷ Βαροὺχ υἱῷ Νηρίου υἱῷ Μαασαίου κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς Ἁναμεὴλ υἱοῦ ἀδελφοῦ πατρός μου καὶ κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν παρεστηκότων καὶ γραφόντων ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τῆς κτήσεως καὶ κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων τῶν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς.	and I gave it to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, ⌊in the sight⌋ of Hanamel, son of my father’s brother, and ⌊in the sight⌋ of the people who stood by and wrote in the purchase scroll, and ⌊in the sight⌋ of the Judeans who were in the court of the guard.
τὸ κατ’ ἀξίαν γὰρ ἐπανισοῖ καὶ σῴζει τὴν φιλίαν, καθάπερ εἴρηται.	since requital in accordance with desert restores equality, and is the preservative of friendship, as has been said above.
ὅθεν ταχὺ συνωμολόγησά σοι τὰ ἐπιταχθέντα χθές, ἡγούμενος, ὅπερ ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς τοιοῖσδε μέγιστον ἔργον, λόγον τινὰ πρέποντα τοῖς βουλήμασιν ὑποθέσθαι, τούτου μετρίως ἡμᾶς εὐπορήσειν.	Consequently, I readily consented to the theme you proposed yesterday, since I thought that we should be reasonably well provided for the task of furnishing a satisfactory discourse—which in all such cases is the greatest task.
Ἀτρεὺς γὰρ ἄρχων τῆσδε γῆς, τούτου πατήρ, πατέρα Θυέστην τὸν ἐμόν, ὡς τορῶς φράσαι, αὑτοῦ δ’ ἀδελφόν, ἀμφίλεκτος ὢν κράτει, ἠνδρηλάτησεν ἐκ πόλεώς τε καὶ δόμων.	For Atreus, this land’s lord, of this man father, Thuestes, my own father — to speak clearly — His brother too, — being i’ the rule contested, — Drove forth to exile from both town and household
Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἰησοῦς τοῖς γραμματεῦσιν τοῦ λαοῦ λέγων	And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying,
ἐν μὲν γὰρ ταῖς μικραῖς πόλεσιν οἱ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι κλίνην, θύραν, ἄροτρον, τράπεζαν, πολλάκις δ’ ὁ αὐτὸς οὗτος καὶ οἰκοδομεῖ, καὶ ἀγαπᾷ ἢν καὶ οὕτως ἱκανοὺς αὐτὸν τρέφειν ἐργοδότας λαμβάνῃ·	For in small towns the same workman makes chairs and doors and plows and tables, and often this same artisan builds houses, and even so he is thankful if he can only find employment enough to support him.
ἐπεὶ δ’ αὐτὰς τὸ ἄστατον καὶ τὸ εὐπαθὲς ἐξίστησι καὶ ἀφέλκει τῆς σελήνης πρὸς ἄλλην γένεσιν, οὐκ ἐᾷ ἀλλ’ ἀνακαλεῖται καὶ καταθέλγει.	because their inconstancy and their being over-subject to passions transports them, and draws them out of the moon to another generation, not letting them rest, but alluring them and calling them away.
ἡ δὲ περὶ τὸν ποταμὸν πραγματεία διαφέρει τοσοῦτον ὅσον τῇ ἐπιμελείᾳ νικᾶν τὴν φύσιν.	The attention and care bestowed upon the Nile is so great as to cause industry to triumph over nature.
τῷ δὲ Προμηθεῖ εἰς μὲν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν τὴν τοῦ Διὸς οἴκησιν οὐκέτι ἐνεχώρει εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς δὲ καὶ αἱ Διὸς φυλακαὶ φοβεραὶ ἦσαν εἰς δὲ τὸ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ Ἡφαίστου οἴκημα τὸ κοινόν, ἐν ᾧ ἐφιλοτεχνείτην, λαθὼν εἰσέρχεται, καὶ κλέψας τήν τε ἔμπυρον τέχνην τὴν τοῦ Ἡφαίστου καὶ τὴν ἄλλην τὴν τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς δίδωσιν ἀνθρώπῳ, καὶ ἐκ τούτου εὐπορία μὲν ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ βίου γίγνεται, Προμηθέα δὲ δι’ Ἐπιμηθέα ὕστερον, ᾗπερ λέγεται, κλοπῆς δίκη μετῆλθεν.	Prometheus could not make so free as to enter the citadel which is the dwelling-place of Zeus, and moreover the guards of Zeus were terrible but he entered unobserved the building shared by Athena and Hephaestus for the pursuit of their arts, and stealing Hephaestus’s fiery art and all Athena’s also he gave them to man, and hence it is that man gets facility for his livelihood, but Prometheus, through Epimetheus’ fault, later on (the story goes) stood his trial for theft.
ὁ δὲ ἀδοξῶν καὶ ὑπερορῶν τοῦ ἐγκλήματος, ἐπεὶ συνῆλθε τὸ δικαστήριον ἧς ἡμέρας ποτὲ Καρχηδόνα παρεστήσατο, θυσίαν προύπεμψεν ἐς τὸ Καπιτώλιον, καὶ ἐς τὸ δικαστήριον αὐτὸς παρῆλθεν ἐπὶ λαμπροῦ σχήματος ἀντὶ οἰκτροῦ καὶ ταπεινοῦ τῶν ὑπευθύνων, ὡς εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τῷδε πάντας ἐκπλῆξαί τε καὶ ἐς εὔνοιαν, ὡς ἐπὶ χρηστῷ δὴ συνειδότι μεγαλοφρονούμενον, προσαγαγέσθαι.	He made light of it and scorned the accusation, and as his trial was set for the day which happened to be the anniversary of his victory over Carthage, he sent victims for sacrifice to the Capitol in advance of his coming, and then made his appearance in court clad in festive garments instead of the mournful and humble garb customary to those under accusation, whereby he made a profound impression on all and predisposed them favorably as to a high-minded citizen conscious of his own rectitude.
ἀλλὰ Καμβύσης ἐξ ἐνυπνίου φοβηθεὶς ὡς βασιλεύσοντα τῆς Ἀσίας τὸν ἀδελφόν, οὐδεμίαν ἀπόδειξιν οὐδ’ ἔλεγχον ἀναμείνας ἀπέκτεινεν.	But Cambyses, being disturbed only with a dream that his brother was like to reign over Asia, without any enquiry after farther evidence or ground for his jealousy, caused him to be put to death.
δέομαι δ’ ὑμῶν πάσῃ τέχνῃ καὶ μηχανῇ μετ’ εὐνοίας ἀκροασαμένους ἡμῶν διὰ τέλους ὅ τι ἂν ὑμῖν ἄριστον καὶ εὐορκότατον νομίζητε εἶναι, τοῦτο ψηφίσασθαι.	and I request you with all the insistence in my power to give us a kindly hearing to the end, and to deliver the verdict that you may esteem best for you and most agreeable to your oaths.
ὡς δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὸν Γάιον σὺν τοῖς λοιποῖς ὁπόσα ἔγραφεν, ἐπαγωγὰ δὲ ἦν τὰ πάντα καὶ παντοίως παρακαλοῦντα μὴ τοσαύτας μυριάδας ἀνθρώπων ἀπονοεῖν, ἃς εἰ κτείνοι, οὐ γὰρ δίχα γε πολέμου παραχωρήσειν τοῦ νομίμου τῆς θρησκείας, προσόδου τε τῆς ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἀποστερεῖσθαι καὶ τῷ τροπαίῳ τῆς ἀρᾶς ὑποτίθεσθαι τὸν μέλλοντα αἰῶνα.	This was also among those other particulars which he wrote to Caius, which all tended to dissuade him, and by all means to entreat him not to make so many ten thousands of these men go distracted whom, if he should slay, (for without war they would by no means suffer the laws of their worship to be set aside,) he would lose the revenue they paid him, and would be publicly cursed by them for all future ages.
τὰ δ’ ἀπαντικρὺ χαλκᾶ, Ἑκάτης καὶ ταῦτα ἀγάλματα, τὸ μὲν Πολύκλειτος ἐποίησε, τὸ δὲ ἀδελφὸς Πολυκλείτου Ναυκύδης†Μόθωνος.	This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hecate, were made respectively by Polycleitus and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon.
ὃς ἀκμάσας καὶ εἰς ἅμιλλαν ἀρετῆς τὸν Ἄρη προκαλεσάμενος ἀνῃρέθη·	In the prime of his youth, he challenged Ares to a duel and was killed.
διὰ δέκα δὲ ἐπάλξεων πύργοι ἦσαν μεγάλοι καὶ ἰσοπλατεῖς τῷ τείχει, διήκοντες ἔς τε τὸ ἔσω μέτωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ αὐτοὶ καὶ τὸ ἔξω, ὥστε πάροδον μὴ εἶναι παρὰ πύργον, ἀλλὰ δι’ αὐτῶν μέσων διῇσαν.	At intervals of every ten battlements were towers of considerable size, and the same breadth as the wall, reaching right across from its inner to its outer face, with no means of passing except through the middle.
Φειδόλαος ὁ Ἁλιάρτιος ἀπαντήσας μικρόν εἶπεν ὑμᾶς ἐνταῦθα περιμεῖναι Σιμμίας. ἐντυγχάνει γὰρ ἰδίᾳ Λεοντίδῃ περὶ Ἀμφιθέου παραιτούμενος μεῖναι τὸ διαπράξασθαι φυγὴν ἀντὶ θανάτου τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ.	Theocritus had just left them, when Phidolaus the Haliartian meeting us said Simmias would have you stay here a little while, for he is interceding with Leontidas for Amphitheus, and begs that instead of dying, according to the sentence, he may be banished.
ἀλλ᾽ οὐ λάβρακας καταφαγὼν Μιλησίους κλονήσεις.	even though you gorged yourself on sea - dogs, you would not beat the milesians.
ὄναρ δ’ ἰδὼν χρυσοῦν θέρος ἐξαμῶντα Μιθριδάτην ἐβουλεύσατο κτεῖναι, καὶ Δημητρίῳ τῷ υἱῷ φράσας ὥρκωσε σιωπῆσαι·	In a dream he saw Mithradates reaping a golden harvest, and thereupon planned to kill him. He told Demetrius his son, and bound him by an oath to silence.
ὄνομα δέ ἐστι μέρος λόγου δηλοῦν ἰδίαν ποιότητα, οἷον Διογένης, Σωκράτης·	whereas a name is a part of speech expressing a quality peculiar to an individual, e.g. Diogenes, Socrates.
χρησάμενος οὖν ὁ Δαυίδης τούτῳ ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀμαληκίτας ὁδηγῷ καὶ καταλαβὼν [αὐτοὺς] ἐπὶ γῆς ἐρριμμένους, καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀριστῶντας, τοὺς δὲ καὶ μεθύοντας ἤδη καὶ λελυμένους ὑπὸ τοῦ οἴνου καὶ τῶν λαφύρων καὶ τῆς λείας ἀπολαύοντας, ἐπιπεσὼν αἰφνιδίως πολὺν αὐτῶν φόνον εἰργάσατο:	David used him to guide him to the Amalekites, and when he overtook them as they sprawled on the ground, some of them at dinner and some drunk and disorderly with wine as they enjoyed their spoils and booty, suddenly he attacked them and made a great slaughter among them.
εἶτα στρατηγία μὲν ἢ σύνταγμά τινα ἀπείρξει γάμου ἢ παιδοποιίας καὶ οὐ δόξει οὗτος ἀντ’ οὐδενὸς ἠλλάχθαι τὴν ἀτεκνίαν, ἡ δὲ τοῦ Κυνικοῦ βασιλεία οὐκ ἔσται ἀνταξία;	then shall the duty of a general or the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or the begetting of children, and such a man shall not be judged to have accepted the condition of childlessness for nothing and shall not the royalty of a Cynic be considered an equivalent for the want of children?
πρόπρυμνα δ᾽ ἐκβολὰν φέρει ἀνδρῶν ἀλφηστᾶν ὄλβος ἄγαν παχυνθείς.	when the fortune of seafaring merchants has grown too great, it must be thrown overboard.
τὴν δ’ ἀρχαιότητα τεκμήριον ἄν τις ποιήσαιτο ἀνδρείας καὶ τῆς ἄλλης ἀρετῆς ἀφ’ ἧς ἀντέσχον μέχρι πρὸς τὸν παρόντα χρόνον.	A proof of their antiquity may be found in the bravery and valour which they have maintained till the present time.
τόν τε Πίνδαρον ἔφασκε δεινὸν εἶναι φωνῆς ἐμπλῆσαι καὶ ὀνομάτων καὶ ῥημάτων εὐπορίαν παρασχεῖν.	Pindar too he declared matchless for imparting fullness of diction and for affording a copious store of words and phrases.
σὺ τοὺς ὑπερηφανίαν ἐργαζομένους Σοδομίτας, ἀδήλους ταῖς κακίαις γενομένους, πυρὶ καὶ θείῳ κατέφλεξας, παράδειγμα τοῖς ἐπιγινομένοις καταστήσας.	You consumed with fire and brimstone the Sodomites who acted insolently, being unknown for depravities, making an example for those who come after.
καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ λόγος οὗτος εἰς ἁμαρτίαν· καὶ ἐπορεύετο ὁ λαὸς πρὸ προσώπου τῆς μιᾶς ἕως Δάν.	This matter became a sin. The people went before the front of the one up to Dan.
ἐπεὶ δὲ μείζω τε ἀγαθὰ ταῦτα καὶ τὴν ἀπόλαυσιν τὴν τούτων ἢ τὴν τῶν ἀρετῶν καὶ ὅτι δι’ αὑτήν, φανερὸν ἐκ τούτων·	yet because they both deem these things and their enjoyment to be greater goods than the enjoyment of the virtues . . . .
ὃς πέποιθεν θρασείᾳ καρδίᾳ, ὁ τοιοῦτος ἄφρων· ὃς δὲ πορεύεται σοφίᾳ σωθήσεται.	The one who relies on a brash heart, such a person is foolish; but the one who proceeds in wisdom will be saved.
ἢν οὖν εἰλικρινὲς τοῦτο ποιήσωμεν, ὃ μιμησαμένοις ἡμῖν συνήνεγκεν, οὐκ ἄδηλον ὅτι ῥᾳδίως τῶν πολεμίων ἐπικρατήσομεν.	If, then, we shall create in reality that which it has profited us to imitate, there can be no doubt that we shall easily overcome our foes.
πάντες γὰρ εἴσονται ὅτι τότε μὲν χιλίαις δραχμαῖς ἐζημιώσατε τὸν βουλόμενον τὴν ἡμετέραν γῆν δημοσίαν ποιῆσαι, νυνὶ δὲ κελεύων δημεῦσαι νενίκηκε, καὶ περὶ τούτων δὴ ἀμφοτέρων Ἀθηναῖοι, παρὰ νόμον φεύγοντος τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀνδρός,	For everyone will know that formerly you punished with a fine of a thousand drachmae the man who proposed that our land should be confiscated, and yet that today he has prevailed with his demand for its confiscation and that in these two suits, in which the same man was illegally prosecuted, the Athenians voted in contradiction of themselves.
ἤλπιζε γὰρ αὐτῶν οὐ μενεῖν τὴν τάξιν, ὥσπερ ἐν γῇ πεζήν, ἀλλὰ ξυμπεσεῖσθαι πρὸς ἀλλήλας τὰς ναῦς καὶ τὰ πλοῖα ταραχὴν παρέξειν, εἴ τ’ ἐκπνεύσειεν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου τὸ πνεῦμα, ὅπερ ἀναμένων τε περιέπλει καὶ εἰώθει γίγνεσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν ἕω, οὐδένα χρόνον ἡσυχάσειν αὐτούς·	For he hoped that this order of theirs would not last long, as in an army on land, but that the galleys would fall foul of one another and be troubled also with the smaller vessels in the midst. And if the wind should also blow out of the gulf, in expectation whereof he so went round them, and which usually blew there every morning, he made account they would then instantly be disordered.
ἐτίθεντο δὲ καὶ παισὶν αὑτῶν Συΐλλους καὶ Βουβούλκους καὶ Καπραρίους ὀνόματα καὶ Πορκίους·	And they actually gave their own sons such surnames as Suillius, Bubulcus, Caprarius, and Porcius
οὔτε γὰρ τοξεύειν ἡμῖν μαθητέον ὥσπερ τοῖς παισί· προεπιστάμεθα γὰρ τοῦτο·	for we have not, like boys, to learn to shoot, for we know how already
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ κύριος τοῦ οἴκου καὶ εἶπεν Μή, ἀδελφοί, μὴ κακοποιήσητε δὴ μετὰ τὸ εἰσελθεῖν τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν μου· μὴ ποιήσητε τὴν ἀφροσύνην ταύτην.	And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and he said, “No, brothers, do not do evil now; do not commit this folly after this man has entered into my house.
ἀπωτέρω δὲ τῆς κώμης ἐπεποίητο ἐν τῷ χθαμαλῷ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς ναὸς καὶ ἄγαλμα ἀρχαῖον ἐλέφαντος.	At some distance from the village on the level ground has been made a temple of Athena with an ancient image of ivory.
ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι μὲν τὰ σαπρὰ ταῦτα ἀπὸ δογμάτων λαλοῦσιν, ὑμεῖς δὲ τὰ κομψὰ ἀπὸ τῶν χειλῶν·	Because they utter their corrupt discourses from sincere opinion, and you your good ones only from your lips.
κατέσχε δ' αὐτὸν ὕσας διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς ὁ θεός: τῶν γὰρ ἐκδοχείων πλησθέντων τοῦ ὕδατος οὐκέτι τῆς φυγῆς ἐδεῖτο, ἀλλὰ τεθαρσηκότες ἤδη καὶ πλέον ἢ κατὰ τὴν εὐπορίαν τοῦ σπανίζοντος, ὡς ἐκ θεοῦ προνοίας ταύτης αὐτοῖς γεγενημένης, ἐπεξιόντες καὶ συμπλεκόμενοι τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἀντίγονον τοῖς μὲν φανερῶς, τοῖς δὲ καὶ λάθρα, πολλοὺς αὐτῶν διέφθειραν.	But God prevented him from leaving by sending rain during the night, which filled their cisterns so that he had no need to escape on account of it. Now they were in better spirits too, since the sending of plenty of water when they needed it seemed a mark of divine Providence, so they made a sortie and fought hand to hand with Antigonus's soldiers, some in the open and some under cover, and killed many of them.
ἢ φαυλότατον ἡγούμενοι σημεῖον εὐνοίας τὸ διδόναι διδόασι γὰρ καὶ ἀλλότριοι καὶ φιλοῦντες ἐκ τοῦ γάμου τὴν τοιαύτην ἀρέσκειαν ἀνεῖλον, ὅπως ἄμισθον καὶ προῖκα καὶ δι’ αὑτὸ μὴ δι’ ἄλλο τὸ φιλεῖσθαι καὶ φιλεῖν;	Or is it that they reputed a gift the basest sign of benevolence (for strangers and they that have no love for us do give us presents), and so took away such a piece of flattery from marriage, that to love and be beloved should be devoid of mercenariness, should be spontaneous and for its own sake, and not for any thing else?
τοῦ μὲν ἀντίθεοι ἀρίστευον υἱέες υἱέων τ’ ἀρηΐφιλοι παῖδες ἀνορέᾳ χάλκεον στονόεντ’ ἀμφέπειν ὅμαδον· σώφρονές τ’ ἐγένοντο πινυτοί τε θυμόν.	His god-like sons and their sons, devoted to war, were the best in manliness, engaged in the brazen battle-throng that causes groans, and they were wise and prudent in spirit.
εἰ οὖν βούλει, σκοπῶμεν ὥσπερ προειπόντες τοῖς θεοῖς ὅτι περὶ αὐτῶν οὐδὲν ἡμεῖς σκεψόμεθα οὐ γὰρ ἀξιοῦμεν οἷοί τ’ ἂν εἶναι σκοπεῖν ἀλλὰ περὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἥν ποτέ τινα δόξαν ἔχοντες ἐτίθεντο αὐτοῖς τὰ ὀνόματα·	So, if you like, let us first make a kind of announcement to the gods, saying that we are not going to investigate about them—for we do not claim to be able to do that—but about men, and let us inquire what thought men had in giving them their names
ἐπὶ γοῦν τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιστημῶν τοῦτο συνενήνοχεν, οἷον ἰατρικὴ κινηθεῖσα παρὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ γυμναστικὴ καὶ ὅλως αἱ τέχναι πᾶσαι καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις, ὥστ’ ἐπεὶ μίαν τούτων θετέον καὶ τὴν πολιτικήν, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ περὶ ταύτην ἀναγκαῖον ὁμοίως ἔχειν.	at all events in the other fields of knowledge this has proved beneficial—for example, medicine has been improved by being altered from the ancestral system, and gymnastic training, and in general all the arts and faculties so that since statesmanship also is to be counted as one of these, it is clear that the same thing necessarily holds good in regard to it as well.
κἀγὼ δόμοις τοῖσδ’ ἄρσεν’ ἐντίκτω κόρον, πλαθεῖσ’ Ἀχιλλέως παιδί, δεσπότῃ γ’ ἐμῷ.	Within these halls have I born a boy to the son of Achilles, my master.
οὐκοῦν ὅτε δὴ τὸ ἐμὲ ποιοῦν ἐμοί ἐστιν καὶ οὐκ ἄλλῳ, ἐγὼ καὶ αἰσθάνομαι αὐτοῦ, ἄλλος δ’ οὔ;	Then, since that which acts on me is to me and to me only, it is also the case that I perceive it, and I only?
συμπαίζων οὖν αὐτοῖς καὶ φιλοφρονούμενος ἔδειξε παίγνια πολλὰ τῶν ξενικῶν.	whereupon he fell to play with them, conforming himself to their humors and showing them many outlandish toys.
Καὶ ὁ μὲν τοιαῦτα ἐπεθείαζεν οὐκ ὢν ἐν ἑαυτῷ τῷ δὲ θείῳ πνεύματι πρὸς αὐτὰ νενικημένος. τοῦ δὲ Βαλάκου δυσχεραίνοντος καὶ παραβαίνειν αὐτὸν τὰς συνθήκας ἐφ' αἷς αὐτὸν ἀντὶ μεγάλων λάβοι δωρεῶν παρὰ τῶν συμμάχων ἐπικαλοῦντος, ἐλθόντα γὰρ ἐπὶ κατάρᾳ τῶν πολεμίων ὑμνεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκείνους καὶ μακαριωτάτους ἀποφαίνειν ἀνθρώπων,	These words Balaam spoke by inspiration, not under his own power, but driven by the divine Spirit to say what he did. But Balak was displeased and accused him of breaking his contract, when he and his allies had invited him with the promise of great gifts. For though he came to curse their enemies, he had praised them instead, declaring them the most fortunate of men.
Ἱππονίκῳ δὲ τῷ Καλλιου πατρί, καὶ δόξαν ἔχοντι μεγάλην καὶ δύναμιν ἀπὸ πλούτου καὶ γένους, ἐνέτριψε κόνδυλον, οὐχ ὑπ’ ὀργῆς ἢ διαφορᾶς τινος προαχθείς, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ γέλωτι, συνθέμενος πρὸς τοὺς ἑταίρους.	He once gave Hipponicus a blow with his fist—Hipponicus, the father of Callias, a man of great reputation and influence owing to his wealth and family—not that he had any quarrel with him, or was a prey to anger, but simply for the joke of the thing, on a wager with some companions.
εἶπεν δὲ τοῦτο οὐχ ὅτι περὶ τῶν πτωχῶν ἔμελεν αὐτῷ, ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι κλέπτης ἦν καὶ τὸ γλωσσόκομον ἔχων τὰ βαλλόμενα ἐβάσταζεν.¶	(Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)
νῦν δὲ ἀπό τε τοῦ ξενικοῦ τοῦ κίειν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς τοῦ ἦτα μεταβολῆς καὶ τῆς τοῦ νῦ ἐνθέσεως κίνησις κέκληται, ἔδει δὲ κιείνησιν καλεῖσθαι . ἡ δὲ στάσις ἀπόφασις τοῦ ἰέναι βούλεται εἶναι, διὰ δὲ τὸν καλλωπισμὸν στάσις ὠνόμασται.	but now by the employment of the foreign word κίειν, change of epsilon to eta, and the insertion of nu it has become κίνησις, though it ought to be κιείνεσις or εἶσις. And στάσις (rest) signifies the negation of motion, but is called στάσις for euphony.
ἢ οὐ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖ; δοκεῖ. καὶ μεγέθει ἄρα τὰ μεγάλα μεγάλα καὶ τὰ μείζω μείζω, καὶ σμικρότητι τὰ ἐλάττω ἐλάττω; ναί.	Do you agree?I do.And great things are great and greater things greater by greatness, and smaller things smaller by smallness?Yes.
οὐ δεῖ δὲ λανθάνειν ὅτι πολλαχοῦ συμβέβηκεν ὥστε τὴν μὲν πολιτείαν τὴν κατὰ τοὺς νόμους μὴ δημοτικὴν εἶναι, διὰ δὲ τὸ ἔθος καὶ τὴν ἀγωγὴν πολιτεύεσθαι δημοτικῶς, ὁμοίως δὲ πάλιν παρ’ ἄλλοις τὴν μὲν κατὰ τοὺς νόμους εἶναι πολιτείαν δημοτικωτέραν, τῇ δ’ ἀγωγῇ καὶ τοῖς ἔθεσιν ὀλιγαρχεῖσθαι μᾶλλον.	but it must not escape notice that in many places it has come about that although the constitution as framed by the laws is not democratic, yet owing to custom and the social system it is democratically administered, and similarly by a reverse process in other states although the legal constitution is more democratic, yet by means of the social system and customs it is carried on rather as an oligarchy.
ταῦτα δ’ ἐστὶ μείζω τῶν προειρημένων ἀλογήματα.	Now this is a worse blunder than the last.
κατάστικτοι δ’ ὁμοίως τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἰλλυριοῖς καὶ Θρᾳξί.	Their bodies are punctured, like those of the other Illyrian and Thracian people.
οὐδὲ μὴν ἄλλου στοχαζόμενος ἔτυχε τούτου·	Nor did the criminal strike the dead man when intending to strike someone else
καὶ μὴν ἵν’ ἀφῶ τὰ στρώματα ἔφη τὸν οἶνον, τὸ μέλι, τοὔλαιον, τὸ γεύσασθαι, τὸ προπιεῖν, ἕτερα πάμπολλα τοῖς αὐτοῖς ὀνόμασι καταφανῶς χρώμενα· τίς οὐκ ἂν εἴποι ἐπὶ κῶμον Ἑλληνικῶς κωμισσᾶτον λέγεσθαι, καὶ τὸ κεράσαι μισκῆραι καθ’ Ὅμηρον, ἡ δ’ αὖτ’ ἐν κρητῆρι μελίφρονα οἶνον ἔμισγε καί μῆνσαν μὲν τὴν τράπεζαν ἀπὸ τῆς·	And not to mention stragula from στρώματα, vinum from οἶνος, oleum from ἔλαιον, mel from μἐλι, gustare from γεύσασθαι, propinare from προπίνειν, and a great many more words which they have plainly borrowed from the Greeks,—who can deny but that they have taken their comessatio, banqueting, from our κῶμος, and miscere, to mingle, from the Greeks too? Thus in Homer, She in a bowl herself mixt (ἔμισγε) generous wine.
ἡ δὲ ἐν Λακεδαίμονι καὶ Μακεδονίᾳ κατὰ γένος· ἀπὸ γάρ τινος γένους ποιοῦνται τὴν βασιλείαν.	But the monarchy in Lacedaemon and in Macedonia is hereditary, for they select the king from a certain family.
ὁ μὲν γὰρ υἱὸν αὑτοῦ ὁ δὲ ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ προσαγορεύει τὸν αὐτόν, ὁ δ’ ἀνεψιόν, ἢ κατ’ ἄλλην τινὰ συγγένειαν πρὸς αἵματος ἢ κατ’ οἰκειότητα καὶ κηδείαν αὑτοῦ πρῶτον ἢ τῶν αὑτοῦ, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἕτερος φράτορα φυλέτην.	for the same person is called ‘my son’ by one man and ‘my brother’ by another, and another calls him ‘nephew,’ or by some other relationship, whether of blood or by affinity and marriage, the speaker's own in the first place, or that of his relations
ὥστε τοὺς θαυμάζοντας τὰς Ἀντιγόνου καὶ Πτολεμαίου καὶ Δημητρίου ναυμαχίας καὶ τοὺς στόλους εἰκότως ἂν περὶ τούτων ἱστορήσαντας ἐκπεπλῆχθαι τὴν ὑπερβολὴν τῶν πράξεων.	Those therefore who have spoken with wonder of the sea-battles of an Antigonus, a Ptolemy, or a Demetrius, and the greatness of their fleets, would we may well believe have been overwhelmed with astonishment at the hugeness of these proportions if they had had to tell the story of this war.
οἱ δὲ τὰς κύνας ἐπάγουσι τοὺς τόπους ζητοῦντες τοὺς καλλίστους·	The huntsmen take the hounds and search for the likeliest places.
οὕτω δ’ εἰς ἀγορὰν τοῦ διηγήματος ἐκκυλισθέντος ὥστε προλαβεῖν τὸν πλασάμενον τὴν φήμην, ἀπαντήσας τις αὐτῷ τῶν γνωρίμων ἀρτίως εἶπεν οἴκοθεν εἰς ἀγορὰν καταβαίνεις;	By this means the story flew about the marketplace before the first deviser of it could get thither. Presently one of his acquaintance meeting him asked, Did ye come straight from your house?
Καὶ ὅτε ἤνοιξεν τὴν σφραγῖδα τὴν τρίτην, ἤκουσα τοῦ τρίτου ζῴου λέγοντος· ἔρχου καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ ἵππος μέλας καὶ ὁ καθήμενος ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἔχων ζυγὸν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.	Then when the Lamb opened the third seal I heard the third living creature saying, "Come!" So I looked, and here came a black horse! The one who rode it had a balance scale in his hand.
καὶ Κάσσανδρον τὸν Ἀντιπάτρου καὶ Λυσίμαχον βασιλεύοντα ἐν Θρᾴκῃ μετασχεῖν ἔπεισε τοῦ πολέμου, φυγὴν λέγων τὴν Σελεύκου καὶ τὸν Ἀντίγονον φοβερόν σφισιν εἶναι πᾶσιν αὐξηθέντα.	He prevailed on Cassander, son of Anti pater, and Lysimachus, who was king in Thrace, to join in the war, urging that Seleucus was in exile and that the growth of the power of Antigonus was dangerous to them all.
τί δέ, ὦ Πῶλε; οἴει σὺ κάλλιον ἂν Γοργίου ἀποκρίνασθαι;	Why, Polus, do you suppose you could answer more excellently than Gorgias?
Αἴας δὲ μετ’ ἐκεῖνον ἠρίστευσε, Τεῦκρος δὲ τῆς τε τούτων συγγενείας ἄξιος καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οὐδενὸς χείρων γενόμενος, ἐπειδὴ Τροίαν συνεξεῖλεν, ἀφικόμενος εἰς Κύπρον Σαλαμῖνά τε κατῴκισεν, ὁμώνυμον ποιήσας τῆς πρότερον αὑτῷ πατρίδος οὔσης, καὶ τὸ γένος τὸ νῦν βασιλεῦον κατέλιπεν.	And Ajax was second to him in valor, and Teucer, who proved himself worthy of their kinship and inferior to none of the other heroes, after he had helped in the capture of Troy, went to Cyprus and founded Salamis, giving to it the name of his former native land and he left behind him the family that now reigns.
καὶ Ξενοφῶν δ’ ἐν τῇ ζʹ τῆς Ἀναβάσεως διηγούμενος τὸ παρὰ τῷ Θρᾳκὶ Σεύθῃ συμπόσιον γράφει οὕτως ·	And Xenophon, in the seventh book of his Anabasis, giving an account of the banquet which was given by the Thracian Seuthes, writes thus
εἰ μὲν τοίνυν τὰ πάνυ σμικρὰ κρίνοι παιδία, κρινοῦσιν τὸν τὰ θαύματα ἐπιδεικνύντα· ἦ γάρ;	If the tiniest children are to be the judges, they will award the prize to the showman of puppets, will they not?
μηδὲ προσέχειν μύθοις καὶ γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις, αἵτινες ζητήσεις παρέχουσιν μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκονομίαν θεοῦ τὴν ἐν πίστει.	nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith.
πολλοὺς γὰρ ἂν καὶ διὰ τὰ οἰκεῖα μίση καὶ διαφορὰς ἰδίας ἐνδείξασθαι τοὺς ἀναιτίους, εἰ διακρίνοι τοὺς τιμωρίας ἀξίους·	for he thought that many would accuse innocent persons, out of their own private animosities and quarrels, if he should attempt to distinguish those that were worthy of punishment from the rest
αὐτὸς δὲ βαρυθυμῶν ἐς τὴν Ἀρδεατῶν πόλιν μετῴκησεν, εὐξάμενος τὴν Ἀχίλλειον εὐχήν, ἐπιποθῆσαι Ῥωμαίους Κάμιλλον ἐν καιρῷ.	In deep grief he went into exile in the city of Ardea, praying the prayer of Achilles that the time might come when the Romans would long for Camillus.
” καὶ ὁ Κοκκήιος “ἑτέρως,” ἔφη, “τάδε λογοποιούμενα οὐδὲ Ἀντώνιος ἐπίστευεν, ἕως ἀπεκλείσθη τοῦ Βρεντεσίου καθάπερ πολέμιος.	"These matters have been told differently," said Cocceius "but Antony did not credit the statements made to him until he was shut out of Brundusium as an enemy."
τί οὖν ἀλλότρια βοηθήματα μολύνεις;	Why, then, do you confound the remedies which might be useful to others?
Διόφαντον γοῦν τὸν Θεμιστοκλέους πολλάκις λέγουσι φάναι καὶ πρὸς πολλοὺς ὡς ὅ τι ἂν αὐτὸς βούληται, τοῦτο καὶ τῷ δήμῳ συνδοκεῖ τῷ τῶν Ἀθηναίων.	Children of distinguished parents are, of course, correspondingly full of exultation and pride. At all events, they say that Cleophantus, the son of Themistocles, often declared to many persons, that whatever he desired was always agreed to by the Athenian people
ἢν δὲ ὅταν μὲν ποιήσῃ ὡς ἂν βούλοιο, ἀντιχαρίσῃ τι αὐτῷ, ὅταν δὲ ἀπειθῇ, κολάζῃς, οὕτω μάλιστ’ ἂν μάθοι τὸ δέον ὑπηρετεῖν.	If, however, you reward him when he behaves as you wish, and punish him when he is disobedient, he will best learn to do his duty.
Περὶ μὲν γὰρ τῆς διακονίας τῆς εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους περισσόν μοί ἐστιν τὸ γράφειν ὑμῖν·	Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
οὐ βαρβάρων νόμοισιν οἰκοῦμεν πόλιν.	Barbarians’ laws are not a standard for our city.
εἰς ταύτην δὲ τὴν αὐλὴν ἐξαφιᾶσι τὸν Ἆπιν καθ’ ὥραν τινὰ καὶ μάλιστα πρὸς ἐπίδειξιν τοῖς ξένοις·	Into this court the Apis is let loose at times, particularly for the purpose of exhibiting him to strangers.
ὃν ὁ τὴν Ἡδυπάθειαν γράψας παρακελεύεται τῷ μὴ δυναμένῳ τιμῇ κατεργάσασθαι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν ἀδικίᾳ κτήσασθαι .	But the author of the Delight of Life, exhorts the man who is unable to purchase enough to satisfy his appetite, to get fish to eat by robbery, rather than go without it.
μεθ᾽ ἧς ἐπόρνευσαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐμεθύσθησαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου τῆς πορνείας αὐτῆς.¶	with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the earth's inhabitants got drunk with the wine of her immorality."
Οὐ γὰρ ὡς μὴ ἐφικνούμενοι εἰς ὑμᾶς ὑπερεκτείνομεν ἑαυτούς· ἄχρι γὰρ καὶ ὑμῶν ἐφθάσαμεν ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ τοῦ χριστοῦ·	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ἤδη τοῦ μὲν γυμνάζειν τοὺς ὄχλους ὠλιγώρει, πεπεισμένος οὐ προσδεήσεσθαι τὰ πράγματα μάχης διὰ τὸ τινῶν μὲν μερῶν Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης ἤδη κυριεύειν, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ἐλπίζειν ἐξ ἑκόντων καὶ διὰ λόγου παραλήψεσθαι, μὴ τολμώντων τὸ παράπαν τῶν περὶ τὸν Πτολεμαῖον εἰς τὸν περὶ τῶν ὅλων συγκαταβαίνειν κίνδυνον.	and from that time forth took no pains to keep the mass of his army under discipline, being persuaded that the business would not call for any more fighting because he was already master of some portions of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and expected to secure the rest by voluntary submission or by diplomacy for Ptolemy, he believed, would not venture upon a general engagement.
θηρᾷ γὰρ οὐδεὶς οὐδὲ λυμαίνεται, πλὴν ὅταν ἐν δικτύοις γενόμενοι κακουργῶσι περὶ τὴν ἄγραν, πληγαῖς κολάζονται καθάπερ παῖδες ἁμαρτάνοντες.	You never heard of any man that fishes for them purposely or hurts them wilfully, unless falling into the nets they spoil the sport, and so, like naughty children, are corrected for their misdemeanors.
τοῖσδε γενναίως πάλαι διεσπάρακται θερμὰ χηνίσκων μέλη, διερράχισται σεμνὰ δελφάκων κρέα, κατηλόηται γαστρὸς οὑν μέσῳ κύκλος, κατῃσίμωται πάντα τἀκροκώλια, νενωγάλισται σεμνὸς ἀλλᾶντος τόμος, παρεντέτρωκται τευθὶς ἐξωπτημένη, παρεκλέλαπται σταμνί’ ἐννέ’ ἢ δέκα.	Long the hot pork has had the meat cut off From the long backbone, and the stuffing, which Lay in the middle of his stomach, has Been served around and all his pettitoes, The dainty slices of fat, well-season'd sausages, Have all been eaten. The well-roasted cuttle-fish Is swallow'd long ago and nine or ten Casks of rich wine are drain'd to the very dregs.
κρατεῖν δὲ τὸν ἄνδρα τῆς γυναικὸς οὐχ ὡς δεσπότην κτήματος ἀλλ’ ὡς ψυχὴν σώματος, συμπαθοῦντα καὶ συμπεφυκότα τῇ εὐνοίᾳ δίκαιόν ἐστιν.	And control ought to be exercised by the man over the woman, not as the owner has control of a piece of property, but, as the soul controls the body, by entering into her feelings and being knit to her through goodwill.
Ἱερώνυμος δὲ τῆς πεδιάδος Θετταλίας καὶ Μαγνήτιδος τὸν κύκλον τρισχιλίων ἀποφαίνεται σταδίων, ᾠκῆσθαι δ’ ὑπὸ Πελασγῶν, ἐξελαθῆναι δὲ τούτους εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν ὑπὸ Λαπιθῶν· εἶναι δὲ τὸ νῦν καλούμενον Πελασγικὸν πεδίον, ἐν Λάρισα καὶ Γυρτώνη καὶ Φεραὶ καὶ Μόψιον καὶ Βοιβηὶς καὶ Ὄσσα καὶ Ὁμόλη καὶ Πήλιον καὶ Μαγνῆτις·	Hieronymus assigns a circuit of 3000 stadia to the plain country in Thessaly and Magnesia, and says, that it was inhabited by Pelasgi, but that these people were driven into Italy by Lapith, and that the present Pelasgic plain is that in which are situated Larisa, Gyrton, Pher, Mopsium, Bbeis, Ossa, Homole, Pelion, and Magnetis.
οἴει τῆς ἐνταῦθα τοῦ χαλκοῦ χρόαςγεγονέναι καὶ ὁ Θέων ὅταν ἔφη τῶν πρώτων καὶ φυσικωτάτων καὶ ἐσομένων καὶ ὄντων, πυρὸς καὶ γῆς καὶ ἀέρος καὶ ὕδατος, μηδὲν ἄλλο τῷ χαλκῷ πλησιάζῃ μηδ’ ὁμιλῇ πλὴν μόνος ὁ ἀήρ, δῆλός ἐστιν ὑπὸ τούτου πεπονθὼς καὶ διὰ τοῦτον ἐσχηκὼς ἣν ἔχει διαφορὰν ἀεὶ συνόντα καὶ προσκείμενον·	Theon replied, When of the primal and simplest elements in Nature, as they are called and actually are — fire, earth, air, and water — there is none other that comes near to the bronze or is in contact with it, save only air, it is clear that the bronze is affected by this, and that because of this it has acquired whatever distinctive quality it has, since the air is always about it and environs it closely.
ἐκ Θάσου δὲ ὁρμηθεὶς ἐπὶ Τορώνην Πολύγονον καὶ Τηλέγονον, τοὺς Πρωτέως τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος υἱούς, παλαίειν προκαλουμένους κατὰ τὴν πάλην ἀπέκτεινε.	From Thasos he proceeded to Torone, and there, being challenged to wrestle by Polygonus and Telegonus, sons of Proteus, son of Poseidon, he killed them in the wrestling match.
εἰ δὴ καὶ τῷ αὐτῷ συμβέβηκεν καὶ ὡς ὕλῃ ἀρχῇ εἶναι καὶ ὡς κινοῦντι, ἀλλὰ τό γ’ εἶναι οὐ ταὐτό.	Now even if it so happens that the same thing is a principle both as matter and as causing motion, still the essence of the two principles is not the same.
ἀνέθηκε δὲ εἰς τὸ ἄδυτον εἴκοσι πηχῶν τὸ εὖρος τῶν δ' αὐτῶν καὶ τὸ μῆκος δύο Χερουβεῖς ὁλοχρύσους πηχῶν ἑκατέραν τὸ ὕψος πέντε, δύο δ' ἦσαν ἑκατέρᾳ πτέρυγες ἐπὶ πέντε πήχεις ἐκτεταμέναι.	He also dedicated for the innermost chamber, which was twenty feet long and wide, two cherubims of solid gold, each five feet high and with two outstretched wings, five feet in length.
ἀκέρδεια λέλογχεν θαμινὰ κακαγόρους.	Often the lot of evil-speakers is profitlessness.
ἐπέπλεον δὲ οὐδέτεροι ἀλλήλοις, ἀλλὰ τὸ θέρος τοῦτο ἀντικαθεζόμενοι χειμῶνος ἤδη ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου ἑκάτεροι.	Neither party made any movement, but they remained confronting each other till the end of the summer, and winter was at hand before either of them returned home.
σὺ δὲ τί οἶσθα, εἰ ἡμεῖς ἂν τούτου κατεψηφισάμεθα; εἴποιμ’ ἄν· διότι πεπαρρησίασθέ μοι καὶ διείλεχθε. καὶ ὁπότε καὶ ὅπου ἕκαστος, ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς ὑπομνήσω·	Now if one of you should ask me, “How do you know that we would vote against him?” I should answer, “Because you have spoken out and told me.” And I will remind you when and where each man of you speaks and tells me
σκοπεῖτε οὖν καὶ αἱρεῖσθε ἤδη ἢ τὴν αὐτίκα ἀκινδύνως δουλείαν ἢ κἂν περιγενόμενοι μεθ’ ἡμῶν τούσδε τε μὴ αἰσχρῶς δεσπότας λαβεῖν καὶ τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἔχθραν μὴ ἂν βραχεῖαν γενομένην διαφυγεῖν. ’ τοιαῦτα μὲν ὁ Ἑρμοκράτης εἶπεν.	Consider, therefore and now make your choice between the security which present servitude offers and the prospect of conquering with us and so escaping disgraceful submission to an Athenian master and avoiding the lasting enmity of Syracuse.’ Such were the words of Hermocrates
ὁ δὲ θεῖος Πλάτων πολλὰ μὲν ἐν τῷ Περὶ ψυχῆς περὶ τῆς ἀθανασίας αὐτῆς εἴρηκεν, οὐκ ὀλίγα δ’ ἐν τῇ Πολιτείᾳ καὶ τῷ Μένωνι καὶ τῷ Γοργίᾳ καὶ σποράδην ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις διαλόγοις.	The divine Plato has said a good deal in his treatise On the Soul about its immortality, and not a little also in the Republic and Meno and Gorgias, and here and there in his other dialogues.
καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος κολοσσοὶ τρεῖς ἑκατέρωθεν ὑπεστηριγμένοι κίοσιν, ὧν τοὺς μὲν ἐκ λαιᾶς χειρὸς εἰσπλεόντων πύργος ναστὸς ἀνέχει, τοὺς δὲ ἐκ δεξιοῦ δύο ὀρθοὶ λίθοι συνεζευγμένοι τοῦ κατὰ θάτερον χεῖλος πύργου μείζονες.	At the mouth of the haven were on each side three great Colossi, supported by pillars, where those Colossi that are on your left hand as you sail into the port are supported by a solid tower but those on the right hand are supported by two upright stones joined together, which stones were larger than that tower which was on the other side of the entrance.
καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄρχοντες υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν πρὸς Ἁννὼν τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν Μὴ παρὰ τὸ δοξάζειν Δαυεὶδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐνώπιόν σου, ὅτι ἀπέστειλέν σοι παρακαλοῦντας; ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως οὐχὶ ἐρευνήσωσιν τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατασκοπήσωσιν αὐτὴν καὶ τοῦ κατασκέψασθαι αὐτὴν ἀπέστειλεν Δαυεὶδ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ πρὸς σέ;	And the rulers of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “It was not from honoring David of your father before you that he sent you messengers for consolation. Rather was it not that he could search the city and examine it closely and to spy on you, that David sent his servants to you?”
καὶ μὴν οἵδ’ ἀγωνισταὶ πικροὶ δεῦρ’ ἐπείγονται ξιφήρεις.	Look! here they come, cruel champions of vengeance, eagerly brandishing their swords.
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀπηλλάγημεν καὶ ἐποιήσαμεν ἅπαντα τὰ νομιζόμενα, καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἤδη παρακαλέσαντες τοὺς οἰκείους ἅπαντας διελεγόμεθα ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς περὶ ὧν οὗτος ἠξίου ἑαυτῷ εἶναι.	So when we had finished all this, and had done all that custom required, we called in all our relatives and quietly discussed with one another the claims which this fellow advanced.
εἶδε γὰρ ὅτι σήραγγας ὁ πλεύμων ἔχει καὶ πόροις κατατέτρηται , δι’ ὧν τὸ ὑγρὸν διίησιν.	For he saw that the lungs have cavities and pores, through which the liquids pass.
ἐπειδὴ δέ μοι δοκεῖς σὺ τρυφᾶν, αὐτός σοι συμπροθυμήσομαι ὅπως ἄν με διδάξῃς περὶ τοῦ ὁσίου.	Since you seem to be indolent, I will aid you myself, so that you may instruct me about holiness.
καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ὅσοι κακουργοῦντες βλάπτουσί τι τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας, τοὺς μὲν τῶν οἴκοι φυλακὴν καταστήσαντας , τοὺς δ’ ἔνδον μένοντας τῆς νυκτὸς , τοὺς δ’ ἑνί γέ τῳ τρόπῳ φυλαξαμένους ἔνεστι διώσασθαι τὴν τῶν κακόν τι ποιεῖν βουλομένων ἐπιβουλήν·	Against all others who in their wrongdoing work harm upon those who come into contact with them men may protect themselves, some by setting a guard over their household effects, others by staying at home at night, so as to suffer no harm, and again, by taking precautions in one way or another men can guard against the plots of those who wish to work them harm
καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἐκόσμησε πολλάκις τὸ ἐν Δελφοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκροθινίων·	The citizens were so successful as to make frequent offerings of the spoils taken in war to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.
καὶ ἐνταῦθα τοὺς μὲν ἡμέρως τε καὶ μετρίως αὐτοῖς χρωμένους ἐπαινεῖν δεῖ, τοὺς δὲ θηριωδῶς καὶ ἀπλήστως ψέγειν.	And at those times we should praise those who indulge in that kind of conversation to a moderate and temperate degree, but blame those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner.
ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν τῷ μέρει ἐκείνῳ πάλιν δώσω δίκην ὅτι ὑμῖν φίλος ἐγενόμην.	and I, in my turn, shall pay to him the penalty for having been your friend.
πάντων δὲ κομψότατον τὸ τῆς πόας, ὅτι ἐν ἠρέμα προσάντει ἱκανὴ πέφυκε κατακλινέντι τὴν κεφαλὴν παγκάλως ἔχειν.	But the most delightful thing of all is the grass, as it grows on the gentle slope, thick enough to be just right when you lay your head on it.
Καὶ ὅτε ἐξῆλθεν ὁ νεανίσκος, ἄρας τὸ πρόσωπον εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐναντίον Ἰερουσαλήμ εὐλόγησεν τῷ βασιλεῖ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ λέγων	Now when the young man went out, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem and blessed the king of heaven, saying,
αὐτοῦ μὲν οὖν τοῦ ὕδατος σκοτεινότατον ὑπὸ πλήθους φαίνεται τὸ βαθύτατον, οἷς δ’ ἀὴρ πλησιάζει, ταῦτα περιλάμπεται καὶ διαγελᾷ.	In fact, of water itself the deepest looks the darkest because there is so much of it, while those parts that lie near the air flash and sparkle
τὰ δὲ βρέφη Φαιστύλος Ἀμουλίου συφορβὸς ἀνείλετο λαθὼν ἅπαντας, ὡς δ’ ἔνιοί φασι τῶν εἰκότων ἐχόμενοι μᾶλλον, εἰδότος τοῦ Νομήτορος καὶ συγχορηγοῦντος τροφὰς κρύφα τοῖς τρέφουσι.	As for the babes, they were taken up and reared by Faustulus, a swineherd of Amulius, and no man knew of it or, as some say with a closer approach to probability, Numitor did know of it, and secretly aided the foster-parents in their task.
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ἀντέχουσι τῷ ψύχει μᾶλλον, ὅτι πολλάκις τὸ ὅμοιον ὑπὸ τοῦ ὁμοίου δυσπαθέστερόν ἐστιν·	For, first, they endure cold better, because one similar quality doth not so readily act upon another
γενέσθαι δὲ τῇ πόλει τὸ ὄνομα οἱ μὲν ἀπὸ Ἀνθηδόνος νύμφης, οἱ δὲ Ἄνθαν δυναστεῦσαι λέγουσιν ἐνταῦθα, Ποσειδῶνός τε παῖδα καὶ Ἀλκυόνης τῆς Ἄτλαντος.	Some say that the city received its name from a nymph called Anthedon, while others say that one Anthas was despot here, a son of Poseidon by Alcyone, the daughter of Atlas.
