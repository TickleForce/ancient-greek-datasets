This repository contains resources from the paper [Sentence Embedding Models for Ancient Greek Using Multilingual Knowledge Distillation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.alp-1.2/), including parallel sentence data (Ancient Greek - English) and evaluation datasets for Ancient Greek sentence embeddings.

The parallel sentence data was primarily produced using a [modified Bertalign implementation](https://github.com/kevinkrahn/grc-sentence-alignment) for sentence alignment.

See the [shlm-grc-en](https://huggingface.co/kevinkrahn/shlm-grc-en) sentence embedding model which was trained on the parallel sentence data in this repository.
